36 dents, the department shall provide for one (1) or more of the remedies
37 described in section 39-3358, Idaho Code.
38 (2) Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting the reme-
39 dies available to the department to remedy a facility's deficiencies. If
40 the department finds that a facility meets the requirements of this chap-
41 ter, but, as of a previous period, intentionally did not meet such require-
42 ments, the department may provide for a civil money penalty under section
43 39-3358(1)(b), Idaho Code, for the days in which it finds that the facility
44 was not in compliance with such requirements.
45 (3) Residential care or assisted living facilities may be cited only
46 for a violation of a requirement that is specified in an applicable law or
47 in a rule promulgated in compliance with an applicable law. Facilities may
48 not be cited for an act that is not expressly proscribed by an applicable law
49 or rule or for an omission when an applicable law or rule does not expressly
20
1 require the conduct omitted. If the department requires a specific correc-
2 tive action in relation to a citation, that requirement must be in writing
3 and reference the corresponding rule.
4 (4) If a civil money penalty is assessed against a facility for defi-
5 ciencies that do not require relocation of residents or facility closure,
6 the facility may use funds equal to the penalty amount to correct the defi-
7 ciencies instead of paying the penalty. Documentation of expenditures ad-
8 dressing the deficiencies must be submitted to the department.
9 (5) Funds collected from such penalties, including those held by the
10 department on July 1, 2025, or collected after such date, may be used by fa-
11 cilities through a department-administered grant program to improve resi-
12 dent care and quality of life. The department shall establish guidelines and
13 a process for grant applications and fund distribution.

21
1 (2) "Homestead" means the dwelling, owner-occupied by the claimant
2 as described in this chapter and used as the primary dwelling place of the
3 claimant and may be occupied by any members of the household as their home,
4 and so much of the land surrounding it, not exceeding one (1) acre, as is
5 reasonably necessary for the use of the dwelling as a home. It may consist
6 of a part of a multidwelling or multipurpose building and part of the land
7 upon which it is built. "Homestead" does not include personal property such
8 as furniture, furnishings or appliances, but a manufactured home may be a
9 homestead.
10 (3) "Household" means the claimant and the claimant's spouse. The term
11 does not include bona fide lessees, tenants, or roomers and boarders on con-
12 tract. "Household" includes persons described in subsection (8)(b) of this
13 section.
14 (4) "Household income" means all income received by the claimant and,
15 if married, all income received by the claimant's spouse, in a calendar year.
16 (5) "Income" means the sum of federal adjusted gross income as defined
17 in the Internal Revenue Code, as defined in section 63-3004, Idaho Code, and
18 to the extent not already included in federal adjusted gross income:
19 (a) Alimony;
20 (b) Support money;
21 (c) Nontaxable strike benefits;
22 (d) The nontaxable amount of any individual retirement account, pen-
23 sion or annuity, including railroad retirement benefits, all payments
24 received under the federal social security act except the social secu-
25 rity death benefit as specified in this subsection, state unemployment
26 insurance laws, and veterans disability pensions and compensation, ex-
27 cluding any return of principal paid by the recipient of an annuity and
28 excluding rollovers as provided in 26 U.S.C. 402 or 403, and excluding

32 its instrumentalities or a state government or any of its instrumental-
33 ities;
34 (f) Worker's compensation; and
35 (g) The gross amount of loss of earnings insurance.
36 It does not include gifts from nongovernmental sources or inheritances. To
37 the extent not reimbursed, the cost of medical care as defined in section
38 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, incurred and paid by the claimant and,
39 if married, the claimant's spouse, may be deducted from income. To the ex-
40 tent not reimbursed, personal funeral expenses, including prepaid funeral
41 expenses and premiums on funeral insurance, of the claimant and claimant's
42 spouse only, may be deducted from income up to an annual maximum of five
43 thousand dollars ($5,000) per claim. "Income" does not include veterans
44 disability pensions received by a person described in subsection (1)(e)
45 of this section who is a claimant or a claimant's spouse if the disability
46 pension is received pursuant to a service-connected disability of a de-
47 gree of forty percent (40%) or more. "Income" does not include dependency
48 and indemnity compensation or death benefits paid to a person described in
49 subsection (1) of this section by the United States department of veterans
50 affairs and arising from a service-connected death or disability. "Income"
22
1 does not include lump sum death benefits made by the social security admin-
2 istration pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 402(i). Documentation of medical expenses
3 may be required by the county assessor and state tax commission in such form
4 as the county assessor or state tax commission shall determine. For pur-
5 poses of this chapter only and in the case of a claimant who owns and whose
6 homestead is a certified family home as defined in section 39-3502, Idaho
7 Code, "income" does not include payments that the claimant received as an
8 enrolled medicaid provider from the medical assistance program. "Income"
9 shall be that received in the calendar year immediately preceding the year
10 in which a claim is filed. Where a claimant and/or the claimant's spouse
11 does not file a federal tax return, the claimant's and/or the claimant's
12 spouse's federal adjusted gross income, for purposes of this section, shall
13 be an income equivalent to federal adjusted gross income had the claimant
14 and/or the claimant's spouse filed a federal tax return, as determined by the
15 county assessor. The county assessor or state tax commission may require
16 documentation of income in such form as each shall determine, including, but
17 not limited to: copies of federal or state tax returns and any attachments
18 thereto; and income reporting forms such as the W-2 and 1099.
19 For determining income for certain married individuals living apart,
20 the provisions of sections 2(c) and 7703(b) of the Internal Revenue Code
21 shall apply.
22 (6) "Occupied" means actual use and possession.
23 (7) "Owner" means a person holding title in fee simple or holding a cer-
24 tificate of motor vehicle title (either of which may be subject to mortgage,
25 deed of trust or other lien) or who has retained or been granted a life estate
26 or who is a person entitled to file a claim under section 63-702, Idaho Code.
27 "Owner" shall also include any person who:
28 (a) Is the beneficiary of a revocable or irrevocable trust which is the
29 owner of such homestead and under which the claimant or the claimant's
30 spouse has the primary right of occupancy of the homestead; or
31 (b) Is a partner of a limited partnership, member of a limited liabil-
32 ity company or shareholder of a corporation if such entity holds title
33 in fee simple or holds a certificate of motor vehicle title and if the
34 person holds at least a five percent (5%) ownership in such entity, as
35 determined by the county assessor; or
36 (c) Has retained or been granted a life estate.
37 "Owner" includes a vendee in possession under a land sale contract. Any
38 partial ownership shall be considered as ownership for determining initial
39 qualification for property tax reduction benefits; however, the amount of
40 property tax reduction under section 63-704, Idaho Code, and rules promul-
41 gated pursuant to section 63-705, Idaho Code, shall be computed on the value
42 of the claimant's partial ownership. "Partial ownership," for the purposes
43 of this section, means any one (1) person's ownership when property is owned
44 by more than one (1) person or where the homestead is held by an entity, as
45 set forth in this subsection, but more than one (1) person has the right of
46 occupancy of such homestead. A person holding either partial title in fee
47 simple or holding a certificate of motor vehicle title together with another
48 person, but who does not occupy the dwelling as his primary dwelling place,
49 shall not be considered an owner for purposes of this section, if such person
50 is a cosignatory of a note secured by the dwelling in question and at least
23
1 one (1) of the other cosignatories of the note occupies the dwelling as his
2 primary dwelling place. The combined community property interests of both
3 spouses shall not be considered partial ownership as long as the combined
4 community property interests constitute the entire ownership of the home-
5 stead, including where the spouses are occupying a homestead owned by an en-
6 tity, as set forth in this subsection, and the spouses have the primary right
7 of occupancy of the homestead. The proportional reduction required under
8 this subsection shall not apply to community property interests. Where
9 title to property was held by a person who has died without timely filing a
10 claim for property tax reduction, the estate of the deceased person shall be
11 the "owner," provided that the time periods during which the deceased person
12 held such title shall be attributed to the estate for the computation of any
13 time periods under subsection (8)(a) or (b) of this section.
14 (8)(a) "Primary dwelling place" means the claimant's dwelling place
15 on January 1 or before April 15 of the year for which the claim is made.
16 The primary dwelling place is the single place where a claimant has
17 his true, fixed and permanent home and principal establishment, and to
18 which whenever the individual is absent he has the intention of return-
19 ing. A claimant must establish the dwelling to which the claim relates
20 to be his primary dwelling place by clear and convincing evidence or by
21 establishing that the dwelling is where the claimant resided on January
22 1 or before April 15 and:
23 (i) At least six (6) months during the prior year; or
24 (ii) The majority of the time the claimant owned the dwelling if
25 owned by the claimant less than one (1) year; or
26 (iii) The majority of the time after the claimant first occupied
27 the dwelling if occupied by the claimant for less than one (1)
28 year. The county assessor may require written or other proof of
29 the foregoing in such form as the county assessor may determine.
30 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsec-
31 tion, the property upon which the claimant makes application shall be
32 deemed to be the claimant's primary dwelling place if the claimant is
33 otherwise qualified and resides in a care facility and does not allow
34 the property upon which the claimant has made application to be occu-
35 pied by persons paying a consideration to occupy the dwelling. Payment
36 of utilities shall not be payment of a consideration to occupy the
37 dwelling. A claimant's spouse who resides in a care facility shall be
38 deemed to reside at the claimant's primary dwelling place and to be a
39 part of the claimant's household. A care facility is a hospital, nurs-
40 ing facility or intermediate care facility for people with intellectual
41 disabilities as defined in section 39-1301, Idaho Code, or a facility
42 as defined in section 39-3302(16), Idaho Code, or a dwelling other than
43 the one upon which the applicant makes application where a claimant who
44 is unable to reside in the dwelling upon which the application is made
45 lives and receives help in daily living, protection and security.
46 SECTION 23. The rules contained in IDAPA 16.03.22, Idaho Department
47 of Health and Welfare, relating to Residential Assisted Living Facilities,
48 Section 001., Subsection 05.; Section 130.; Section 152., Subsection 03.b.;

50 void, and of no force and effect after July 1, 2025.
24
1 SECTION 24. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
2 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after

12 portunities for people with disabilities shall be offered in the most inte-
13 grated setting consistent with their needs.

36 It does not include gifts from nongovernmental sources or inheritances. To
37 the extent not reimbursed, the cost of medical care as defined in section
38 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, incurred and paid by the claimant and,
39 if married, the claimant's spouse, may be deducted from income. To the ex-
40 tent not reimbursed, personal funeral expenses, including prepaid funeral
41 expenses and premiums on funeral insurance, of the claimant and claimant's
42 spouse only, may be deducted from income up to an annual maximum of five
43 thousand dollars ($5,000) per claim. "Income" does not include veterans
44 disability pensions received by a person described in subsection (1)(e)
45 of this section who is a claimant or a claimant's spouse if the disability
46 pension is received pursuant to a service-connected disability of a de-
47 gree of forty percent (40%) or more. "Income" does not include dependency
48 and indemnity compensation or death benefits paid to a person described in
49 subsection (1) of this section by the United States department of veterans
50 affairs and arising from a service-connected death or disability. "Income"

22
1 does not include lump sum death benefits made by the social security admin-
2 istration pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 402(i). Documentation of medical expenses
3 may be required by the county assessor and state tax commission in such form
4 as the county assessor or state tax commission shall determine. For pur-
5 poses of this chapter only and in the case of a claimant who owns and whose
6 homestead is a certified family home as defined in section 39-3502, Idaho
7 Code, "income" does not include payments that the claimant received as an
8 enrolled medicaid provider from the medical assistance program. "Income"
9 shall be that received in the calendar year immediately preceding the year
10 in which a claim is filed. Where a claimant and/or the claimant's spouse
11 does not file a federal tax return, the claimant's and/or the claimant's
12 spouse's federal adjusted gross income, for purposes of this section, shall
13 be an income equivalent to federal adjusted gross income had the claimant
14 and/or the claimant's spouse filed a federal tax return, as determined by the
15 county assessor. The county assessor or state tax commission may require
16 documentation of income in such form as each shall determine, including, but
17 not limited to: copies of federal or state tax returns and any attachments
18 thereto; and income reporting forms such as the W-2 and 1099.
19 For determining income for certain married individuals living apart,
20 the provisions of sections 2(c) and 7703(b) of the Internal Revenue Code
21 shall apply.
22 (6) "Occupied" means actual use and possession.
23 (7) "Owner" means a person holding title in fee simple or holding a cer-
24 tificate of motor vehicle title (either of which may be subject to mortgage,
25 deed of trust or other lien) or who has retained or been granted a life estate
26 or who is a person entitled to file a claim under section 63-702, Idaho Code.
27 "Owner" shall also include any person who:
28 (a) Is the beneficiary of a revocable or irrevocable trust which is the
29 owner of such homestead and under which the claimant or the claimant's
30 spouse has the primary right of occupancy of the homestead; or
31 (b) Is a partner of a limited partnership, member of a limited liabil-
32 ity company or shareholder of a corporation if such entity holds title
33 in fee simple or holds a certificate of motor vehicle title and if the
34 person holds at least a five percent (5%) ownership in such entity, as
35 determined by the county assessor; or
36 (c) Has retained or been granted a life estate.
37 "Owner" includes a vendee in possession under a land sale contract. Any
38 partial ownership shall be considered as ownership for determining initial
39 qualification for property tax reduction benefits; however, the amount of
40 property tax reduction under section 63-704, Idaho Code, and rules promul-
41 gated pursuant to section 63-705, Idaho Code, shall be computed on the value
42 of the claimant's partial ownership. "Partial ownership," for the purposes
43 of this section, means any one (1) person's ownership when property is owned
44 by more than one (1) person or where the homestead is held by an entity, as
45 set forth in this subsection, but more than one (1) person has the right of
46 occupancy of such homestead. A person holding either partial title in fee
47 simple or holding a certificate of motor vehicle title together with another
48 person, but who does not occupy the dwelling as his primary dwelling place,
49 shall not be considered an owner for purposes of this section, if such person
50 is a cosignatory of a note secured by the dwelling in question and at least

23
1 one (1) of the other cosignatories of the note occupies the dwelling as his
2 primary dwelling place. The combined community property interests of both
3 spouses shall not be considered partial ownership as long as the combined
4 community property interests constitute the entire ownership of the home-
5 stead, including where the spouses are occupying a homestead owned by an en-
6 tity, as set forth in this subsection, and the spouses have the primary right
7 of occupancy of the homestead. The proportional reduction required under
8 this subsection shall not apply to community property interests. Where
9 title to property was held by a person who has died without timely filing a
10 claim for property tax reduction, the estate of the deceased person shall be
11 the "owner," provided that the time periods during which the deceased person
12 held such title shall be attributed to the estate for the computation of any
13 time periods under subsection (8)(a) or (b) of this section.
14 (8)(a) "Primary dwelling place" means the claimant's dwelling place
15 on January 1 or before April 15 of the year for which the claim is made.
16 The primary dwelling place is the single place where a claimant has
17 his true, fixed and permanent home and principal establishment, and to
18 which whenever the individual is absent he has the intention of return-
19 ing. A claimant must establish the dwelling to which the claim relates
20 to be his primary dwelling place by clear and convincing evidence or by
21 establishing that the dwelling is where the claimant resided on January
22 1 or before April 15 and:
23 (i) At least six (6) months during the prior year; or
24 (ii) The majority of the time the claimant owned the dwelling if
25 owned by the claimant less than one (1) year; or
26 (iii) The majority of the time after the claimant first occupied
27 the dwelling if occupied by the claimant for less than one (1)
28 year. The county assessor may require written or other proof of
29 the foregoing in such form as the county assessor may determine.
30 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsec-
31 tion, the property upon which the claimant makes application shall be
32 deemed to be the claimant's primary dwelling place if the claimant is
33 otherwise qualified and resides in a care facility and does not allow
34 the property upon which the claimant has made application to be occu-
35 pied by persons paying a consideration to occupy the dwelling. Payment
36 of utilities shall not be payment of a consideration to occupy the
37 dwelling. A claimant's spouse who resides in a care facility shall be
38 deemed to reside at the claimant's primary dwelling place and to be a
39 part of the claimant's household. A care facility is a hospital, nurs-
40 ing facility or intermediate care facility for people with intellectual
41 disabilities as defined in section 39-1301, Idaho Code, or a facility
42 as defined in section 39-3302(16), Idaho Code, or a dwelling other than
43 the one upon which the applicant makes application where a claimant who
44 is unable to reside in the dwelling upon which the application is made
45 lives and receives help in daily living, protection and security.
