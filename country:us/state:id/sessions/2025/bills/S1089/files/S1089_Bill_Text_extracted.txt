23 CHAPTER 65
24 WASTE TIRE DISPOSAL AND RECYCLING
25 39-6501. SHORT TITLE. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as
26 the "Waste Tire Disposal and Recycling Act."
27 39-6502. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. (1) The state of Idaho supports and
28 encourages the reuse and recycling of waste tires. The legislature finds
29 the paramount public interest in regulating waste tires is to protect public
30 health and safety. In particular, the legislature is concerned with elimi-
31 nating potential fire hazards, minimizing or eliminating potential breeding
32 grounds for disease-bearing insects, and eliminating potential sources of
33 surface and ground water contamination.
34 (2) The legislature finds that the Idaho department of environmental
35 quality identified twenty-two (22) abandoned tire piles in the state of
36 Idaho.
37 (3) The legislature finds that the disposal of waste tires is a matter
38 of statewide concern and that recycling of waste tires should be promoted
39 considering the health, environmental, economic benefits, and fire safety
40 benefits.
2
1 (4) The legislature further finds that the recycling of waste tires
2 will decrease the number of tires disposed in landfills and reduce the health
3 and safety hazards posed by abandoned waste tire storage sites not in compli-
4 ance with this chapter.
5 (5) The legislature further finds that the establishment of a fee to
6 be used for partial reimbursement of the costs of transporting, processing,
7 and recycling waste tires; for remediation of waste tire storage sites that
8 are not permitted by or have not received written county or city authoriza-
9 tion for operation; for providing moneys to cities and counties to enforce
10 the provisions of this chapter; and for administration of this chapter by the
11 department of environmental quality is environmentally and economically in
12 the best interest of the state.

23 CHAPTER 65
24 WASTE TIRE DISPOSAL AND RECYCLING
25 39-6501. SHORT TITLE. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as
26 the "Waste Tire Disposal and Recycling Act."
27 39-6502. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. (1) The state of Idaho supports and
28 encourages the reuse and recycling of waste tires. The legislature finds
29 the paramount public interest in regulating waste tires is to protect public
30 health and safety. In particular, the legislature is concerned with elimi-
31 nating potential fire hazards, minimizing or eliminating potential breeding
32 grounds for disease-bearing insects, and eliminating potential sources of
33 surface and ground water contamination.
34 (2) The legislature finds that the Idaho department of environmental
35 quality identified twenty-two (22) abandoned tire piles in the state of
36 Idaho.
37 (3) The legislature finds that the disposal of waste tires is a matter
38 of statewide concern and that recycling of waste tires should be promoted
39 considering the health, environmental, economic benefits, and fire safety
40 benefits.

2
1 (4) The legislature further finds that the recycling of waste tires
2 will decrease the number of tires disposed in landfills and reduce the health
3 and safety hazards posed by abandoned waste tire storage sites not in compli-
4 ance with this chapter.
5 (5) The legislature further finds that the establishment of a fee to
6 be used for partial reimbursement of the costs of transporting, processing,
7 and recycling waste tires; for remediation of waste tire storage sites that
8 are not permitted by or have not received written county or city authoriza-
9 tion for operation; for providing moneys to cities and counties to enforce
10 the provisions of this chapter; and for administration of this chapter by the

23 the consumer price index on the anniversary date of the issuance of the
24 permit or other city or county written authorization. Failure to ad-
25 just the amount of financial assurance on the anniversary date each year

38 should two (2) bond holders become liable on the bond obligation.
39 (f) Counties and cities shall only issue a permit or written authoriza-

7 waste tire storage site fails to comply with the requirements of this sec-
8 tion, the board of county commissioners or city council may declare the site
9 a public nuisance and may declare a public health or safety emergency based
10 on potential fire hazard, threat of insect borne disease, or potential con-
11 tamination of the state's ground or surface waters. If the respective gov-
12 erning authority has declared a public health or safety emergency, the di-
13 rector is authorized and directed to use the fund created in section 39-6508,
14 Idaho Code, for the purpose of removing and properly disposing of the tires
15 upon the recommendation of the state fire marshal in the event of fire haz-

17 ard, or the department in the event of ground or surface water contamination
18 hazard.
19 (a) The director shall be authorized to expend funds from the waste tire
20 recycling and remediation fund if revenues in the fund are sufficient to
21 cover the costs or, if revenues in the waste tire recycling and remedi-

28 cover all costs incurred by the state of Idaho and its political subdi-
29 visions pursuant to this subsection, including but not limited to seek-
30 ing recovery from the owners and operators of an existing or new waste
31 tire storage site of the cost of any grant that may have been awarded
32 pursuant to this chapter.
33 39-6505. WASTE TIRE DISPOSAL. (1) No person shall dispose of waste
34 tires on any public or private property in this state or in the waters of this

36 that have been approved to accept waste tires in their operating plans.
37 (2) Waste tires may be disposed at a permitted public or private munic-
38 ipal solid waste landfill with an approved operating plan only if the waste
39 tires have been processed to meet the following criteria:
40 (a) The volume of one hundred (100) unprepared randomly selected whole
41 tires in one (1) continuous test period shall be reduced by at least
42 sixty-five percent (65%) of the original volume pursuant to subsection

47 sixty-four (64) square inches in any randomly selected sample of ten
48 (10) tires or more. No more than forty percent (40%) of the chips may
49 exceed sixty-four (64) square inches.

7
1 (3) Tire volumes shall be calculated as follows:
2 (a) Unprocessed whole tire volume shall be calculated by randomly
3 placing one hundred (100) unprepared randomly selected whole tires in a
4 rectangular container and multiplying the depth of unprocessed tires by
5 the bottom area of the container; and
6 (b) Processed tire volume shall be determined by randomly placing the
7 processed tire test quantity in a rectangular container and leveling
8 the surface. It shall be calculated by multiplying the depth of pro-
9 cessed tires by the bottom area of the container.
10 39-6506. TRANSPORT OF WASTE TIRES. (1) No person shall transport waste
11 tires for storage to any location in this state other than to a waste tire
