42 tion, the county clerk shall record the party affiliation or unaffiliated

17 laws of the United States known as uniformed and overseas citizens absentee
18 voting act (UOCAVA, 52 U.S.C. 20301 et seq., as amended). The issuing offi-
19 cer shall keep as a part of the records of such officer's office a list of all
20 applications so received and of the manner and time of delivery or mailing to
