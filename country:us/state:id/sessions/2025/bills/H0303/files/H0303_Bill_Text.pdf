11 common law duty of a United States manufacturer or seller of a product that
12 is used in growing food or fiber to warn a consumer or the public about the
13 risks associated with the use of the product shall be presumed to be satis-
14 fied when:

17 ing to accompany the sale or use of a product;

20 ing that product; and

22 ulation.

25 scientific basis on which the required warning is based; and

27 time the product was sold that the required warning was not sup-
28 ported by the clear weight of scientific evidence.
29 (b) At minimum, evidence that the warning provided is not adequate
30 shall be academically peer reviewed, published in a recognized academic
31 journal, capable of replication, and reflect a reliable application of
32 scientific principles and methods to the risks associated with the use
33 of the product.

35 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
