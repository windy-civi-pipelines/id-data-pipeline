LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF IDAHO
Sixty-eighth Legislature First Regular Session - 2025
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
HOUSE BILL NO. 359, As Amended
BY STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
1 AN ACT
2 RELATING TO ELECTIONS; PROVIDING LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT; AMENDING
3 SECTION 67-6614A, IDAHO CODE, TO ESTABLISH PROVISIONS REGARDING THE
4 DISCLOSURE OF PARTY AFFILIATION AND TO PROVIDE CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS; AND
5 DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.
6 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
7 SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. The Legislature finds that
8 the State of Idaho has a substantial interest in preserving the integrity of
9 the electoral process by combating voter confusion. Preventing voter con-
10 fusion is crucial in facilitating secure elections because it directly im-
11 pacts voter confidence, voter participation, and the overall integrity of
12 the electoral process.
13 The Legislature further finds that the disclosure of party affiliation
14 in campaign materials furthers the public policy interest of providing addi-
15 tional information to the voting public. Such party affiliation information
16 is already required to be indicated on the declaration of candidacy forms for
17 candidates running in partisan elections. The disclosure of party affilia-
18 tion in campaign materials is a continuation of disclosure and transparency
19 requirements already implemented in other areas of the electoral process and
20 serves the public interest.
21 The Legislature further finds that clear and accurate communication
22 concerning persons or entities publishing or distributing political state-
23 ments in partisan campaigns reduces the burden on election officials by
24 decreasing the number of voter inquiries and the need for corrective mea-
25 sures. This efficiency allows officials to focus on maintaining security
26 protocols and managing the election process effectively.
27 It is therefore the intent of the Legislature, in order to facilitate
28 the interests described in this section, that any candidate who makes an
29 election communication in a partisan campaign discloses the political af-
30 filiation of such candidate, and if an independent expenditure is made in
31 support or opposition of a candidate in a partisan race, the political party
32 for that candidate is disclosed in the election communication.
33 SECTION 2. That Section 67-6614A, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
34 amended to read as follows:
35 67-6614A. PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF POLITICAL STATEMENTS -- DIS-
36 CLOSURE OF PARTY AFFILIATION -- EXCEPTIONS. (1) Whenever any person makes an
37 expenditure for the purpose of financing communications expressly advocat-
38 ing the election, approval or defeat of a candidate, measure or person stand-
39 ing for election to the position of precinct committeeman through any broad-
40 casting station, newspaper, magazine, outdoor advertising facility, direct
41 mailing or any other type of general public political advertising, the per-

2
1 son responsible for such communication shall be clearly indicated on such
2 communication.
3 (2) Every candidate in any partisan election shall disclose the polit-
4 ical party affiliation of such candidate, if any, in all election communica-
5 tions made by such candidate, except any election communication included on
6 stickers or any item designed to be worn by a person. The candidate's party
7 affiliation disclosure shall be prominently displayed within each election
8 communication. For the purposes of this section, "party affiliation" means
9 the written name of the political party such candidate is registered with or
10 a visual depiction of a commonly recognizable symbol that represents such
11 political party.
12 SECTION 3. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
13 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
14 July 1, 2025.
