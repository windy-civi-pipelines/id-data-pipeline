16 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
17 SECTION 1. That Title 63, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended
18 by the addition thereto of a NEW CHAPTER, to be known and designated as Chap-
19 ter 26, Title 63, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
20 CHAPTER 26
21 COUNTY PROPERTY TAX RELIEF
22 63-2601. SHORT TITLE. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as
23 the "County Property Tax Relief Act."
24 63-2602. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. The legislature finds that the in-
25 creased influx of people traveling to counties for conventions, higher
26 education, recreation, sporting events, and tourism has created a drain
27 on county services that is borne by residential property owners to an in-
28 equitable degree. In addition, the close proximity of a large population
29 center to a county has the additional effect of requiring the county to
30 service the needs of persons traveling to the county on a short-term basis,
31 an effect that is also met by residential property owners of a county to an
32 inequitable degree. The legislature finds that it is equitable to shift
33 this tax burden in part from residential property owners in a county to the
34 visitors utilizing county services. The legislature also finds that this
35 objective must be subject to the approval and supervision of the voters of
36 the county both through their elected county commissioners and through di-
37 rect input at the ballot box.
38 63-2603. DEFINITIONS. As used in this chapter, unless the context re-
39 quires otherwise:

25 hereby have the authority to authorize the board of county commissioners of
26 their county to adopt, implement, and collect a county transient room tax
27 not to exceed three percent (3%) of the sales price of any sale within such
28 county. The board of county commissioners of any county shall hereby have
29 the authority to adopt, implement, and collect a county transient room tax
30 as provided in this chapter, if approved by a majority of all votes cast by
31 the qualified electors of the county voting in an election conducted on the
32 first Tuesday following the first Monday in November. No county transient
33 room tax may be presented to county voters for approval or modification for a
34 period of eleven (11) months after an election to approve or disapprove such
35 tax. The question presented to the voters of a county shall state the rate of
36 the county transient room tax, the duration of the tax, and the purpose of the
37 tax.
38 63-2605. GENERAL PROVISIONS. Prior to collecting the tax authorized
39 under this chapter, the board of county commissioners shall adopt an ordi-
40 nance that:
41 (1) States and defines the specific tax to be assessed;
42 (2) States the exact purpose or purposes for which revenues derived
43 from the tax will be used;
44 (3) States and defines the percentage of the tax to be used for property
45 tax relief, provided that such amount shall not be less than fifty percent
46 (50%) of the annual revenue from the tax; and
47 (4) States the duration of the tax.

3
1 63-2606. AUTHORIZED USES. The board of county commissioners may only
2 use the tax revenue collected pursuant to this chapter for the following pur-
3 poses:
4 (1) To pay for property tax relief for the homeowners of the county as
5 provided in this chapter;
6 (2) To pay for the following public safety services provided by the
7 county:
8 (a) Law enforcement services;
9 (b) Search and rescue services;
10 (c) Emergency medical services; and
11 (d) Fire protection services; and
12 (3) To pay ambulance service districts and fire protection districts
13 in the county if such districts provide emergency medical or fire protection
14 services in the county. Such districts shall be entitled to an apportionment
15 of the tax revenue as provided in this subsection.
16 (a) The county auditor shall quarterly apportion and distribute no more
17 than fifty percent (50%) of tax collections to the county and to each am-
18 bulance service district and fire protection district in the county.
19 (b) Funds shall be apportioned to the county and each ambulance service
20 district and fire protection district in the county based on the propor-
21 tion each such district's current nonexempt property tax budget bears
22 to the sum of the current nonexempt property tax budgets of the county
23 and all such ambulance service districts and fire protection districts
24 in the county. Each year, starting with the distribution for the quar-
25 ter ending December 31, the county auditor shall calculate the distri-
26 bution pursuant to this subsection based on the county's and each dis-
27 trict's current nonexempt property tax budgets. When an ambulance ser-
28 vice district or fire protection district is situated in more than one
29 (1) county, only the portion attributable to the ambulance service dis-
30 trict or fire protection district from each county in which it is situ-
31 ated shall be used in the apportionment of the tax revenue.
32 (c) If ambulance service districts or fire protection districts are
33 consolidated, the resulting district is entitled to an amount equal
34 to the sum of the amounts received in the last calendar quarter by each
35 district prior to the consolidation.
36 (d) If an ambulance service district or fire protection district is
37 dissolved or disincorporated after the apportionment of funds has been
38 determined pursuant to this subsection, the county auditor shall dis-
39 tribute such district's portion of funds to the county until the next
40 calendar year, at which time the funds shall be reapportioned as pro-
41 vided for in this subsection.
42 (e) A county, ambulance service district, or fire district shall use
43 funds received under the provisions of this chapter only for the pur-
44 poses provided for in this section.
45 63-2607. COUNTY PROPERTY TAX RELIEF FUND. (1) Any county assessing a
46 tax pursuant to this chapter shall create and establish in the office of the
47 county treasurer a county property tax relief fund into which shall be placed
48 a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of any revenues received from the county
49 transient room tax.

4
1 (2) On or before the second Monday in September of each year, the county
2 treasurer shall submit to the board of county commissioners a statement
3 showing the balance in the county property tax relief fund as of September
4 1 of that year. The balance of the moneys reflected in such statement shall
5 be used to reduce the amount of the property tax portion of the county's bud-
6 get for that year. For the purposes of the budget limitations provided in
7 section 63-802, Idaho Code, the amount of such revenues that are applied to
8 reduce the county's property tax portion of its budget shall not reduce the
9 amount that a county may increase the property tax portion of its budget and
10 shall be deemed to be included in the amount of property tax revenue certi-
11 fied by the county pursuant to section 63-803, Idaho Code.
12 (3) The moneys applied to reduce the property tax portion of the
13 county's budget shall be designated as a line item credit against the total
14 of county property taxes on the property tax bill for each property owner
15 paying county property taxes in the year such moneys were applied.
16 (4) By no later than December 20 of each year, the county treasurer
17 shall transfer an amount equal to the balance in the county property tax
18 relief fund as of September 1 of that year to the county current expense fund
19 for the reduction in the property tax portion of the budget as provided in
20 this section.
21 63-2608. COLLECTION AND ADMINISTRATION OF COUNTY TRANSIENT ROOM TAX

23 pursuant to this chapter may contract with the state tax commission for the
24 collection and administration of such taxes in like manner and under the def-
25 initions, rules, and regulations of the state tax commission for the collec-
26 tion and administration of the state sales tax under chapter 36, title 63,
27 Idaho Code. A county that levies such tax shall have the right to review and
28 audit the records of collection thereof maintained by the commission and the
29 returns of taxpayers relating to such tax. Alternatively, such county shall
30 have authority to administer and collect such tax on its own.

41 the amount authorized to be expended by appropriation by the legisla-
42 ture; and
43 (c) All remaining moneys received pursuant to this chapter shall be

6 tax commission for collection, reporting, and payment of sales and use and
