12 WHEREAS, the property insurance market has tightened, with carriers
13 withdrawing from some areas of Idaho; and
14 WHEREAS, property insurance companies in some surrounding states have
15 been leaving those states entirely; and
16 WHEREAS, property insurance rates have been increasing significantly
17 for all Idahoans, regardless of where they live; and
