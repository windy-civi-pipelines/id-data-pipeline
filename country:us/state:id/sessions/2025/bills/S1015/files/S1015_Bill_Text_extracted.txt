24 ident, if appropriate, an opportunity to work and be involved in recreation

26 opportunities for people with disabilities shall be offered in the most in-
27 tegrated setting consistent with their needs.

29 staffed by individuals who have the knowledge and experience required to
30 provide safe and appropriate services to all residents of the facility.
31 The administrator of the facility shall ensure that an objective, in-

26 to determine resident needs and shall develop a comprehensive, negotiated
27 plan of service describing how to meet those needs. The care provider shall
28 ensure delivery of appropriate services to meet resident needs as described
29 in the plan of service and shall ensure resident rights are honored and pro-
30 tected.

4 as furniture, furnishings or appliances, but a manufactured home may be a
5 homestead.

48 istration pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 402(i). Documentation of medical expenses
49 may be required by the county assessor and state tax commission in such form
50 as the county assessor or state tax commission shall determine. For pur-
22
1 poses of this chapter only and in the case of a claimant who owns and whose
2 homestead is a certified family home as defined in section 39-3502, Idaho
3 Code, "income" does not include payments that the claimant received as an
4 enrolled medicaid provider from the medical assistance program. "Income"
5 shall be that received in the calendar year immediately preceding the year
6 in which a claim is filed. Where a claimant and/or the claimant's spouse
7 does not file a federal tax return, the claimant's and/or the claimant's
8 spouse's federal adjusted gross income, for purposes of this section, shall
9 be an income equivalent to federal adjusted gross income had the claimant
10 and/or the claimant's spouse filed a federal tax return, as determined by the
11 county assessor. The county assessor or state tax commission may require
12 documentation of income in such form as each shall determine, including, but
13 not limited to: copies of federal or state tax returns and any attachments
14 thereto; and income reporting forms such as the W-2 and 1099.
15 For determining income for certain married individuals living apart,
16 the provisions of sections 2(c) and 7703(b) of the Internal Revenue Code
17 shall apply.
18 (6) "Occupied" means actual use and possession.
19 (7) "Owner" means a person holding title in fee simple or holding a cer-
20 tificate of motor vehicle title (either of which may be subject to mortgage,
21 deed of trust or other lien) or who has retained or been granted a life estate
22 or who is a person entitled to file a claim under section 63-702, Idaho Code.
23 "Owner" shall also include any person who:
24 (a) Is the beneficiary of a revocable or irrevocable trust which is the
25 owner of such homestead and under which the claimant or the claimant's
26 spouse has the primary right of occupancy of the homestead; or
27 (b) Is a partner of a limited partnership, member of a limited liabil-
28 ity company or shareholder of a corporation if such entity holds title
29 in fee simple or holds a certificate of motor vehicle title and if the
30 person holds at least a five percent (5%) ownership in such entity, as
31 determined by the county assessor; or
32 (c) Has retained or been granted a life estate.
33 "Owner" includes a vendee in possession under a land sale contract. Any
34 partial ownership shall be considered as ownership for determining initial
35 qualification for property tax reduction benefits; however, the amount of
36 property tax reduction under section 63-704, Idaho Code, and rules promul-
37 gated pursuant to section 63-705, Idaho Code, shall be computed on the value
38 of the claimant's partial ownership. "Partial ownership," for the purposes
39 of this section, means any one (1) person's ownership when property is owned
40 by more than one (1) person or where the homestead is held by an entity, as
41 set forth in this subsection, but more than one (1) person has the right of
42 occupancy of such homestead. A person holding either partial title in fee
43 simple or holding a certificate of motor vehicle title together with another
44 person, but who does not occupy the dwelling as his primary dwelling place,
45 shall not be considered an owner for purposes of this section, if such person
46 is a cosignatory of a note secured by the dwelling in question and at least
47 one (1) of the other cosignatories of the note occupies the dwelling as his
48 primary dwelling place. The combined community property interests of both
49 spouses shall not be considered partial ownership as long as the combined
50 community property interests constitute the entire ownership of the home-
23
1 stead, including where the spouses are occupying a homestead owned by an en-
2 tity, as set forth in this subsection, and the spouses have the primary right
3 of occupancy of the homestead. The proportional reduction required under
4 this subsection shall not apply to community property interests. Where
5 title to property was held by a person who has died without timely filing a
6 claim for property tax reduction, the estate of the deceased person shall be
7 the "owner," provided that the time periods during which the deceased person
8 held such title shall be attributed to the estate for the computation of any
9 time periods under subsection (8)(a) or (b) of this section.
10 (8)(a) "Primary dwelling place" means the claimant's dwelling place
11 on January 1 or before April 15 of the year for which the claim is made.
12 The primary dwelling place is the single place where a claimant has
13 his true, fixed and permanent home and principal establishment, and to
14 which whenever the individual is absent he has the intention of return-
15 ing. A claimant must establish the dwelling to which the claim relates
16 to be his primary dwelling place by clear and convincing evidence or by
17 establishing that the dwelling is where the claimant resided on January
18 1 or before April 15 and:
19 (i) At least six (6) months during the prior year; or
20 (ii) The majority of the time the claimant owned the dwelling if
21 owned by the claimant less than one (1) year; or
22 (iii) The majority of the time after the claimant first occupied
23 the dwelling if occupied by the claimant for less than one (1)
24 year. The county assessor may require written or other proof of
25 the foregoing in such form as the county assessor may determine.
26 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsec-
27 tion, the property upon which the claimant makes application shall be
28 deemed to be the claimant's primary dwelling place if the claimant is
29 otherwise qualified and resides in a care facility and does not allow
30 the property upon which the claimant has made application to be occu-
31 pied by persons paying a consideration to occupy the dwelling. Payment
32 of utilities shall not be payment of a consideration to occupy the
33 dwelling. A claimant's spouse who resides in a care facility shall be
34 deemed to reside at the claimant's primary dwelling place and to be a
35 part of the claimant's household. A care facility is a hospital, nurs-
36 ing facility or intermediate care facility for people with intellectual
37 disabilities as defined in section 39-1301, Idaho Code, or a facility
38 as defined in section 39-3302(16), Idaho Code, or a dwelling other than
39 the one upon which the applicant makes application where a claimant who
40 is unable to reside in the dwelling upon which the application is made
41 lives and receives help in daily living, protection and security.

14 safe, and homelike living arrangement for adults who need some assistance
15 with activities of daily living and personal care but do not require the
16 level of care identified under section 39-1301(b) care of a nursing facility

18 stays meaning a treatment window designed to allow a resident to receive
19 treatment for a short term acute episode as determined by a licensed profes-

21 The state will encourage the development of facilities tailored to the
22 needs of individual populations which operate in integrated settings in
23 communities where sufficient supportive services exist to provide the res-
24 ident, if appropriate, an opportunity to work and be involved in recreation
25 and education opportunities. Employment, recreational and educational
26 opportunities for people with disabilities shall be offered in the most in-
27 tegrated setting consistent with their needs.
28 A residential care or assisted living facility shall be operated and
29 staffed by individuals who have the knowledge and experience required to
30 provide safe and appropriate services to all residents of the facility.
31 The administrator of the facility shall ensure that an objective, in-
32 dividualized assessment to determine resident needs is conducted, develop a
33 comprehensive negotiated plan of care to meet those needs, deliver appropri-
34 ate services to meet resident needs, and ensure resident rights are honored.

41 each resident's negotiated service plan. Additional staff may be required
42 if physical plant and disability of residents indicate that staff assistance
43 in emergencies is required. Benchmarks shall be established in the assess-
44 ment criteria where the need for certified nursing assistants or licensed
45 nurses is indicated. Residential care or assisted living facilities shall
46 not retain residents who require the care provided by nursing facilities
47 under section 39-1301(b) care at a nursing facility as defined in section

10 more expensive or more restrictive congregate care or institutional care,
11 designed to allow vulnerable adults to reside in a family-style living en-
12 vironment focused on integrated community living. Certified family homes
13 provide housing and care to vulnerable adults who are elderly, who have men-
14 tal illnesses, developmental disabilities, or physical disabilities, or
15 who are otherwise unable to live alone without personal assistance and whose
16 mental, emotional, and physical condition can be met by the care provider.
17 The legislature supports the capabilities of individuals receiving services
18 in certified family homes to direct their own care. The care provider must
19 obtain a waiver under section 39-1301A, Idaho Code, to house and care for
20 two (2) persons requiring care described in section 39-1301(b) at a nursing
21 facility as defined in section 39-1301, Idaho Code.

23 has demonstrated the knowledge and experience required to provide safe and
24 appropriate services to each resident of the certified family home. The care
25 provider shall ensure an objective, individualized assessment is conducted
26 to determine resident needs and shall develop a comprehensive, negotiated
27 plan of service describing how to meet those needs. The care provider shall
28 ensure delivery of appropriate services to meet resident needs as described
29 in the plan of service and shall ensure resident rights are honored and pro-
30 tected.

32 provisions of this chapter. This responsibility includes but is not limited
33 to monitoring the condition of the certified family home, ensuring that

35 enforcement procedures when violations occur.

41 limited to the following:
42 (1) The care provider shall admit or retain no more than two (2) res-
43 idents concurrently in the certified family home. However, the department
44 may grant a variance for up to four (4) residents to receive care in the cer-
45 tified family home upon application by the care provider and upon a finding
46 by the department that the certified family home is able to comply with the
47 requirements of section 39-3507, Idaho Code. The department shall not grant

10
1 a variance for requests to admit or retain more than two (2) residents who re-
2 quire nursing facility level of care as described in section 39-1301(b) care
3 at a nursing facility as defined in section 39-1301, Idaho Code. A variance
4 to exceed the two (2) resident limit in a certified family home shall not be
5 transferable to another resident or care provider. Certified family homes
6 issued a variance to exceed the two (2) resident limit shall be subject to
7 all statutes and rules governing certified family homes but shall not be sub-
8 ject to the residential care facility administrator licensing requirements
9 of chapter 42, title 54, Idaho Code, or the requirements of section 39-3340,
10 Idaho Code. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize in-
11 creased group size for providers of any form of care other than certified
12 family homes.
13 (2) The care provider shall live in the certified family home as the
14 care provider's primary residence.
15 (3) An individual cannot be approved as a care provider operating a
16 certified family home if the individual charges room or board to any person
17 staying in the home who is not resident, a relative of the care provider, or
18 full-time staff. A variance may be granted by the department for the spouse
19 of a resident when the resident's spouse does not require personal assis-
20 tance.
21 (4) A home cannot be approved as a certified family home and for child
22 foster care at the same time unless a variance is granted by the department.
23 (5) The care provider, care provider's relative, or other adult living
24 in the home shall not be the legal guardian of the resident unless the legal
25 guardian is a relative of the resident. A variance may be granted by the de-
26 partment when it determines the guardianship is in the best interest of the
27 nonrelative resident.
28 (6) The care provider must have sufficient resources to maintain the
29 home and the services offered.

39 amination, review of resident rights policy, emergency contacts,

41 belongings the resident or resident representative chooses to in-
42 ventory; and
43 (ii) Ongoing resident records as applicable, including but not
44 limited to: medication management; incidents, accidents, or
45 changes in the resident's condition and the care provider's re-
46 sponse; and financial accounting records for use of the resident's
47 funds when the care provider is deemed to be managing such funds on
48 behalf of the resident.

46 (2) "Homestead" means the dwelling, owner-occupied by the claimant
47 as described in this chapter and used as the primary dwelling place of the
48 claimant and may be occupied by any members of the household as their home,
49 and so much of the land surrounding it, not exceeding one (1) acre, as is

21
1 reasonably necessary for the use of the dwelling as a home. It may consist
2 of a part of a multidwelling or multipurpose building and part of the land
3 upon which it is built. "Homestead" does not include personal property such
4 as furniture, furnishings or appliances, but a manufactured home may be a
5 homestead.
6 (3) "Household" means the claimant and the claimant's spouse. The term
7 does not include bona fide lessees, tenants, or roomers and boarders on con-
8 tract. "Household" includes persons described in subsection (8)(b) of this
9 section.
10 (4) "Household income" means all income received by the claimant and,
11 if married, all income received by the claimant's spouse, in a calendar year.
12 (5) "Income" means the sum of federal adjusted gross income as defined
13 in the Internal Revenue Code, as defined in section 63-3004, Idaho Code, and
14 to the extent not already included in federal adjusted gross income:
15 (a) Alimony;
16 (b) Support money;
17 (c) Nontaxable strike benefits;
18 (d) The nontaxable amount of any individual retirement account, pen-
19 sion or annuity, including railroad retirement benefits, all payments
20 received under the federal social security act except the social secu-
21 rity death benefit as specified in this subsection, state unemployment
22 insurance laws, and veterans disability pensions and compensation, ex-
23 cluding any return of principal paid by the recipient of an annuity and
24 excluding rollovers as provided in 26 U.S.C. 402 or 403, and excluding
25 the nontaxable portion of a Roth individual retirement account distri-
26 bution, as provided in 26 U.S.C. 408A;

28 its instrumentalities or a state government or any of its instrumental-
29 ities;
30 (f) Worker's compensation; and
31 (g) The gross amount of loss of earnings insurance.
32 It does not include gifts from nongovernmental sources or inheritances. To
33 the extent not reimbursed, the cost of medical care as defined in section
34 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, incurred and paid by the claimant and,
35 if married, the claimant's spouse, may be deducted from income. To the ex-
36 tent not reimbursed, personal funeral expenses, including prepaid funeral
37 expenses and premiums on funeral insurance, of the claimant and claimant's
38 spouse only, may be deducted from income up to an annual maximum of five
39 thousand dollars ($5,000) per claim. "Income" does not include veterans
40 disability pensions received by a person described in subsection (1)(e)
41 of this section who is a claimant or a claimant's spouse if the disability
42 pension is received pursuant to a service-connected disability of a de-
43 gree of forty percent (40%) or more. "Income" does not include dependency
44 and indemnity compensation or death benefits paid to a person described in
45 subsection (1) of this section by the United States department of veterans
46 affairs and arising from a service-connected death or disability. "Income"
47 does not include lump sum death benefits made by the social security admin-
48 istration pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 402(i). Documentation of medical expenses
49 may be required by the county assessor and state tax commission in such form
50 as the county assessor or state tax commission shall determine. For pur-

22
1 poses of this chapter only and in the case of a claimant who owns and whose
2 homestead is a certified family home as defined in section 39-3502, Idaho
3 Code, "income" does not include payments that the claimant received as an
4 enrolled medicaid provider from the medical assistance program. "Income"
5 shall be that received in the calendar year immediately preceding the year
6 in which a claim is filed. Where a claimant and/or the claimant's spouse
7 does not file a federal tax return, the claimant's and/or the claimant's
8 spouse's federal adjusted gross income, for purposes of this section, shall
9 be an income equivalent to federal adjusted gross income had the claimant
10 and/or the claimant's spouse filed a federal tax return, as determined by the
11 county assessor. The county assessor or state tax commission may require
12 documentation of income in such form as each shall determine, including, but
13 not limited to: copies of federal or state tax returns and any attachments
14 thereto; and income reporting forms such as the W-2 and 1099.
15 For determining income for certain married individuals living apart,
16 the provisions of sections 2(c) and 7703(b) of the Internal Revenue Code
17 shall apply.
18 (6) "Occupied" means actual use and possession.
19 (7) "Owner" means a person holding title in fee simple or holding a cer-
20 tificate of motor vehicle title (either of which may be subject to mortgage,
21 deed of trust or other lien) or who has retained or been granted a life estate
22 or who is a person entitled to file a claim under section 63-702, Idaho Code.
23 "Owner" shall also include any person who:
24 (a) Is the beneficiary of a revocable or irrevocable trust which is the
25 owner of such homestead and under which the claimant or the claimant's
26 spouse has the primary right of occupancy of the homestead; or
27 (b) Is a partner of a limited partnership, member of a limited liabil-
28 ity company or shareholder of a corporation if such entity holds title
29 in fee simple or holds a certificate of motor vehicle title and if the
30 person holds at least a five percent (5%) ownership in such entity, as
31 determined by the county assessor; or
32 (c) Has retained or been granted a life estate.
33 "Owner" includes a vendee in possession under a land sale contract. Any
34 partial ownership shall be considered as ownership for determining initial
35 qualification for property tax reduction benefits; however, the amount of
36 property tax reduction under section 63-704, Idaho Code, and rules promul-
37 gated pursuant to section 63-705, Idaho Code, shall be computed on the value
38 of the claimant's partial ownership. "Partial ownership," for the purposes
39 of this section, means any one (1) person's ownership when property is owned
40 by more than one (1) person or where the homestead is held by an entity, as
41 set forth in this subsection, but more than one (1) person has the right of
42 occupancy of such homestead. A person holding either partial title in fee
43 simple or holding a certificate of motor vehicle title together with another
44 person, but who does not occupy the dwelling as his primary dwelling place,
45 shall not be considered an owner for purposes of this section, if such person
46 is a cosignatory of a note secured by the dwelling in question and at least
47 one (1) of the other cosignatories of the note occupies the dwelling as his
48 primary dwelling place. The combined community property interests of both
49 spouses shall not be considered partial ownership as long as the combined
50 community property interests constitute the entire ownership of the home-

23
1 stead, including where the spouses are occupying a homestead owned by an en-
2 tity, as set forth in this subsection, and the spouses have the primary right
3 of occupancy of the homestead. The proportional reduction required under
4 this subsection shall not apply to community property interests. Where
5 title to property was held by a person who has died without timely filing a
6 claim for property tax reduction, the estate of the deceased person shall be
7 the "owner," provided that the time periods during which the deceased person
8 held such title shall be attributed to the estate for the computation of any
9 time periods under subsection (8)(a) or (b) of this section.
10 (8)(a) "Primary dwelling place" means the claimant's dwelling place
11 on January 1 or before April 15 of the year for which the claim is made.
12 The primary dwelling place is the single place where a claimant has
13 his true, fixed and permanent home and principal establishment, and to
14 which whenever the individual is absent he has the intention of return-
15 ing. A claimant must establish the dwelling to which the claim relates
16 to be his primary dwelling place by clear and convincing evidence or by
17 establishing that the dwelling is where the claimant resided on January
18 1 or before April 15 and:
19 (i) At least six (6) months during the prior year; or
20 (ii) The majority of the time the claimant owned the dwelling if
21 owned by the claimant less than one (1) year; or
22 (iii) The majority of the time after the claimant first occupied
23 the dwelling if occupied by the claimant for less than one (1)
24 year. The county assessor may require written or other proof of
25 the foregoing in such form as the county assessor may determine.
26 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsec-
27 tion, the property upon which the claimant makes application shall be
28 deemed to be the claimant's primary dwelling place if the claimant is
29 otherwise qualified and resides in a care facility and does not allow
30 the property upon which the claimant has made application to be occu-
31 pied by persons paying a consideration to occupy the dwelling. Payment
32 of utilities shall not be payment of a consideration to occupy the
33 dwelling. A claimant's spouse who resides in a care facility shall be
34 deemed to reside at the claimant's primary dwelling place and to be a
35 part of the claimant's household. A care facility is a hospital, nurs-
36 ing facility or intermediate care facility for people with intellectual
37 disabilities as defined in section 39-1301, Idaho Code, or a facility
38 as defined in section 39-3302(16), Idaho Code, or a dwelling other than
39 the one upon which the applicant makes application where a claimant who
40 is unable to reside in the dwelling upon which the application is made
41 lives and receives help in daily living, protection and security.
42 SECTION 42. The rules contained in IDAPA 16.03.02, Idaho Department of
43 Health and Welfare, relating to Skilled Nursing Facilities, shall be null,
44 void, and of no force and effect on and after July 1, 2025.

9 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
