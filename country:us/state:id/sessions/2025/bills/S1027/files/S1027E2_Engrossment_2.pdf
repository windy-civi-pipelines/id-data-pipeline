2 ter to any person, group of persons, or circumstances is found by a court to

4 sons and circumstances shall be severed and may not be affected. All consti-
5 tutionally valid applications of this chapter shall be severed from any ap-
6 plications that a court finds to be invalid, leaving the valid applications

8 applications be allowed to stand alone. The legislature further declares
9 that it would have passed this chapter, and each provision, section, sub-
10 section, sentence, clause, phrase, or word, and all constitutional applica-
11 tions of this chapter, irrespective of the fact that any provision, section,
12 subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word, or applications of this chap-
13 ter, were to be declared unconstitutional.
