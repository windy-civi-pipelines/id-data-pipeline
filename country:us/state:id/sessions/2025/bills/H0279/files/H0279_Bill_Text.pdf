20 SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. (1) It is the intent of the Legislature
21 for the State of Idaho to move toward an education funding model that dis-
22 tributes funds on a per-student basis that is calculated based on the num-
23 ber of students currently attending each school. Although the provisions of
24 this act do not complete this goal, this act is intended to be a first step in
25 shifting the model for education funding in this direction.
26 (2) It is further the intent of the Legislature that the per-student
27 funding model should be refined to encompass a weighted per-student fund-
28 ing formula that allocates education funding to school districts and public
29 charter schools using a base amount per student and an additional amount for
30 certain weighted student characteristics.
31 (3) It is further the intent of the Legislature to revise the education
32 funding payment schedule to schools.

21 fewer than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance,
22 but shall instead be assigned to the secondary table of the school district
23 in which they are attending the alternative school, unless the alternative
24 school in question serves students from multiple districts reporting fewer
25 than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance. The
26 tables for exceptional education and alternative school support units shall
27 be applicable only for programs approved by the state department of educa-
28 tion following rules established by the state board of education. Moneys

31 and facility costs may be included as part of the alternative school expen-
32 ditures.

36 total state support units to secure the state distribution factor per sup-
37 port unit.
38 (6) (5) District Support Units. The number of support units for each
39 school district in the state shall be determined as follows:
40 (a)(i) Divide the actual average daily attendance, excluding stu-
41 dents approved for inclusion in the exceptional child educational
42 program for the administrative schools and each of the separate
43 schools and attendance units, by the appropriate divisor from the
44 tables of support units in this section, then add the quotients
45 to obtain the district's support units allowance for regular stu-
46 dents, kindergarten through grade 12 including alternative school

11
1 students. Calculations in application of this subsection shall be
2 carried out to the nearest hundredth.
3 (ii) Divide the combined totals of the average daily attendance
4 of all preschool, kindergarten, elementary, secondary, juvenile
5 detention center students and students with disabilities approved
6 for inclusion in the exceptional child program of the district by
7 the appropriate divisor from the table for computation of excep-
8 tional education support units to obtain the number of support
9 units allowed for the district's approved exceptional child pro-
10 gram. Calculations for this subsection shall be carried out to the
11 nearest hundredth when more than one (1) unit is allowed.
12 (iii) The total number of support units of the district shall be
13 the sum of the total support units for regular students, subpara-
14 graph (i) of this paragraph, and the support units allowance for
15 the approved exceptional child program, subparagraph (ii) of this
16 paragraph.
17 (b) Total District Allowance Educational Program. Multiply the dis-
18 trict's total number of support units students as determined by the
19 average daily attendance count, as verified by the state department
20 of education and the legislative services office, pursuant to section
21 33-1003A, Idaho Code, carried out to the nearest hundredth, by the state
22 distribution factor per support unit per-student amount and to this
23 product add the approved amount of programs of the district provided in
24 subsection (2) of this section to secure the district's total allowance
25 for the educational support program.
26 (c) District Share. The district's share of state apportionment is the
27 amount of the total district allowance, paragraph (b) of this subsec-
28 tion.
29 (d) Adjustment of District Share. The contract salary of every noncer-
30 tificated teacher shall be subtracted from the district's share as cal-
31 culated from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this subsection.
32 (7) (6) Property Tax Computation Ratio. In order to receive state funds
33 pursuant to this section, a charter district shall utilize a school mainte-
34 nance and operation property tax computation ratio for the purpose of calcu-
35 lating its maintenance and operation levy that is no greater than that which
36 it utilized in tax year 1994, less four-tenths of one percent (.4%). As used
37 herein, the term "property tax computation ratio" shall mean a ratio deter-
38 mined by dividing the district's certified property tax maintenance and op-
39 eration budget by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment pur-
40 poses as such values existed on December 31, 1993. Such maintenance and op-
41 eration levy shall be based on the property tax computation ratio multiplied
42 by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment purposes as such values
43 existed on December 31 of the prior calendar year.

34 being evaluated, as outlined in administrative rule. The review shall be
35 completed prior to November 1 of each year. The state board of education
36 shall randomly select a sample of administrators throughout the state. A
37 portion of such administrators' instructional staff and pupil service staff
38 employee evaluations shall be independently reviewed. The ratio of in-
39 structional staff evaluations to pupil service staff evaluations shall be
40 equal to the ratio of the statewide instructional staff salary allowance to
41 pupil service staff salary allowance. The state board of education, with
42 input from the Idaho-approved teacher preparation programs and the state
43 department of education, shall identify individuals and a process to conduct
44 the reviews. Administrator certificate holders shall be required to par-
45 ticipate in ongoing evaluation training pursuant to section 33-1204, Idaho

10 the percentage of students meeting their measurable student achievement and
11 student success indicator targets. The department of education shall calcu-
12 late whether or not instructional staff and pupil service staff have met the
13 compensation rung performance criteria based on the data submitted during
14 the previous five (5) years. Individually identifiable performance evalu-
15 ation ratings submitted to the state remain part of the employee's person-
16 nel record and are exempt from public disclosure pursuant to section 74-106,
17 Idaho Code.
18 SECTION 5. That Section 33-1009, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
19 amended to read as follows:
20 33-1009. PAYMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC SCHOOL INCOME FUND.
21 1. a. Payments of the state general account appropriation for public
22 school support shall be made each year by the state department of edu-
23 cation to the public school districts of the state in four (4) payments.
24 Payments to the districts shall be made not later than the fifteenth day
25 of August, the fifteenth day of November, the fifteenth day of February,
26 and the fifteenth day of May each year. The first payment by the state
27 department of education shall be approximately fifty percent (50%) of
28 the total general account appropriation for the fiscal year, while the
29 second and third payments shall be approximately twenty percent (20%)
30 each, and the fourth payment approximately ten percent (10%) respec-
31 tively, except as provided for in section 33-5207, Idaho Code. Amounts
32 apportioned due to a special transfer to the public school income fund
33 to restore or reduce a deficiency in the prior year's transfer pursuant
34 to subsection 4. of this section shall not be subject to this limita-
35 tion.
36 b. Payments of moneys, other than the state general account appropria-
37 tion, that accrue to the public school income fund shall be made by the
38 state department of education to the school districts of the state on
39 the fifteenth day of November, February, May and July each year. The
40 total amount of such payments shall be determined by the state depart-
41 ment of education and shall not exceed the amount of moneys available
42 and on deposit in the public school income fund at the time such payment
43 is made.
44 c. Amounts apportioned due to a special transfer to the public school
45 income fund to restore or reduce a deficiency in the prior year's trans-
46 fer pursuant to subsection 4. of this section shall not be subject to
47 the limitation imposed by paragraphs a. and b. of this subsection.
48 2. Payments made to the school districts in August and November are ad-
49 vance payments for the current year and may be based upon payments from the

17
1 public school income fund for the preceding school year. Each school dis-
2 trict may receive its proportionate share of the advance payments in the same
3 ratio that its total payment for the preceding year was to the total payments
4 to all school districts for the preceding year.
5 3. No later than the fifteenth day of February in each year, the
6 state department of education shall compute the state distribution factor
7 per-student funding based on the total average daily attendance through the
8 first Friday in November. The factor per-student funding will be used in
9 payments of state funds in February and May. Attendance shall be reported in
10 a format and at a time specified by the state department of education.
11 As of the thirtieth day of June of each year the state department of edu-
12 cation shall determine final payments to be made on July fifteenth next suc-
13 ceeding to the several school districts from the public school income fund
14 for the school year ended June 30. The July payments shall take into consid-
15 eration:
16 a. The average daily attendance of the several school districts for the
17 twenty-eight (28) best weeks of the school year completed not later than
18 the thirtieth of June;
19 b. All funds available in the public school income fund for the fiscal
20 year ending on the thirtieth of June;
21 c. All payments distributed for the current fiscal year to the several
22 school districts;
23 d. The adjustment based on the actual amount of discretionary funds
24 per support unit student required by the provisions of section 33-1018,
25 Idaho Code;
26 e. Payments made or due for the transportation support program and the
27 exceptional education support program. The state department of educa-
28 tion shall apportion and direct the payment to the several school dis-
29 tricts the moneys in the public school income fund in each year, taking
30 into account the advance made under subsection 2. of this section, in
31 such amounts as will provide in full for each district its support pro-
32 gram, and not more than therefor required, and no school district shall
33 receive less than fifty dollars ($50.00).
34 4. If the full amount appropriated to the public school income fund
35 from the general account by the legislature is not transferred to the public
36 school income fund by the end of the fiscal year, the deficiency resulting
37 therefrom shall either be restored or reduced through a special trans-
38 fer from the general account in the first sixty (60) days of the following
39 fiscal year, or shall be calculated in computing district levies, and any
40 additional levy shall be certified by the state superintendent of public
41 instruction to the board of county commissioners and added to the district's
42 maintenance and operation levy. If the deficiency is restored or reduced
43 by special transfer, the amount so transferred shall be in addition to the
44 amount appropriated to be transferred in such following fiscal year and
45 shall be apportioned to each school district in the same amount as each would
46 have received had the transfer been made in the year the deficiency occurred.
47 The state department of education shall distribute to the school district
48 the full amount of the special transfer as soon as practical after such
49 transfer is made. In making the levy computations required by this subsec-
50 tion the state department of education shall take into account and consider

18
1 the full amount of money receipted into the public school income fund from
2 all sources for the given fiscal year. Deficits in the transfer of the ap-
3 propriated amount of general account revenue to the public school income
4 fund shall be reduced by the amount, if any, that the total amount receipted
5 from other sources into the public school income fund exceeds the official
6 estimated amount from those sources. The official estimate of receipts from
7 other sources shall be the total amount stated by the legislature in the ap-
8 propriation bill. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any
9 transfers to or from the public education stabilization fund.
10 5. Any apportionments in any year, made to any school district, which
11 may within the succeeding three (3) year period be found to have been in error
12 either of computation or transmittal, may be corrected during the three (3)
13 year period by reduction of apportionments to any school district to which
14 over-apportionments may have been made or received, and corresponding ad-
15 ditions to apportionments to any school district to which under-apportion-
16 ments may have been made or received.
17 SECTION 6. That Section 33-1018, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
18 amended to read as follows:
19 33-1018. PUBLIC SCHOOL DISCRETIONARY FUNDING VARIABILITY. (1) The
20 legislature shall annually state in the appropriation for the educational
21 support program/division of operations the estimate of the total discre-
22 tionary the base funding provided per support unit student. The state
23 department of education shall, before the end of each fiscal year, calculate
24 the actual discretionary funding available per support unit student.
25 (1) If the total estimated discretionary funding per support unit
26 stated in the appropriation for the educational support program/division
27 of operations is lower than the actual discretionary funding available per
28 support unit, then the state controller shall multiply the difference by
29 the number of actual support units, and transfer the result from the public
30 school income fund to the public education stabilization fund and the final
31 distributions to school districts from the department of education shall be
32 reduced by a like amount.
33 (2) If the total estimated discretionary funding per support unit
34 stated in the appropriation for the educational support program/division of
35 operations is greater than the actual discretionary funding available per
36 support unit, then the state controller shall multiply the difference by the
37 number of actual support units, and transfer the result from the public edu-
38 cation stabilization fund to the public school income fund. This transfer
39 shall be limited to moneys available in the public education stabilization
40 fund. Moneys transferred from the public education stabilization fund to
41 the public school income fund under the provisions of this section are hereby
42 continuously appropriated for the educational support program/division of
43 operations.
44 (2) In fiscal year 2026, if the allocation of general discretionary
45 funds for a school district or public charter school is less than one hundred
46 percent (100%) of what the allocation would have been if the allocation was
47 based on support units, then the school district or public charter school
48 shall be funded based on support units.

19
1 SECTION 7. That Section 33-5207, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
2 amended to read as follows:
3 33-5207. PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL FINANCIAL SUPPORT. (1) Except as oth-
4 erwise provided for in this section, the state department of education shall
5 make the following apportionment to each charter school for each fiscal year
6 based on attendance figures submitted in a manner and time as required by the
7 state department of education.
8 (2) Per student support. Computation of support units for each public
9 charter school shall be calculated as if it were a separate school according
10 to the schedules in section 33-1002(4), Idaho Code, except that public char-
11 ter schools with fewer than one hundred (100) secondary ADA shall use a divi-
12 sor of twelve (12) and the minimum units shall not apply. No public charter
13 school shall receive an increase in support units that exceeds the support
14 units it received in the prior year by more than forty (40), except in cases
15 of state declared emergencies that have been approved by the authorizer as
16 having an impact on public education. Funding from the state educational
17 support program shall be equal to the total distribution factor per-student
18 funding, plus the salary-based apportionment provided in chapter 10, title
19 33, Idaho Code. Provided, however, any public charter school that is formed
20 by the conversion of an existing traditional public school shall be assigned
21 divisors, pursuant to section 33-1002, Idaho Code, that are no lower than the
22 divisors of the school district in which the traditional public school is lo-
23 cated, for each category of pupils listed.
24 (3) Special education. For each student enrolled in the public char-
25 ter school who is entitled to special education services, the public charter
26 school shall receive the state and federal funds from the exceptional child
27 education program for that student that would have been apportioned to the
28 school district in which the public charter school is located.
29 (4) Alternative school support. Public charter schools may qualify
30 under the provisions of sections 33-1002 and 33-1002C, Idaho Code, provided
31 the public charter school meets the necessary statutory requirements and
32 students qualify for attendance at an alternative school as provided by rule
33 of the state board of education.
34 (5) Transportation support. Support shall be paid to the public char-
35 ter school as provided in chapter 15, title 33, Idaho Code, and section
36 33-1006, Idaho Code. Each public charter school shall furnish the depart-
37 ment with an enrollment count as of the first Friday in November of public
38 charter school students who are eligible for reimbursement of transporta-
39 tion costs under the provisions of this subsection and who reside more than
40 one and one-half (1 1/2) miles from the school. The state department of edu-
41 cation is authorized to include in the annual appropriation to the charter
42 school sixty percent (60%) of the estimated transportation cost. The final
43 appropriation payment in July shall reflect reimbursements of actual costs
44 pursuant to section 33-1006, Idaho Code. To be eligible for state reimburse-
45 ment under the provisions of section 33-1006, Idaho Code, the student to be
46 transported must reside within the public charter school's primary atten-
47 dance area and must meet at least one (1) of the following criteria:
48 (a) The student resides within the school district in which the public
49 charter school is physically located; or

20
1 (b) The student resides within fifteen (15) miles by road of the public
2 charter school. The limitations placed by this subsection on the reim-
3 bursement of transportation costs for certain students shall not apply
4 to public virtual schools.
5 (6) Facilities funds.
6 (a) The state department of education shall distribute facilities
7 funds to public charter schools for each student in which a majority
8 of the student's instruction is received at a physical facility that
9 is owned or leased by the public charter school. Such funds shall be
10 used to defray the costs associated with payments for real property used
11 by the students or employees of the public charter school for educa-
12 tional or administrative purposes. Such funds shall be distributed at
13 four hundred dollars ($400) per attending student pursuant to section
14 33-1003A, Idaho Code. For the purposes of this paragraph, beginning in
15 state fiscal year 2025, "attending student" means each student in aver-
16 age daily attendance in kindergarten through grade 12 at such physical
17 charter school facilities where the student is enrolled; except that,
18 upon formal approval by the state board of education, a charter school
19 may receive an exemption to the physical facility requirement pursuant
20 to the provisions of this paragraph if the student would have attended a
21 physical facility if not for a stated emergency.
22 (b) For those public charter schools that do not receive facilities
23 funds for all enrolled students, the school may submit to the state
24 department of education a reimbursement claim for any costs for which
25 facilities funds may be used. The state department of education shall
26 reduce such claim by the greater of fifty percent (50%) or the percent-
27 age of the school's enrolled students for which the school receives
28 facilities funds and shall pay the balance. Provided, however, that the
29 total reimbursements paid to a public charter school, in combination
30 with any facilities stipend received by the school, shall not exceed the
31 amount of facilities funds that would have been received by the school
32 had the school received facilities funds for all students in average
33 daily attendance pursuant to section 33-1003A, Idaho Code. For the
34 purposes of this subsection, the term "real property" shall be used as
35 defined in section 63-201, Idaho Code. A virtual public charter school
36 authorized by the public charter school commission or authorized by a
37 public school district on or after March 1, 2024, shall not be eligible
38 for funds appropriated pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
39 (7) Payment schedule. The state department of education is authorized
40 to make an advance payment of twenty-five percent (25%) of a public charter
41 school's estimated annual apportionment for its first year of operation,
42 and each year thereafter, provided the public charter school is serving more
43 grades or at least ten percent (10%) more classes than the previous year, to
44 assist the school with initial start-up costs or payroll obligations. For
45 a public charter school entering at least its second year of operation, the
46 state department of education may require documentation establishing the
47 need for such an advance payment, including comparative class schedules and
48 proof of a commensurate increase in the number of employees.

21
1 (a) For a public charter school to receive the advance payment, the
2 school shall submit its anticipated fall membership for each grade
3 level to the state department of education by June 1.
4 (b) Using the figures provided by the public charter school, the state
5 department of education shall determine an estimated annual apportion-
6 ment from which the amount of the advance payment shall be calculated.
7 Advance payment shall be made to the school on or after July 1 but no
8 later than July 31.
9 (c) All subsequent payments, taking into account the onetime advance
10 payment made for the first year of operation, shall be made to the public
11 charter school in the same manner as other traditional public schools in
12 accordance with the provisions of section 33-1009, Idaho Code. A public
13 charter school shall comply with all applicable fiscal requirements of
14 law, except that the following provisions shall not be applicable to
15 public charter schools: that portion of section 33-1004, Idaho Code,
16 relating to reduction of the administrative and instructional staff
17 allowance and the pupil service staff allowance when there is a dis-
18 crepancy between the number allowed and the number actually employed;
19 and section 33-1004E, Idaho Code, for calculation of district staff
20 indices.
21 (8) If an authorizer has reason to believe that a public charter school
22 cannot remain fiscally sound for the remainder of its certificate term, it
23 shall provide the state department of education with written notification of
24 such concern. Upon receiving such notification, the state department of ed-
25 ucation shall have the authority to modify the percentage of the total appro-
26 priation to be paid to the public charter school pursuant to the provisions
27 of section 33-1009 1., Idaho Code, such that equal percentages are paid on
28 each of the prescribed dates.
29 (9) Each public charter school shall pay an authorizer fee to its au-
30 thorizer, not to initially exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), or, in
31 the case of existing charter schools, up to a five-percent (5%) increase of
32 the previous year's fee. Authorizers shall annually set the authorizer's
33 fee and in doing so shall document the fees to actual expenditures associated
34 with authorizing.
35 (10) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a public charter school from:
36 (a) Applying for federal grant moneys or for career technical education
37 funding of any source; or
38 (b) Receiving funding or other financial assistance for the establish-
39 ment or operation of a public charter school from any private person or
40 organization.
41 (11) Each student in attendance at a public virtual school shall be
42 funded based on either the actual hours of attendance in the public virtual
43 school on a flexible schedule or the percentage of coursework completed,
44 whichever is more advantageous to the school, up to the maximum of one (1)
45 full-time equivalent student.
46 (12) All federal educational funds shall be administered and dis-
47 tributed to public charter schools, including public virtual schools, that
48 have been designated as a local education agency (LEA), as provided in sec-
49 tion 33-5203, Idaho Code.

22
1 (13) Nothing in this section prohibits separate face-to-face learning
2 activities or services. In order to be eligible for career technical educa-
3 tion essential components funding, virtual schools may be required to offer
4 some face-to-face instruction in order to meet industry standards, licens-
5 ing requirements, work-based learning requirements, or other requirements
6 set forth by law.
7 (14) The provisions of section 33-1021, Idaho Code, shall apply to pub-
8 lic charter schools provided for in this chapter.
9 SECTION 8. That Section 33-512D, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
10 amended to read as follows:
11 33-512D. SELF-DIRECTED LEARNER DESIGNATION. (1) A student attending
12 public school in Idaho shall be eligible to be designated as a self-directed
13 learner. For the purposes of this section, a "self-directed learner" means a
14 full-time student:
15 (a) Who demonstrates mastery of content knowledge through grades, as-
16 sessments, or mastery-based learning rubrics;
17 (b) Whose teacher or teachers designate the student as such. The
18 teacher may consider the student's mastery of the content, academic
19 growth, timeliness for assignments, self-motivation, ability to estab-
20 lish goals, and reaching age-appropriate learning outcomes;
21 (c) Who, starting in grade 5, demonstrates mastery of addition and mul-
22 tiplication for numbers 0-10, as well as related subtraction and divi-
23 sion problems, known collectively as "math facts"; and
24 (d) Who, starting in grade 8, demonstrates an informed choice of post-
25 secondary career and education goals by:
26 (i) Completing and updating his student learning plan as defined
27 in section 33-1001(30) 33-1001(31), Idaho Code;
28 (ii) Supplementing his student learning plan, as applicable, with
29 the following that further his postsecondary goals:
30 1. Extended learning opportunities as defined in section
31 33-6401, Idaho Code;
32 2. Courses and examinations funded in chapter 46, title 33,
33 Idaho Code; or
34 3. Any other credits or programs permitted under Idaho Code
35 or district policy as applicable to the student's learning
36 plan; and
37 (iii) Identifying and writing down self-determined personal life
38 goals, including an explanation of how attending specific classes
39 will lead to the fulfillment of personal life goals.
40 (2) Each school district or public charter school may adopt a self-di-
41 rected learner policy to provide processes:
42 (a) Through which students may seek a self-directed learner designa-
43 tion;
44 (b) By which teachers may designate a student as a self-directed
45 learner;
46 (c) To monitor and support self-directed learners;
47 (d) By which a student's teacher or teachers rescind the self-directed
48 learner designation; and
49 (e) As otherwise necessary for implementation.

23
1 (3) Once a student is designated a self-directed learner, the student
2 has the right to flexible learning. Flexible learning may be different for
3 each student and may include flexible attendance, attending school virtu-
4 ally, extended learning opportunities, and any other agreed-upon learning
5 inside or outside the classroom. Starting in grade 8, flexible learning
6 should further the student's progress toward postsecondary goals. Any flex-
7 ible learning permitted under this section must be agreed upon by the stu-
8 dent, his teacher or teachers, and the student's parents or legal guardian.
9 (4) In order to remain a self-directed learner, the student must meet
10 criteria agreed upon by him, his teacher or teachers, and his parents or le-
11 gal guardian. Criteria may include continued mastery of content knowledge
12 and skills, academic growth, progress toward postsecondary goals, or other
13 measures of student learning. If a student fails to meet the agreed-upon
14 criteria or fails to stay current on classroom assignments, and does not cure
15 the failure within an agreed-upon time frame, the building administrator
16 shall rescind the self-directed learner designation upon recommendation by
17 the teacher or teachers.
18 (5) A self-directed learner will be reported as enrolled as one (1.0)
19 FTE or in attendance for a full day in school for the purpose of calculat-
20 ing support units and public school funding. The district or charter school
21 will receive full funding for its self-directed learners, regardless of at-
22 tendance or actual hours of instruction up to one (1) full day of attendance
23 or one (1.0) FTE, or the remaining day or FTE if the student is shared between
24 two (2) or more school districts or public charter schools.
25 (6) Each school district or public charter school must report the num-
26 ber of self-directed learners to the state department of education annually.
27 SECTION 9. That Section 33-515, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
28 amended to read as follows:
29 33-515. ISSUANCE OF RENEWABLE CONTRACTS. (1) During the third full
30 year of continuous employment by the same school district, including
31 any specially chartered district, each certificated employee named in
32 subsection (34) of section 33-1001 section 33-1001(35), Idaho Code, and each
33 school nurse and school librarian who has obtained a professional endorse-
34 ment under section 33-1201A, Idaho Code, shall be evaluated for a renewable
35 contract and shall, upon having been offered a contract for the next ensuing
36 year, and upon signing and timely returning a contract for a fourth full
37 year, be placed on a renewable contract status with said school district
38 entitling such individual to the right to automatic renewal of contract,
39 subject to the provisions included in this chapter, provided that instruc-
40 tional staff who have not obtained a professional endorsement under section
41 33-1201A, Idaho Code, may not be placed on a renewable contract status,
42 provided however, if the career ladder pursuant to section 33-1004B, Idaho
43 Code, is not funded, then a professional endorsement shall not be required.
44 Additionally, any individual who has not successfully completed the three
45 (3) year nontraditional route program while on a three (3) year interim cer-
46 tificate and has not yet been issued a five (5) year renewable certificate
47 may not be placed on a renewable contract. Such individual will remain on
48 a category 3 contract, even after serving three (3) continuous years of em-
49 ployment with the same school district.

24
1 (2) At least once annually, the performance of each renewable contract
2 certificated employee, school nurse, or school librarian shall be evaluated
3 according to criteria and procedures established by the board of trustees in
4 accordance with general guidelines approved by the state board of education.
5 Such an evaluation shall be completed no later than June 1 of each year. The
6 evaluation shall include a minimum of two (2) documented observations, one
7 (1) of which shall be completed prior to January 1 of each year.
8 (3) Any contract automatically renewed under the provisions of this
9 section may be renewed for a shorter term, longer term or the same length
10 of term as stated in the current contract and at a greater, lesser or equal
11 salary as that stated in the current contract. Absent the board's applica-
12 tion of a formal reduction in force, renewals of standard teacher contracts
13 may be for a shorter term, longer term or the same length of term as stated
14 in the current standard teacher contract and at a greater, lesser or equal
15 salary, and shall be uniformly applied to all employees based upon the dis-
16 trict's adopted salary schedule to the extent allowable in section 33-1004E,
17 Idaho Code.
18 (a) Contracts issued pursuant to this section shall be issued on or be-
19 fore the first day of July each year.
20 (b) At the discretion of the board, the district may issue letters of
21 intent for employment for the next ensuing school year to renewable
22 contract status employees during May of each school year. Such let-
23 ter of intent shall not state a specific duration of the contract or
24 salary/benefits term for the next ensuing school year.
25 (c) Unless otherwise negotiated and ratified by both parties pursuant
26 to section 33-1271 et seq., Idaho Code, standard teacher renewals for
27 terms shorter in length than that stated in the current standard con-
28 tract of renewable certificated employees, should be considered and im-
29 plemented only after the district has determined that the salary-based
30 apportionment reimbursement that it estimates it will receive for the
31 ensuing school year is less than the sum the district would otherwise be
32 paying for salaries for certificated professional employees.
33 (4) Nothing in this section shall prevent the board of trustees from of-
34 fering a renewed contract increasing the salary of any certificated person,
35 or from reassigning an administrative employee to a nonadministrative posi-
36 tion with appropriate reduction of salary from the preexisting salary level.
37 In the event the board of trustees reassigns an administrative employee to a
38 nonadministrative position, the board shall give written notice to the em-
39 ployee that contains a statement of the reasons for the reassignment. The
40 employee, upon written request to the board, shall be entitled to an informal
41 review of that decision. The process and procedure for the informal review
42 shall be determined by the local board of trustees.
43 (5) Before a board of trustees can determine not to renew for reasons of
44 an unsatisfactory report of the performance of any certificated person whose
45 contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, such person shall be en-
46 titled to a reasonable period of probation. This period of probation shall
47 be preceded by a written notice from the board of trustees with reasons for
48 such probationary period and with provisions for adequate supervision and
49 evaluation of the person's performance during the probationary period. Such
50 period of probation shall not affect the person's renewable contract status.

25
1 Consideration of probationary status for certificated personnel is consid-
2 eration of the status of an employee within the meaning of section 74-206,
3 Idaho Code, and may be held in executive session. If the consideration re-
4 sults in probationary status, the individual on probation shall not be named
5 in the minutes of the meeting. A record of the decision shall be placed in the
6 teacher's personnel file.
7 (6) If the board of trustees takes action to immediately discharge
8 or discharge upon termination of the current contract a certificated per-
9 son whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, the action
10 of the board shall be consistent with the procedures specified in section
11 33-513(5), Idaho Code, and, furthermore, the board shall notify the employee
12 in writing whether there is just and reasonable cause not to renew the con-
13 tract or to reduce the salary of the affected employee, and, if so, what
14 reasons it relied upon in that determination.
15 (7) If the board of trustees takes action after the declaration of a fi-
16 nancial emergency pursuant to section 33-522, Idaho Code, and such action is
17 directed at more than one (1) certificated employee, and if mutually agreed
18 to by both parties, a single informal review shall be conducted. Without
19 mutual consent of both parties, the board of trustees shall use the follow-
20 ing procedure to conduct a single due process hearing within sixty-seven
21 (67) days of the declaration of financial emergency pursuant to section
22 33-522(2), Idaho Code, or on or before June 22, whichever shall occur first:
23 (a) The superintendent or any other duly authorized administrative of-
24 ficer of the school district may recommend the change in the length of
25 the term stated in the current contract or reduce the salary of any cer-
26 tificated employee by filing with the board of trustees written notice
27 specifying the purported reasons for such changes.
28 (b) Upon receipt of such notice, the board of trustees, acting through
29 its duly authorized administrative official, shall give the affected
30 employees written notice of the reductions and the recommendation of
31 the change in the length of the term stated in the current contract or
32 the reduction of salary, along with written notice of a hearing be-
33 fore the board of trustees prior to any determination by the board of
34 trustees.
35 (c) The hearing shall be scheduled to take place not less than six (6)
36 days nor more than fourteen (14) days after receipt of the notice by the
37 employees. The date provided for the hearing may be changed by mutual
38 consent.
39 (d) The hearing shall be open to the public.
40 (e) All testimony at the hearing shall be given under oath or affirma-
41 tion. Any member of the board, or the clerk of the board of trustees, may
42 administer oaths to witnesses or affirmations by witnesses.
43 (f) The employees may be represented by legal counsel and/or by a repre-
44 sentative of a local or state education association.
45 (g) The chairman of the board of trustees or the designee of the chair-
46 man shall conduct the hearing.
47 (h) The board of trustees shall cause an electronic record of the hear-
48 ing to be made or shall employ a competent reporter to take stenographic
49 or stenotype notes of all the testimony at the hearing. A transcript of

26
1 the hearing shall be provided at cost by the board of trustees upon re-
2 quest of the employee.
3 (i) At the hearing, the superintendent or other duly authorized admin-
4 istrative officer shall present evidence to substantiate the reduction
5 contained in such notice.
6 (j) The employees may produce evidence to refute the reduction. Any
7 witness presented by the superintendent or by the employees shall be
8 subject to cross-examination. The board of trustees may also examine
9 witnesses and be represented by counsel.
10 (k) The affected employees may file written briefs and arguments with
11 the board of trustees within three (3) days after the close of the hear-
12 ing or such other time as may be agreed upon by the affected employees
13 and the board of trustees.
14 (l) Within seven (7) days following the close of the hearing, the board
15 of trustees shall determine and, acting through its duly authorized ad-
16 ministrative official, shall notify the employees in writing whether
17 the evidence presented at the hearing established the need for the ac-
18 tion taken.
19 The due process hearing pursuant to this subsection shall not be required if
20 the board of trustees and the local education association reach an agreement
21 on issues agreed upon pursuant to section 33-522(3), Idaho Code.
22 (8) If the board of trustees, for reasons other than unsatisfactory
23 service, for the ensuing contract year, determines to change the length of
24 the term stated in the current contract, reduce the salary or not renew the
25 contract of a certificated person whose contract would otherwise be automat-
26 ically renewed, nothing herein shall require a probationary period.
27 (9) If the board of trustees, for reasons other than unsatisfactory
28 service, for the ensuing contract year, determines to change the length
29 of the term stated in the current contract or reduce the salary of a cer-
30 tificated person whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed,
31 nothing herein shall require any individualized due process proceeding. In
32 such circumstance, the board shall hold a single informal review for all im-
33 pacted employees. The process and procedure for the single informal review
34 shall be determined by the local board of trustees.
35 SECTION 10. That Section 33-911, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
36 amended to read as follows:
37 33-911. SCHOOL DISTRICT FACILITIES FUND. (1) There is hereby cre-
38 ated in the state treasury the school district facilities fund. The fund
39 shall consist of moneys provided pursuant to sections 57-811, 63-3638, and
40 67-7434, Idaho Code, and any legislative transfers or appropriations. In-
41 terest earned from the investment of moneys in the fund shall be returned to
42 the fund.
43 (2) The moneys in the fund shall be distributed by the state controller
44 to the state department of education by August 1 each year for the purpose
45 of construction or renovation of school facilities. The moneys shall be
46 distributed by the state department of education to each school district, as
47 defined in section 33-1001(21) 33-1001(22), Idaho Code, first as provided
48 in subsection (7) of this section and then on a per-pupil basis using the
49 average daily attendance calculation provided in section 33-1003A, Idaho

27
1 Code, for each student in kindergarten through grade 12 at physical facil-
2 ities that are part of and on school grounds of the school district in which
3 the student is enrolled with verification, as needed, by the office of the
4 state board of education. Upon formal approval by the state board of edu-
5 cation, a school district may receive an exemption to the physical facility
6 requirement pursuant to this subsection if the student would have attended
7 a physical facility in the school district if not for a stated emergency.
8 The state department of education shall transfer the moneys by no later than
9 August 31 each year to each school district. Such moneys shall be used in
10 place of property tax levy moneys and shall be expended by a school district
11 for one (1) or more of the purposes set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of
12 this subsection. Moneys in the fund must be used by a school district in the
13 following order of priority:
14 (a) Payment of existing school bonds authorized pursuant to chapter 11,
15 title 33, Idaho Code;
16 (b) Payment of supplemental school levies authorized pursuant to sec-
17 tion 33-802, Idaho Code, excluding indefinite term supplemental levies
18 described in section 33-802(5), Idaho Code;
19 (c) Payment of school plant facility levies authorized pursuant to sec-
20 tions 33-804 and 33-804A, Idaho Code; and
21 (d) Any moneys that remain following the payments provided in para-
22 graphs (a) through (c) of this subsection may be: used for construction
23 of a new school facility, renovation, or maintenance needs; used to
24 secure and make payments on a new school facilities bond; or saved in
25 a reserve account by the school district for future school facility
26 needs. Uses of funds shall include regular and routine facilities
27 maintenance, including preventive maintenance, building repairs, and
28 building security, and periodic major facilities projects that involve
29 planning, design, construction, renovation, retrofitting, and replac-
30 ing of buildings and building systems, components, and features, as
31 well as site acquisition, site improvements, and new construction.
32 (3) The amount of moneys received by a school district pursuant to this
33 section must be deducted from a school levy that would otherwise have been
34 paid by property taxpayers. Such moneys may not be duplicated by the collec-
35 tion of property tax, and no property taxes may be collected in order to make
36 extra payments on expenses described in subsection (2) of this section in ex-
37 cess of required amounts.
38 (4) Each school district shall identify the amount received in the cur-
39 rent year pursuant to this section in the certification of its budget in ac-
40 cordance with section 63-803, Idaho Code. Said amount must be subtracted
41 from the amount to be levied. The amount of moneys thereby saved from being
42 collected by a property tax levy shall be reported on each property tax no-
43 tice pursuant to section 63-902, Idaho Code.
44 (5) Each school district shall report annually to the state department
45 of education, in a manner prescribed by it, on the expenditure of moneys it
46 has received pursuant to this section. The state department of education
47 shall present the reports to the legislature each January.
48 (6) For the purposes of this section, the Idaho school for the deaf and
49 the blind shall be considered a school district and shall receive a distribu-
50 tion based on the average daily attendance of the school.

28
1 (7)(a) For state fiscal year 2025 only, any school district that would
2 have received support from the bond levy equalization support program
3 for a qualified bond passed prior to January 1, 2024, and for which prop-
4 erty taxes were levied in property tax year 2023 pursuant to the amount
5 intended by the bond shall receive a distribution of funds from the dis-
6 tribution provided under subsection (2) of this section of at least as
7 much as would have been provided through bond levy equalization support
8 on July 1, 2024.
9 (b) For state fiscal year 2026 only, any school district that would have
10 received support from the bond levy equalization support program for a
11 qualified bond passed prior to January 1, 2024, and for which property
12 taxes were levied in property tax year 2024 pursuant to the amount in-
13 tended by the bond shall receive a distribution of funds from the dis-
14 tribution provided under subsection (2) of this section of at least as
15 much as would have been provided through bond levy equalization support
16 on July 1, 2025.
17 (c) The state department of education may adjust distributions for re-
18 maining districts proportionally as necessary pursuant to this para-
19 graph. On and after July 1, 2024, school districts may use funds pro-
20 vided in this section and section 33-913, Idaho Code, to offset the bond
21 levy equalization support.
22 SECTION 11. That Section 33-915, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
23 amended to read as follows:
24 33-915. FIXED DISTRIBUTION -- SCHOOL MODERNIZATION FACILITIES
25 FUND. (1) The state department of education shall establish a fixed distri-
26 bution of funds to be made available for voluntary election to each school
27 district subject to the conditions in this section.
28 (a) The distribution shall be calculated in state fiscal year 2025 for
29 each school district, as defined in section 33-1001(21) 33-1001(22),
30 Idaho Code, that is in operation as of July 1, 2024.
31 (b) The distribution shall be calculated by multiplying the following
32 two (2) factors, both of which shall be based on the most recent data
33 available in the state fiscal year coinciding with the distribution
34 calculation:
35 (i) Calculate the per-pupil amount, using the average daily at-
36 tendance calculation provided in section 33-1003A, Idaho Code,
37 for each student in kindergarten through grade 12 at physical
38 facilities that are part of and on school grounds of the school
39 district in which the student is enrolled with verification, as
40 needed, by the office of the state board of education. Upon formal
41 approval by the state board of education, a school district may re-
42 ceive an exemption to the physical facility requirement pursuant
43 to this subsection if the student would have attended a physical
44 facility in the school district if not for a stated emergency; and
45 (ii) Calculate, together with the Idaho state building authority,
46 the total amount that a bond issuance would generate, based on the
47 amount established in section 63-3638(19), Idaho Code.

29
1 (c) In no case shall the amount awarded to any school district be less
2 than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) over the ten (10) year pe-
3 riod.
4 (d) In no case shall the amount awarded to any school district with an
5 active charter district maintenance and operation levy pursuant to sec-
6 tion 33-802(6), Idaho Code, or a charter district supplemental mainte-
7 nance and operation levy pursuant to section 33-802(4), Idaho Code, ex-
8 ceed forty million dollars ($40,000,000) over the ten (10) year period.
9 Excess funds shall be distributed proportionately according to the
10 factors established in paragraph (b) of this subsection to remaining
11 school districts that received initial allocations below forty million
12 dollars ($40,000,000). Any districts receiving reallocations under
13 this paragraph shall not exceed forty million dollars ($40,000,000).
14 (e) For the purposes of this section, the Idaho school for the deaf and
15 the blind shall be considered a school district and shall receive a dis-
16 tribution based on the average daily attendance of the school.
17 (2) The provisions of this section shall be null, void, and of no force
18 and effect on and after June 30, 2034.
19 SECTION 12. That Section 33-1004, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
20 amended to read as follows:
21 33-1004. STAFF ALLOWANCE. For each school district, a staff allowance
22 shall be determined as follows:
23 (1) Using the daily attendance reports that have been submitted for
24 computing the February 15 apportionment of state funds as provided in sec-
25 tion 33-1009, Idaho Code, calculate the total support units for the district
26 in the manner provided in section 33-1002(6)(a)(5)(a), Idaho Code. If the
27 support units used to calculate discretionary funding pursuant to sections
28 33-1009 and 33-1018, Idaho Code, are at least three percent (3%) greater,
29 seventy-five percent (75%) of the difference shall be added to the support
30 units used for the February 15 apportionment of state funds;
31 (2) Determine the instructional staff allowance by multiplying the
32 support units by 1.021. A district must demonstrate that it actually employs
33 the number of certificated instructional staff allowed, except as provided
34 in subsection (6)(f) and (g) of this section. If the district does not employ
35 the number allowed, the staff allowance shall be reduced to the actual number
36 employed, except as provided in subsection (6)(f) and (g) of this section;
37 (3) Determine the pupil service staff allowance by multiplying the sup-
38 port units by 0.079;
39 (4) Determine the administrative staff allowance by multiplying the
40 support units by .075;
41 (5) Determine the classified staff allowance by multiplying the sup-
42 port units by .375;
43 (6) Additional conditions governing staff allowance:
44 (a) In determining the number of staff in subsections (2), (3), (4) and
45 (5) of this section, a district may contract separately for services to
46 be rendered by nondistrict employees and such employees may be counted
47 in the staff allowance. A "nondistrict employee" means a person for
48 whom the school district does not pay the employer's obligations for
49 employee benefits. When a district contracts for the services of a

30
1 nondistrict employee, only the salary portion of the contract shall be
2 allowable for computations.
3 (b) If there are circumstances preventing eligible use of staff al-
4 lowance to which a district is entitled as provided in subsections (2),
5 (3) and (4) of this section, an appeal may be filed with the state de-
6 partment of education outlining the reasons and proposed alternative
7 use of these funds, and a waiver may be granted.
8 (c) For any district with less than forty (40) support units:
9 (i) The instructional staff allowance shall be calculated
10 applying the actual number of support units. If the actual in-
11 structional staff employed in the school year is greater than the
12 instructional staff allowance, then the instructional staff al-
13 lowance shall be increased by one-half (1/2) staff allowance; and
14 (ii) The administrative staff allowance shall be calculated ap-
15 plying the actual number of support units. If the actual adminis-
16 trative staff employed in the school year is greater than the ad-
17 ministrative staff allowance, then the administrative staff al-
18 lowance shall be increased by one-half (1/2) staff allowance.
19 (iii) Additionally, for any district with less than twenty (20)
20 support units, the instructional staff allowance shall be calcu-
21 lated applying the actual number of support units. If the number
22 of instructional staff employed in the school year is greater than
23 the instructional staff allowance, the staff allowance shall be
24 increased as provided in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this para-
25 graph, and by an additional one-half (1/2) instructional staff al-
26 lowance.
27 (d) For any school district with one (1) or more separate secondary
28 schools serving grades 9 through 12, the instructional staff allowance
29 shall be increased by two (2) additional instructional staff allowances
30 for each such separate secondary school.
31 (e) Only instructional, pupil service and administrative staff and
32 classified personnel compensated by the school district from the gen-
33 eral maintenance and operation fund of the district shall be included in
34 the calculation of staff allowance or in any other calculations based
35 upon staff, including determination of the experience and education
36 multiplier, the reporting requirements, or the district's salary-based
37 apportionment calculation. No food service staff or transportation
38 staff shall be included in the staff allowance.
39 (f) A district may utilize up to fifteen percent (15%) of the moneys
40 associated with positions funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this
41 section to pay another school district or public charter school for
42 instructional services or to defray the cost of providing virtual edu-
43 cation coursework, including virtual dual credit coursework, without a
44 reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed.
45 (g) A district may employ nine and one-half percent (9.5%) fewer posi-
46 tions than funded pursuant to subsections (2) and (3) of this section,
47 without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed.
48 Beginning in fiscal year 2016, this figure shall be reduced by one per-
49 cent (1%) each year for each school district in which the average class
50 size, as determined from prior fiscal year data reported to the state

31
1 department of education, was at least one (1) student greater than the
2 statewide average class size. The state department of education shall
3 report to the legislature every February, beginning in 2015, on the re-
4 ductions scheduled to take place in this figure, by school district, in
5 the ensuing fiscal year.
6 (i) In the determination of statewide average class size, the
7 state department of education shall not use a single figure de-
8 veloped through the averaging of all districts of varying size,
9 geographical location and pupil populations throughout the state.
10 The statewide average class size shall be comprised of multiple
11 figures determined through analysis of like and similarly sit-
12 uated districts and use of the divisor breakdown established in
13 section 33-1002, Idaho Code.
14 (ii) The state board of education may promulgate rules outlining
15 the method of calculation of the statewide average class size fig-
16 ures.
17 (iii) The one percent (1%) reduction required in paragraph (g) of
18 this subsection shall not be applicable for any school year subse-
19 quent to a year when the school district's boundaries have changed
20 because of division, consolidation, excision or annexation of
21 territory.
22 (7) In the event that the staff allowance in any category is insuffi-
23 cient to meet accreditation standards, a district may appeal to the state
24 board of education, demonstrating the insufficiency, and the state board may
25 grant a waiver authorizing sufficient additional staff to be included within
26 the staff allowance to meet accreditation standards. Such a waiver shall be
27 limited to one (1) year, but may be renewed upon showing of continuing justi-
28 fication.
29 (8) A district may utilize a portion of the instructional staff al-
30 lowance provided for in this section for kindergarten teachers to visit the
31 parents or guardians of students during the first week of the kindergarten
32 school year. Such visits may take place at school, at the student's home
33 or at another location agreed to by the teacher and parents or guardians.
34 The purpose of such visits is to help strengthen the working relationship
35 between the teacher, the parents or guardians, and the student. The visits
36 should be used as an opportunity to help establish the teacher's expecta-
37 tions of the student. The visit should also provide an opportunity for the
38 parents or guardians to explain their expectations. The amount of moneys to
39 be expended for such visits by the district may not exceed the amount equal
40 to one (1) week of instructional staff allowance computed for kindergarten
41 instructors in the district.
