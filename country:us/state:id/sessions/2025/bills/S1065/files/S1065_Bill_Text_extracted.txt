25 that is assessed or proposed to be assessed by such district, which right has
26 been adjudicated or decreed by the court or is represented by valid permit or
27 license issued by the department of water resources.
28 (2) Such meeting shall be held at some place within the water district,
29 or at some nearby location convenient to a majority of those entitled to vote
30 thereat. The director of the department of water resources shall, at least
31 twenty-one (21) days prior to the meeting date, send notification by regu-
32 lar mail to all persons, companies, corporations or other entities known by
33 the director to hold rights that are assessed or proposed to be assessed by

35 is represented by valid permit or license issued by the department of wa-
36 ter resources, of the time, date, location and purpose of the annual meet-
37 ing. At any annual meeting, the water users may vote to waive the require-
38 ment for notice by mail and provide for notice to be given for future meet-
39 ings by publication of the time, date, location and purpose of the meeting
40 in a newspaper or newspapers in general circulation in the district or on the

44 days prior to the meeting. Notice on the department of water resources web-
45 site shall be posted at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the meeting date.
46 At any annual meeting, the water users may vote to change the date for an-
3
1 nual meetings in subsequent years to any day, except Saturday and Sunday, be-
2 tween the second Monday of January and the fourth Tuesday of May. At an an-
3 nual meeting, the water users may adopt resolutions to assure or improve the
4 distribution of the waters of the district within state law and may provide
5 that such resolutions shall continue from year to year.
6 (3) At the meeting of the water users of a district, there shall be
7 elected a watermaster for such water district, who may be authorized to em-
8 ploy such other regular assistants as the water users shall deem necessary,
9 and who, upon appointment by the director, shall be responsible for distri-
10 bution of water within said water district. Notwithstanding any personnel
11 classification assigned to the watermaster and assistants pursuant to the
12 provisions of chapter 53, title 67, Idaho Code, the water users shall, prior
13 to the election of such watermaster and approval of the employment of assis-
14 tants, fix the compensation to be paid them during the time actually engaged
15 in the performance of their duties.
16 (4) Voting shall be by majority vote of the water users present at the
17 meeting unless one (1) or more water users requests voting using the pro-
18 cedure which follows in this subsection. In such case, the meeting chair-
19 man shall appoint a credentials committee to determine the number of votes
20 each water user present is authorized to cast. If requested, each person
21 present who owns or has the use for the ensuing season of any water right in
22 the stream or water supply comprising such water district that is assessed or
23 proposed to be assessed by such district, which right has been adjudicated
24 or decreed by the court or is represented by valid permit or license issued
25 by the department of water resources, shall be entitled to a number of votes
26 equal to the average annual dollar amount and any fraction thereof assessed
27 for that person's qualifying water right for the previous five (5) years, or
28 such lesser number of years as the right has been assessed. If a right has
29 not previously been assessed, a person present who owns or has the use of the
30 right for the ensuing season shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to
31 the dollar amount and any fraction thereof that the right would have been as-
32 sessed had it existed and been reasonably used when water was available under
33 the priority of the right during the previous season. Absentee voting and
34 voting by proxy are prohibited.
35 (5) At such meeting, the water users shall choose a meeting chairman and
36 meeting secretary. The water users of any water district that collects or
37 pays district expenses in accordance with section 42-613(3) or 42-619, Idaho
38 Code, shall also elect a water district treasurer. Within five (5) business
39 days after such meeting, the meeting chairman and meeting secretary shall
40 forward a certified copy of the minutes of such meeting to the department of
41 water resources. The meeting chairman, or the meeting secretary if the meet-
42 ing chairman is not present, from the immediately preceding annual meeting
43 shall call the meeting to order and preside over the election of officers for
44 the meeting.
45 (6) At such meeting, the water users may choose an advisory committee
46 to be composed of members selected as may be determined at the meeting, which
47 committee shall serve as advisors to the director and the watermaster in mat-
48 ters pertaining to the distribution of water within the district. The advi-
49 sory committee may be authorized to carry out policies as set forth in reso-
50 lutions duly adopted by the water users at the annual meeting or at a special
4
1 meeting. The advisory committee may also serve as the local committee to fa-
2 cilitate the rental of stored water if appointed by the water resource board
3 for such purpose under the provisions of section 42-1765, Idaho Code.
4 (7) A corporation or a water delivery organization, including but not
5 limited to a water company, an irrigation district, an irrigation company or
6 a canal company, shall be considered a person for the purpose of this section
7 and shall designate someone to cast its vote.
8 (8) Should said meeting not be held, or should said watermaster not be
9 elected or the watermaster's compensation not be fixed as above provided,
10 then the director is authorized to appoint a watermaster and fix the water-
11 master's compensation.
12 (9) The director may remove any watermaster whenever such watermaster
13 fails to perform the watermaster's duty, upon complaint made to the direc-
14 tor in writing, by one (1) person owning or having the right to the use of a
15 water right that is assessed by such district, which right has been adjudi-
16 cated or decreed by the court or is represented by valid permit or license is-
17 sued by the department of water resources, provided, that upon investigation
18 the director, after a hearing with the other water users of said district,
19 which shall be held in the district or at some location convenient to the wa-
20 ter users of the district, finds such charge to be true, and the director may
21 appoint a successor for the unexpired term.
22 (10) Before entering upon the duties of the watermaster's office, said
23 watermaster shall take and subscribe to an oath before some officer autho-
24 rized by the laws of the state to administer oaths, to faithfully perform
25 the duties of the watermaster's office, as provided in section 42-607, Idaho
26 Code, and shall file that oath with the department of water resources. Upon
27 appointment by the director, the actions taken by a watermaster in fulfill-
28 ment of the duties of the office are covered by the state group surety bond
29 as provided by sections 59-801 through 59-804, Idaho Code. A duly appointed
30 watermaster that is reelected in consecutive years shall not be required to
31 take and file additional oaths with the department of water resources for
32 each consecutive year the watermaster is reelected. If a duly elected or ap-
33 pointed watermaster resigns, dies or is physically unable to perform the du-
34 ties of the office during the remainder of the elected or appointed watermas-
35 ter term of service, then the director is authorized to appoint a successor
36 for the unexpired term as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsec-
37 tion.
38 (a) If a water district advisory committee has been chosen as provided
39 in subsection (6) of this section, the water district advisory commit-
40 tee shall meet to either nominate a successor watermaster or request a
41 special meeting as provided in subsection (11) of this section to elect
42 a new watermaster. Upon receipt of a nomination from a majority of the
43 members of the water district advisory committee, the director is au-
44 thorized to appoint the nominated successor watermaster for the unex-
45 pired term.
46 (b) If a water district advisory committee has not been chosen, the
47 director of the department of water resources is authorized to appoint
48 a temporary successor watermaster. The temporary appointment extends
49 through the unexpired term unless a special meeting is requested as
5
1 provided in subsection (11) of this section and water users elect a new
2 watermaster.
3 (11) The director shall call a special meeting of the water district
4 upon receipt of a written request for such meeting from a majority of the
5 members of the advisory committee for a district, a written request from
6 water users representing thirty percent (30%) or more of the votes cast at
7 the last regular annual meeting, a written request from the watermaster, or
8 on the director's own motion if the director determines a meeting is neces-
9 sary to address matters that cannot be delayed until the next regular annual
10 meeting. Notice of the time, place and purpose of the special meeting shall
11 be given by the director in the manner provided in subsection (2) of this sec-
12 tion, provided however, that a special meeting notice shall be sent at least
13 fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting date.
14 (12) The water users may, by resolution, authorize the watermaster to
15 acquire, hold and dispose of such real and personal property, equipment and
16 facilities in the name of the water district as necessary for the proper dis-
17 tribution of water, administration of the water district and enhancement of
18 water supplies and shall provide that all such real and personal property
19 shall remain in the custody of the watermaster and the watermaster's succes-
20 sor.
21 (13) The water users may, by resolution, authorize the watermaster to
22 develop, coordinate or provide, through contract or by other means, for
23 weather modification projects involving cloud seeding that are designed to
24 increase the water supplies of the water district by enhancing natural pre-
25 cipitation and which conform to state water planning objectives.

25 that is assessed or proposed to be assessed by such district, which right has
26 been adjudicated or decreed by the court or is represented by valid permit or
27 license issued by the department of water resources.
28 (2) Such meeting shall be held at some place within the water district,
29 or at some nearby location convenient to a majority of those entitled to vote
30 thereat. The director of the department of water resources shall, at least
31 twenty-one (21) days prior to the meeting date, send notification by regu-
32 lar mail to all persons, companies, corporations or other entities known by
33 the director to hold rights that are assessed or proposed to be assessed by

35 is represented by valid permit or license issued by the department of wa-
36 ter resources, of the time, date, location and purpose of the annual meet-
37 ing. At any annual meeting, the water users may vote to waive the require-

2 tween the second Monday of January and the fourth Tuesday of May. At an an-
3 nual meeting, the water users may adopt resolutions to assure or improve the
4 distribution of the waters of the district within state law and may provide
5 that such resolutions shall continue from year to year.
6 (3) At the meeting of the water users of a district, there shall be
7 elected a watermaster for such water district, who may be authorized to em-
8 ploy such other regular assistants as the water users shall deem necessary,
9 and who, upon appointment by the director, shall be responsible for distri-
10 bution of water within said water district. Notwithstanding any personnel
11 classification assigned to the watermaster and assistants pursuant to the
12 provisions of chapter 53, title 67, Idaho Code, the water users shall, prior
13 to the election of such watermaster and approval of the employment of assis-
14 tants, fix the compensation to be paid them during the time actually engaged
15 in the performance of their duties.
16 (4) Voting shall be by majority vote of the water users present at the
17 meeting unless one (1) or more water users requests voting using the pro-
18 cedure which follows in this subsection. In such case, the meeting chair-
19 man shall appoint a credentials committee to determine the number of votes
20 each water user present is authorized to cast. If requested, each person
21 present who owns or has the use for the ensuing season of any water right in
22 the stream or water supply comprising such water district that is assessed or
23 proposed to be assessed by such district, which right has been adjudicated
24 or decreed by the court or is represented by valid permit or license issued
25 by the department of water resources, shall be entitled to a number of votes
26 equal to the average annual dollar amount and any fraction thereof assessed
27 for that person's qualifying water right for the previous five (5) years, or
28 such lesser number of years as the right has been assessed. If a right has
29 not previously been assessed, a person present who owns or has the use of the
30 right for the ensuing season shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to
31 the dollar amount and any fraction thereof that the right would have been as-
32 sessed had it existed and been reasonably used when water was available under
33 the priority of the right during the previous season. Absentee voting and
34 voting by proxy are prohibited.
35 (5) At such meeting, the water users shall choose a meeting chairman and
36 meeting secretary. The water users of any water district that collects or
37 pays district expenses in accordance with section 42-613(3) or 42-619, Idaho
38 Code, shall also elect a water district treasurer. Within five (5) business
39 days after such meeting, the meeting chairman and meeting secretary shall
40 forward a certified copy of the minutes of such meeting to the department of
41 water resources. The meeting chairman, or the meeting secretary if the meet-
42 ing chairman is not present, from the immediately preceding annual meeting
43 shall call the meeting to order and preside over the election of officers for
44 the meeting.
45 (6) At such meeting, the water users may choose an advisory committee
46 to be composed of members selected as may be determined at the meeting, which
47 committee shall serve as advisors to the director and the watermaster in mat-
48 ters pertaining to the distribution of water within the district. The advi-
49 sory committee may be authorized to carry out policies as set forth in reso-
50 lutions duly adopted by the water users at the annual meeting or at a special

4
1 meeting. The advisory committee may also serve as the local committee to fa-
2 cilitate the rental of stored water if appointed by the water resource board
3 for such purpose under the provisions of section 42-1765, Idaho Code.
4 (7) A corporation or a water delivery organization, including but not
5 limited to a water company, an irrigation district, an irrigation company or
6 a canal company, shall be considered a person for the purpose of this section
7 and shall designate someone to cast its vote.
8 (8) Should said meeting not be held, or should said watermaster not be
9 elected or the watermaster's compensation not be fixed as above provided,
10 then the director is authorized to appoint a watermaster and fix the water-
11 master's compensation.
12 (9) The director may remove any watermaster whenever such watermaster
13 fails to perform the watermaster's duty, upon complaint made to the direc-
14 tor in writing, by one (1) person owning or having the right to the use of a
15 water right that is assessed by such district, which right has been adjudi-
16 cated or decreed by the court or is represented by valid permit or license is-
17 sued by the department of water resources, provided, that upon investigation
18 the director, after a hearing with the other water users of said district,
19 which shall be held in the district or at some location convenient to the wa-
20 ter users of the district, finds such charge to be true, and the director may
21 appoint a successor for the unexpired term.
22 (10) Before entering upon the duties of the watermaster's office, said
23 watermaster shall take and subscribe to an oath before some officer autho-
24 rized by the laws of the state to administer oaths, to faithfully perform
25 the duties of the watermaster's office, as provided in section 42-607, Idaho
26 Code, and shall file that oath with the department of water resources. Upon
27 appointment by the director, the actions taken by a watermaster in fulfill-
28 ment of the duties of the office are covered by the state group surety bond
29 as provided by sections 59-801 through 59-804, Idaho Code. A duly appointed
30 watermaster that is reelected in consecutive years shall not be required to
31 take and file additional oaths with the department of water resources for
32 each consecutive year the watermaster is reelected. If a duly elected or ap-
33 pointed watermaster resigns, dies or is physically unable to perform the du-
34 ties of the office during the remainder of the elected or appointed watermas-
35 ter term of service, then the director is authorized to appoint a successor
36 for the unexpired term as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsec-
37 tion.
38 (a) If a water district advisory committee has been chosen as provided
39 in subsection (6) of this section, the water district advisory commit-
40 tee shall meet to either nominate a successor watermaster or request a
41 special meeting as provided in subsection (11) of this section to elect
42 a new watermaster. Upon receipt of a nomination from a majority of the
43 members of the water district advisory committee, the director is au-
44 thorized to appoint the nominated successor watermaster for the unex-
45 pired term.
46 (b) If a water district advisory committee has not been chosen, the
47 director of the department of water resources is authorized to appoint
48 a temporary successor watermaster. The temporary appointment extends
49 through the unexpired term unless a special meeting is requested as

5
1 provided in subsection (11) of this section and water users elect a new
2 watermaster.
3 (11) The director shall call a special meeting of the water district
4 upon receipt of a written request for such meeting from a majority of the
5 members of the advisory committee for a district, a written request from
6 water users representing thirty percent (30%) or more of the votes cast at
7 the last regular annual meeting, a written request from the watermaster, or
8 on the director's own motion if the director determines a meeting is neces-
9 sary to address matters that cannot be delayed until the next regular annual
10 meeting. Notice of the time, place and purpose of the special meeting shall
11 be given by the director in the manner provided in subsection (2) of this sec-
12 tion, provided however, that a special meeting notice shall be sent at least
13 fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting date.
14 (12) The water users may, by resolution, authorize the watermaster to
15 acquire, hold and dispose of such real and personal property, equipment and
16 facilities in the name of the water district as necessary for the proper dis-
17 tribution of water, administration of the water district and enhancement of
18 water supplies and shall provide that all such real and personal property
19 shall remain in the custody of the watermaster and the watermaster's succes-
20 sor.
21 (13) The water users may, by resolution, authorize the watermaster to
22 develop, coordinate or provide, through contract or by other means, for
23 weather modification projects involving cloud seeding that are designed to
24 increase the water supplies of the water district by enhancing natural pre-
25 cipitation and which conform to state water planning objectives.
