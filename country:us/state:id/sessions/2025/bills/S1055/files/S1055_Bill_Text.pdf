10 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
11 ignated as Section 63-3643, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
12 63-3643. ELECTRONIC PAYMENT TRANSACTION INTERCHANGE FEES. (1) The
13 amount of a state or local tax and the amount of a gratuity that is calculated
14 as a percentage of an electronic payment transaction amount, if identified
15 or listed separately by the merchant on the payment invoice or other demand
16 for payment, must be excluded from the amount on which an interchange fee is
17 charged for that electronic payment transaction. Such taxes include but are
18 not limited to:
19 (a) Sales and use taxes under this chapter;
20 (b) Hotel and motel room sales taxes pursuant to sections 67-4917A
21 through 67-4917C, Idaho Code;
22 (c) Fuels taxes pursuant to chapter 24, title 63, Idaho Code; and
23 (d) Cigarette and tobacco products taxes pursuant to chapter 25, title
24 63, Idaho Code.
25 (2)(a) A payment card network shall either:
26 (i) Deduct the amount of any tax and gratuity imposed from the
27 calculation of interchange fees specific to each form or type of
28 electronic payment transaction at the time of settlement; or
29 (ii) Rebate an amount of interchange fee proportionate to the
30 amount attributable to the tax and gratuity.
31 (b) A deduction or rebate must occur at the time of settlement when the
32 merchant captures and transmits the tax and gratuity amounts relevant
33 to the sale at the time of sale as part of the transaction finalization.
34 If a merchant is unable to capture and transmit tax and gratuity amounts
35 relevant to the sale at the time of sale, the merchant may submit tax
36 and gratuity documentation to the payment card network no later than
37 one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the electronic payment
38 transaction. Within thirty (30) days after the merchant submits the
39 necessary tax and gratuity documentation, the issuer must credit to the
40 merchant the amount of interchange fees charged on the tax and gratuity
41 amount of the electronic payment transaction.

2
1 (3) This section creates no liability for a payment card network re-
2 garding the accuracy of the tax or gratuity amount reported by the merchant.
3 If a merchant chooses not to identify the tax or gratuity amounts, or both
4 tax and gratuity amounts, calculated as a percentage of an electronic pay-
5 ment transaction, the interchange fee may be charged on the full unsegre-
6 gated amount of the electronic payment transaction.
7 (4) It shall be unlawful for any person to alter or manipulate the com-
8 putation and imposition of interchange fees by increasing the rate or amount
9 of the fees applicable to or imposed upon the portion of a credit or debit
10 card transaction not attributable to taxes and gratuities charged to the re-
11 tailer in order to circumvent the effect of this section.

18 tronic payment transaction and the tax or gratuity amount, or both tax
19 and gratuity amounts, of the transaction. Tax and gratuity documenta-
20 tion may be related to a single electronic payment transaction or mul-
21 tiple electronic payment transactions aggregated over a period of time.
