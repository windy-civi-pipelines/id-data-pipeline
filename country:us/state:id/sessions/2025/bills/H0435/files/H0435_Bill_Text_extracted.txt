28 House Bill No. 354, if enacted by the First Regular Session of the Sixty-
29 eighth Idaho Legislature, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as fol-
30 lows:
31 63-208. RULES PERTAINING TO MARKET VALUE -- DUTY OF ASSESSORS. (1) It
32 shall be the duty of the state tax commission to prepare and distribute to
33 each county assessor and the county commissioners within the state of Idaho
34 rules prescribing and directing the manner in which market value for assess-
35 ment purposes is to be determined for the purpose of taxation. The rules
36 promulgated by the state tax commission shall require each assessor to find
37 market value for assessment purposes of all property, except that expressly
38 exempt under chapter 6, title 63, Idaho Code, within his county according to
39 recognized appraisal methods and techniques as set forth by the state tax
40 commission; provided, that the actual and functional use shall be a major
41 consideration when determining market value for assessment purposes. The
42 recognized appraisal methods shall, at a minimum, require the assessment
2
1 of such property to reflect, within reasonable statistical certainty, the
2 median ratio of assessed value to market value for the categories of prop-
3 erty being tested within a range of ninety percent (90%) ninety-five percent
4 (95%) to one hundred ten percent (110%) five percent (105%) of such median
5 ratio, using statistical methods such as confidence intervals to determine
6 compliance and requiring corrective actions if the ratio falls outside of
7 this range.
8 (2) To maximize uniformity and equity in assessment of different cat-
9 egories of property, such rules shall, to the extent practical, require the
10 use of reproduction or replacement cost less depreciation as opposed to his-
11 toric cost less depreciation whenever cost is considered as a single or one
12 (1) of several factors in establishing the market value of depreciable prop-
13 erty. The state tax commission shall also prepare and distribute amendments
14 and changes to the rules as shall be necessary in order to carry out the in-
15 tent and purposes of this title. The rules shall be in the form as the commis-
16 sion shall direct, and shall be made available upon request to other public
17 officers and the general public in reasonable quantities without charge. In
18 ascertaining the market value for assessment purposes of any item of prop-
19 erty, the assessor of each county shall, and is required to, abide by, adhere
20 to and conform with rules promulgated by the state tax commission.
21 (3) When establishing the real property market value for assessment
22 purposes of income-producing property, the assessor may use one (1) or more
23 market valuation methods, provided that the market value shall not include
24 contract rent related to the real estate only and shall exclude any value
25 of exempt intangible personal property as provided in section 63-602L,
26 Idaho Code. Upon request by the property owner, the assessor shall provide
27 the property owner with the assessor's calculations used to derive the in-
28 come-producing property owner's market value, including any value exempted
29 by statute.

31 of House Bill No. 40, as enacted by the First Regular Session of the Sixty-

2 amended to read as follows:
3 63-3045. NOTICE OF REDETERMINATION OR DEFICIENCY -- INTEREST.
4 (1)(a) If, in the case of any taxpayer, the state tax commission de-
5 termines that there is a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by
6 this title, the state tax commission shall, immediately upon discovery
7 thereof, send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by first class
8 mail or by other commercial delivery service providing proof of deliv-
9 ery, whichever is the most cost-efficient. The notice shall be sent
10 to the taxpayer's last address known to the state tax commission. The
11 notice of deficiency shall be accompanied by an explanation of the spe-
12 cific reason for the determination and an explanation of the taxpayer's
13 right to appeal. Within sixty-three (63) days after such notice is
14 mailed, the taxpayer may, at his option, file a protest in writing with
15 the state tax commission and obtain redetermination of the deficiency.
16 (b) If the taxpayer files a protest with the state tax commission within
17 the period set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, and such
18 protest does not comply with the rules of the state tax commission and
19 is therefore inadequate to perfect the taxpayer's right to a redetermi-
20 nation of the deficiency determination, then the state tax commission
21 shall notify the taxpayer, in the same manner as set forth in paragraph
22 (a) of this subsection, of such inadequacies, setting forth in said
23 notice the corrective action to be taken by the taxpayer to perfect his
24 protest. The taxpayer shall thereafter have twenty-eight (28) days
25 from the date of said notice to perfect his protest.
26 (c) No assessment of a deficiency in respect to the tax imposed by this
27 chapter, and no distraint or proceedings in court for its collection,
28 shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed
29 to the taxpayer, nor until all appeal rights relating to the deficiency
30 have become final.
31 (2)(a) Following a perfected protest, the taxpayer has the right to
32 an independent administrative redetermination of the originating di-
33 vision's determination before the state tax commission, including a
34 hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to discuss the deficiency de-
35 termination and the taxpayer's protest with a commissioner or duly
36 authorized representative of the commission. The meeting shall be
37 held informally and evidence shall be freely admitted regardless of the
38 rules of evidence.
39 (b) Tax commission staff assigned to the administrative redetermi-
40 nation may not engage in communications relating to the taxpayer's
41 protest with employees of the originating division without first
42 providing the taxpayer the opportunity to participate, except for ques-
43 tions that involve ministerial, administrative or procedural matters
44 that do not address the substance of the issues or positions taken in the
45 case or as otherwise allowed under title 63, Idaho Code, and the rules
46 promulgated thereunder. The state tax commission shall promulgate
47 rules governing communications with the originating division to ensure
48 an independent review process. The provisions of this subsection do
49 not create a substantive right affecting the taxpayer's tax liability
8
1 or the state tax commission's ability to determine, assess or collect
2 that tax liability, including statutory interest and any penalties, if
3 applicable.
4 (3) Any hearing conducted under the provisions of this section may
5 be conducted, in whole or in part, by telephone, television, or other
6 electronic means if each participant in the hearing has an opportunity to
7 participate in the entire proceeding while it is taking place.
8 (4) A taxpayer has the right to be represented by, or be accompanied by,
9 any person of his choice in any proceeding before the tax commission. If the
10 taxpayer is not present at a proceeding, the representative of that taxpayer
11 must be designated in writing by the taxpayer as shall be prescribed in ad-
12 ministrative rules or in any manner acceptable to the tax commission.
13 (5) Following a perfected protest, the taxpayer may submit additional
14 evidence or documentation during the redetermination process subject to the
15 provisions of section 63-3045B(3)(a), Idaho Code.
16 (6) If the taxpayer does not file a protest with the state tax commis-
17 sion within the time prescribed in subsection (1)(a) of this section, the de-
18 ficiency shall be assessed and shall become due and payable upon notice and
19 demand from the state tax commission.
20 (7)(a) Interest shall apply to deficiencies in tax and refunds of tax.
21 Interest shall not apply to any penalty or to unpaid accrued interest.
22 Interest relating to deficiencies or refunds accruing after the origi-
23 nal due date of the return, but not including extensions of the due date,
24 shall be computed on the net of any underpayments and overpayments of a
25 tax liability required to be shown as due on the same return. Interest
26 on deficiencies shall not accrue for any period beginning on the date on
27 which the state tax commission sends written notice that an audit is be-
28 ing initiated identifies a return for possible audit until the date of
29 the issuance of a notice of deficiency determination. Nor shall inter-
30 est on deficiencies accrue for any period between the issuance of a no-
31 tice of deficiency determination that is subject to a perfected protest
32 and the final determination of the deficiency by the state tax commis-
33 sion following the state tax commission's disposition of the protest.
34 (b) Interest upon any deficiency shall be assessed at the same time as
35 the deficiency, shall be due and payable upon notice and demand from
36 the state tax commission and shall be collected as a part of the tax at
37 the rate per annum determined under the provisions of paragraph (c) of
38 this subsection from the date prescribed for the payment of the tax.
39 In the event any of the deficiency is reduced by reason of a carryback
40 of a net operating loss or a capital loss carryback, such reduction in
41 deficiency shall not affect the computation of interest under this sub-
42 section for the period ending with the last day of the taxable year in
43 which the net operating loss or capital loss arises.
44 (c) The rate of interest accruing during any calendar year, or portion
45 thereof, upon any deficiency, or payable upon an overpayment or re-
46 fund, shall be two percent (2%) plus the rate determined under section
47 1274(d), Internal Revenue Code, by the secretary of the treasury of the
48 United States as the midterm federal rate as it applies on September 15
49 of the immediately preceding calendar year rounded to the nearest whole
50 number.

2 the provisions of section 63-4208, Idaho Code, relating to the assessment of
3 taxes on illegal possession of controlled substances, the provisions of sec-
4 tion 63-4208, Idaho Code, shall prevail.

12 turn was filed, whichever is later.

14 such tax shall be collected either by levy, or by a proceeding brought in
15 court, within a period of twelve (12) years from the date of entry of the
16 record of assessment required by section 63-3045A, Idaho Code, of the tax and
17 provided, further, that this shall not be in derogation of any of the reme-
18 dies elsewhere provided in this chapter.
19 (c) In the case of a fraudulent return or a false return with the intent
20 to evade the tax imposed in this chapter, or a willful attempt in any manner
21 to defeat or evade the tax imposed in this chapter, a notice of deficiency may
22 be issued, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for collection of
23 such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time.
24 (d) In the case of a failure to file a return, for any reason, a notice
25 of deficiency may be issued, the tax imposed in this chapter may be assessed,
26 or a proceeding in court for collection of such tax may be begun without as-
27 sessment, at any time, unless the taxpayer had a reasonable belief that no
28 return was required to be filed under this chapter, in which case any defi-
29 ciency, assessment, or proceeding for collection of such tax shall be com-
30 menced within three (3) years of the time the return was due.
31 (e) In the case of income received during the lifetime of a decedent,
32 or by his estate during the period of administration, a notice of deficiency
33 shall be issued, a claim shall be made, the tax shall be assessed or any pro-
34 ceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such tax shall be
35 begun, within twelve (12) months after written request for prompt action is
36 filed with the state tax commission by the executor, administrator, or other
37 fiduciary representing the estate of such decedent. This subsection shall
38 not apply if the return for which the request for prompt action relates has
39 not been filed with the state tax commission.
40 (f) When Idaho taxable income or tax credits for any taxable year have
41 been adjusted as a result of a final federal determination, the period of
42 limitation for issuing a notice of deficiency shall be reopened and shall not
43 expire until the later of one (1) year from the date of delivery of the fi-
44 nal federal determination to the state tax commission by the taxpayer, three
45 (3) years from the due date of the return, without regard to extensions, or
46 three (3) years from the date the return was filed. For purposes of this sub-
47 section the term "final federal determination" shall mean the final resolu-
48 tion of all issues which were adjusted by the internal revenue service. When
49 the final federal determination is submitted, the taxpayer shall also submit
10
1 copies of all schedules and written explanations provided by the internal
2 revenue service. Upon the expiration of the period of limitations as pro-
3 vided in subsections (a) and (m) of this section, only those specific items
4 of income, deductions, gains, losses, or credits which were adjusted in the
5 final federal determination shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of
6 recomputing Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the ef-
7 fect of such adjustments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.
8 (g) If an adjustment, which was made within the period of limitations
9 as provided in this section, affects the amount of tax credit, net operating
10 loss, or capital loss, claimed in a taxable year other than the tax year in
11 which the adjustment is made, then adjustments to the credit, net operating
12 loss, or capital loss claimed in such other tax year may be made and a result-
13 ing notice of deficiency may be issued even though such notice of deficiency
14 would otherwise be barred under the provisions of this section.
15 (h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, when an
16 amended Idaho return is filed within the period of limitations as provided in
17 subsections (a) and (m) of this section, the period of limitations for issu-
18 ing a notice of deficiency shall be three (3) years from the date the amended
19 return was filed. However, upon the expiration of the period of limitations
20 as provided in subsections (a) and (m) of this section, only those specific
21 items of income, deductions, gains, losses, or credits, which were adjusted
22 in the amended Idaho return shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of
23 recomputing Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the ef-
24 fect of such adjustments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.
25 (i) If a taxpayer has filed an amended federal return, and no corre-
26 sponding Idaho amended return has been filed with the state tax commission,
27 then the period of limitations for issuing a notice of deficiency shall be
28 reopened and shall not expire until three (3) years from the date of deliv-
29 ery to the tax commission by the taxpayer of the amended federal return. How-
30 ever, upon the expiration of the period of limitations as provided in subsec-
31 tions (a) and (m) of this section, then only those specific items of income,
32 deductions, gains, losses, or credits, which were adjusted in the amended
33 federal return shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of recomputing
34 Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the effect of such ad-
35 justments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.
36 (j) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, a notice of
37 deficiency, related to items on the return of any pass-through entity, as de-
38 fined in this section, which other taxpayers are required by law to report,
39 shall be issued to such other taxpayers within the later of three (3) years
40 from the due date of the other taxpayers' return, without regard to exten-
41 sions, three (3) years from the date the other taxpayers' returns were filed,
42 or three (3) years from the date of filing of the pass-through entity's re-
43 turn. If the pass-through entity files an amended return, notices of defi-
44 ciency may be issued to the other taxpayers within three (3) years from the
45 date the amended return for the pass-through entity was filed with the state
46 tax commission. If the pass-through entity files an amended return with the
47 internal revenue service, or the internal revenue service issues a final de-
48 termination to the pass-through entity, then the period of limitations for
49 issuing a notice of deficiency to the other taxpayers shall be reopened and
50 shall not expire until three (3) years from the date of delivery to the tax
11
1 commission by the pass-through entity of the amended federal return or the
2 later of one (1) year from the date of delivery to the state tax commission by
3 the pass-through entity of the final federal determination, three (3) years
4 from the due date of the pass-through entity's return, without regard to ex-
5 tensions, or three (3) years from the date the pass-through entity's return
6 was filed.
7 (k) For purposes of this section, "pass-through entity" means a part-
8 nership, S corporation, trust, limited liability company or any other en-
9 tity whose items of income, deductions, gains, losses and credits must be re-
10 ported by other taxpayer(s). For further purposes of this section, the term
11 "other taxpayer" shall include, by way of unlimiting example, such taxpayers
12 as partners, shareholders, beneficiaries, joint venturers or investors.
13 (l) In the case of a duplicate return filed under section 63-217(1)(b),
14 Idaho Code, the limitation under this section shall be the later of one (1)
15 year from the filing of the duplicate return or the date otherwise applicable
16 under this section.
17 (m) Prior to the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for
18 the issuance of a notice of deficiency for the tax imposed in this chapter,
19 both the state tax commission, its delegate or deputy, and the taxpayer may
20 consent in writing to extend the period of time within which a notice of defi-
21 ciency may be issued. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent
22 agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously
23 agreed upon. When a pass-through entity extends the period of limitations
24 in accordance with this subsection, the period of limitations for the other
25 taxpayers is automatically extended for the same period for the purpose of
26 issuing a notice of deficiency to the other taxpayers reflecting the adjust-
27 ments to the pass-through entity's return.
28 (n) The expiration of the period of limitations as provided in this sec-
29 tion shall be suspended for the time period during which the state tax com-
30 mission is prohibited from issuing a notice of deficiency, making the as-
31 sessment, or from collecting by levy or a proceeding in court, and for thirty
32 (30) days thereafter.
33 (o) For the purposes of this section, "return" includes a notice of de-
34 ficiency determination issued by the state tax commission when no return was
35 filed by the taxpayer. Such a return is deemed filed on the date the taxes de-
36 termined by the state tax commission are assessed.

15 tion amounts. The state tax commission shall calculate the per
16 capita distribution for each city resulting from the previous fis-
17 cal year's distributions.

25 1. If the distributions made to the cities during the same
26 quarter of the previous fiscal year were below the base
27 amount established in fiscal year 2020, then the various
28 cities shall first receive a proportional increase up to the
29 base amount for each city and up to a one-percent (1%) in-
30 crease over such base amount. Any remaining moneys shall be

36 quarter of the previous fiscal year were at or above the

26 county's payment shall be reduced proportionately.
27 3. If the dollar amount of money available under this sub-
28 section (10)(b)(ii) in any quarter exceeds the amount paid
29 in the fourth quarter of calendar year 1999, each county
30 shall be entitled to a proportionately increased payment,
31 but such increase shall not exceed one hundred five percent
32 (105%) of the total payment made in the fourth quarter of
33 calendar year 1999.

37 ter of calendar year 1999, any amount over and above such
38 one hundred five percent (105%) shall be paid to the various

2 district's payment shall be reduced proportionately.
3 (iii) If the dollar amount of money available under this subsec-
4 tion (10)(c) in any quarter exceeds the amount distributed under
5 paragraph (c)(i) of this subsection, each special purpose taxing
6 district shall be entitled to a share of the excess based on the
7 proportion each such district's current property tax budget bears
8 to the sum of the current property tax budgets of all such dis-
9 tricts in the state. Each year, starting with the distribution
10 for the quarter ending December 31, the state tax commission shall
11 calculate this distribution based on the district's current prop-
12 erty tax budgets, including any unrecovered forgone amounts as de-
13 termined under section 63-802(1)(e), Idaho Code. When a special

26 tion. The board of county commissioners shall determine any re-
27 distribution of moneys so received.
28 (vi) Taxing districts formed after January 1, 2001, are not en-
29 titled to a payment under the provisions of this paragraph (c) of
30 this subsection.

39 ginning in October 2001 for replacement of property tax on farm machinery and
40 equipment exempted pursuant to section 63-602EE, Idaho Code. For nonschool
41 districts, the state tax commission shall distribute one-fourth (1/4) of
42 this amount certified quarterly to each county. For school districts, the
43 state tax commission shall distribute one-fourth (1/4) of the amount cer-
44 tified quarterly to each school district. For nonschool districts, the
45 county auditor shall distribute such amounts to each district within thirty
46 (30) calendar days from receipt of moneys from the state tax commission.
47 Moneys received by each taxing district for replacement shall be utilized
48 in the same manner and in the same proportions as revenues from property
49 taxation. The moneys remitted to the county treasurer for replacement of
50 property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602EE, Idaho Code, may
16
1 be considered by the counties and other taxing districts and budgeted at the
2 same time, in the same manner, and in the same year as revenues from taxation
3 on personal property, which these moneys replace. If taxing districts are
4 consolidated, the resulting district is entitled to an amount equal to the
5 sum of the amounts received in the last calendar quarter by each district
6 pursuant to this subsection prior to the consolidation. If a taxing district
7 is dissolved or disincorporated, the state tax commission shall continu-
8 ously distribute to the board of county commissioners an amount equal to the
9 last quarter's distribution prior to dissolution or disincorporation. The
10 board of county commissioners shall determine any redistribution of moneys
11 so received. If a taxing district annexes territory, the distribution of
12 moneys received pursuant to this subsection shall be unaffected. Taxing
13 districts formed after January 1, 2001, are not entitled to a payment under
14 the provisions of this subsection. School districts shall receive an amount

17 property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602EE, Idaho Code, pro-
18 vided that the result of these calculations shall not be less than zero (0).
19 The result of these school district calculations shall be further increased
20 by six percent (6%). For purposes of the limitation provided by section

31 propriated unless the legislature enacts a different appropriation for a
32 particular fiscal year. For purposes of the limitation provided by section
33 63-802, Idaho Code, moneys received pursuant to this section as property tax
34 replacement for property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602KK,
35 Idaho Code, shall be treated as property tax revenues. If taxing districts
36 are consolidated, the resulting district is entitled to an amount equal to
37 the sum of the amounts that were received in the last calendar year by each
38 district pursuant to this subsection prior to the consolidation. If a taxing
39 district or revenue allocation area annexes territory, the distribution of
40 moneys received pursuant to this subsection shall be unaffected. Taxing
41 districts and revenue allocation areas formed after January 1, 2022, are not
42 entitled to a payment under the provisions of this subsection.
43 (14) For fiscal year 2023 only, a sum of thirty-four million dollars
44 ($34,000,000) shall be distributed each year by the state tax commission to
45 the forty-four (44) counties in the proportion that the expenditures of each

27 SECTION 1. That Section 63-208, Idaho Code, as amended in Section 1 of
28 House Bill No. 354, if enacted by the First Regular Session of the Sixty-
29 eighth Idaho Legislature, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as fol-
30 lows:
31 63-208. RULES PERTAINING TO MARKET VALUE -- DUTY OF ASSESSORS. (1) It
32 shall be the duty of the state tax commission to prepare and distribute to
33 each county assessor and the county commissioners within the state of Idaho
34 rules prescribing and directing the manner in which market value for assess-
35 ment purposes is to be determined for the purpose of taxation. The rules
36 promulgated by the state tax commission shall require each assessor to find
37 market value for assessment purposes of all property, except that expressly
38 exempt under chapter 6, title 63, Idaho Code, within his county according to
39 recognized appraisal methods and techniques as set forth by the state tax
40 commission; provided, that the actual and functional use shall be a major
41 consideration when determining market value for assessment purposes. The
42 recognized appraisal methods shall, at a minimum, require the assessment

2
1 of such property to reflect, within reasonable statistical certainty, the
2 median ratio of assessed value to market value for the categories of prop-
3 erty being tested within a range of ninety percent (90%) ninety-five percent
4 (95%) to one hundred ten percent (110%) five percent (105%) of such median
5 ratio, using statistical methods such as confidence intervals to determine
6 compliance and requiring corrective actions if the ratio falls outside of
7 this range.
8 (2) To maximize uniformity and equity in assessment of different cat-
9 egories of property, such rules shall, to the extent practical, require the
10 use of reproduction or replacement cost less depreciation as opposed to his-
11 toric cost less depreciation whenever cost is considered as a single or one
12 (1) of several factors in establishing the market value of depreciable prop-
13 erty. The state tax commission shall also prepare and distribute amendments
14 and changes to the rules as shall be necessary in order to carry out the in-
15 tent and purposes of this title. The rules shall be in the form as the commis-
16 sion shall direct, and shall be made available upon request to other public
17 officers and the general public in reasonable quantities without charge. In
18 ascertaining the market value for assessment purposes of any item of prop-
19 erty, the assessor of each county shall, and is required to, abide by, adhere
20 to and conform with rules promulgated by the state tax commission.
21 (3) When establishing the real property market value for assessment
22 purposes of income-producing property, the assessor may use one (1) or more
23 market valuation methods, provided that the market value shall not include
24 contract rent related to the real estate only and shall exclude any value
25 of exempt intangible personal property as provided in section 63-602L,
26 Idaho Code. Upon request by the property owner, the assessor shall provide
27 the property owner with the assessor's calculations used to derive the in-
28 come-producing property owner's market value, including any value exempted
29 by statute.

18 protest does not comply with the rules of the state tax commission and
19 is therefore inadequate to perfect the taxpayer's right to a redetermi-
20 nation of the deficiency determination, then the state tax commission
21 shall notify the taxpayer, in the same manner as set forth in paragraph
22 (a) of this subsection, of such inadequacies, setting forth in said
23 notice the corrective action to be taken by the taxpayer to perfect his
24 protest. The taxpayer shall thereafter have twenty-eight (28) days
25 from the date of said notice to perfect his protest.
26 (c) No assessment of a deficiency in respect to the tax imposed by this
27 chapter, and no distraint or proceedings in court for its collection,
28 shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed
29 to the taxpayer, nor until all appeal rights relating to the deficiency
30 have become final.
31 (2)(a) Following a perfected protest, the taxpayer has the right to
32 an independent administrative redetermination of the originating di-
33 vision's determination before the state tax commission, including a
34 hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to discuss the deficiency de-
35 termination and the taxpayer's protest with a commissioner or duly
36 authorized representative of the commission. The meeting shall be
37 held informally and evidence shall be freely admitted regardless of the
38 rules of evidence.
39 (b) Tax commission staff assigned to the administrative redetermi-
40 nation may not engage in communications relating to the taxpayer's
41 protest with employees of the originating division without first
42 providing the taxpayer the opportunity to participate, except for ques-
43 tions that involve ministerial, administrative or procedural matters
44 that do not address the substance of the issues or positions taken in the
45 case or as otherwise allowed under title 63, Idaho Code, and the rules
46 promulgated thereunder. The state tax commission shall promulgate
47 rules governing communications with the originating division to ensure
48 an independent review process. The provisions of this subsection do
49 not create a substantive right affecting the taxpayer's tax liability

8
1 or the state tax commission's ability to determine, assess or collect
2 that tax liability, including statutory interest and any penalties, if
3 applicable.
4 (3) Any hearing conducted under the provisions of this section may
5 be conducted, in whole or in part, by telephone, television, or other
6 electronic means if each participant in the hearing has an opportunity to
7 participate in the entire proceeding while it is taking place.
8 (4) A taxpayer has the right to be represented by, or be accompanied by,
9 any person of his choice in any proceeding before the tax commission. If the
10 taxpayer is not present at a proceeding, the representative of that taxpayer
11 must be designated in writing by the taxpayer as shall be prescribed in ad-
12 ministrative rules or in any manner acceptable to the tax commission.
13 (5) Following a perfected protest, the taxpayer may submit additional
14 evidence or documentation during the redetermination process subject to the
15 provisions of section 63-3045B(3)(a), Idaho Code.
16 (6) If the taxpayer does not file a protest with the state tax commis-
17 sion within the time prescribed in subsection (1)(a) of this section, the de-
18 ficiency shall be assessed and shall become due and payable upon notice and
19 demand from the state tax commission.
20 (7)(a) Interest shall apply to deficiencies in tax and refunds of tax.
21 Interest shall not apply to any penalty or to unpaid accrued interest.
22 Interest relating to deficiencies or refunds accruing after the origi-
23 nal due date of the return, but not including extensions of the due date,
24 shall be computed on the net of any underpayments and overpayments of a
25 tax liability required to be shown as due on the same return. Interest
26 on deficiencies shall not accrue for any period beginning on the date on
27 which the state tax commission sends written notice that an audit is be-
28 ing initiated identifies a return for possible audit until the date of
29 the issuance of a notice of deficiency determination. Nor shall inter-
30 est on deficiencies accrue for any period between the issuance of a no-
31 tice of deficiency determination that is subject to a perfected protest
32 and the final determination of the deficiency by the state tax commis-
33 sion following the state tax commission's disposition of the protest.
34 (b) Interest upon any deficiency shall be assessed at the same time as
35 the deficiency, shall be due and payable upon notice and demand from
36 the state tax commission and shall be collected as a part of the tax at
37 the rate per annum determined under the provisions of paragraph (c) of
38 this subsection from the date prescribed for the payment of the tax.
39 In the event any of the deficiency is reduced by reason of a carryback
40 of a net operating loss or a capital loss carryback, such reduction in
41 deficiency shall not affect the computation of interest under this sub-
42 section for the period ending with the last day of the taxable year in
43 which the net operating loss or capital loss arises.
44 (c) The rate of interest accruing during any calendar year, or portion
45 thereof, upon any deficiency, or payable upon an overpayment or re-
46 fund, shall be two percent (2%) plus the rate determined under section
47 1274(d), Internal Revenue Code, by the secretary of the treasury of the
48 United States as the midterm federal rate as it applies on September 15
49 of the immediately preceding calendar year rounded to the nearest whole
50 number.

1 (8) When the time provisions contained in this section conflict with
2 the provisions of section 63-4208, Idaho Code, relating to the assessment of
3 taxes on illegal possession of controlled substances, the provisions of sec-
4 tion 63-4208, Idaho Code, shall prevail.
5 SECTION 6. That Section 63-3068, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
6 amended to read as follows:
7 63-3068. PERIOD OF LIMITATIONS FOR ISSUING A NOTICE OF DEFICIENCY AND
8 COLLECTION OF TAX. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a notice
9 of deficiency, as provided in section 63-3045, Idaho Code, for the tax im-
10 posed in this chapter shall be issued within three (3) years from either the
11 due date of the return, without regard to extensions, or from the date the re-
12 turn was filed, whichever is later.
13 (b) If an assessment has been made as provided in this chapter, then
14 such tax shall be collected either by levy, or by a proceeding brought in
15 court, within a period of twelve (12) years from the date of entry of the
16 record of assessment required by section 63-3045A, Idaho Code, of the tax and
17 provided, further, that this shall not be in derogation of any of the reme-
18 dies elsewhere provided in this chapter.
19 (c) In the case of a fraudulent return or a false return with the intent
20 to evade the tax imposed in this chapter, or a willful attempt in any manner
21 to defeat or evade the tax imposed in this chapter, a notice of deficiency may
22 be issued, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for collection of
23 such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time.
24 (d) In the case of a failure to file a return, for any reason, a notice
25 of deficiency may be issued, the tax imposed in this chapter may be assessed,
26 or a proceeding in court for collection of such tax may be begun without as-
27 sessment, at any time, unless the taxpayer had a reasonable belief that no
28 return was required to be filed under this chapter, in which case any defi-
29 ciency, assessment, or proceeding for collection of such tax shall be com-
30 menced within three (3) years of the time the return was due.
31 (e) In the case of income received during the lifetime of a decedent,
32 or by his estate during the period of administration, a notice of deficiency
33 shall be issued, a claim shall be made, the tax shall be assessed or any pro-
34 ceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such tax shall be
35 begun, within twelve (12) months after written request for prompt action is
36 filed with the state tax commission by the executor, administrator, or other
37 fiduciary representing the estate of such decedent. This subsection shall
38 not apply if the return for which the request for prompt action relates has
39 not been filed with the state tax commission.
40 (f) When Idaho taxable income or tax credits for any taxable year have
41 been adjusted as a result of a final federal determination, the period of
42 limitation for issuing a notice of deficiency shall be reopened and shall not
43 expire until the later of one (1) year from the date of delivery of the fi-
44 nal federal determination to the state tax commission by the taxpayer, three
45 (3) years from the due date of the return, without regard to extensions, or
46 three (3) years from the date the return was filed. For purposes of this sub-
47 section the term "final federal determination" shall mean the final resolu-
48 tion of all issues which were adjusted by the internal revenue service. When
49 the final federal determination is submitted, the taxpayer shall also submit

10
1 copies of all schedules and written explanations provided by the internal
2 revenue service. Upon the expiration of the period of limitations as pro-
3 vided in subsections (a) and (m) of this section, only those specific items
4 of income, deductions, gains, losses, or credits which were adjusted in the
5 final federal determination shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of
6 recomputing Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the ef-
7 fect of such adjustments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.
8 (g) If an adjustment, which was made within the period of limitations
9 as provided in this section, affects the amount of tax credit, net operating
10 loss, or capital loss, claimed in a taxable year other than the tax year in
11 which the adjustment is made, then adjustments to the credit, net operating
12 loss, or capital loss claimed in such other tax year may be made and a result-
13 ing notice of deficiency may be issued even though such notice of deficiency
14 would otherwise be barred under the provisions of this section.
15 (h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, when an
16 amended Idaho return is filed within the period of limitations as provided in
17 subsections (a) and (m) of this section, the period of limitations for issu-
18 ing a notice of deficiency shall be three (3) years from the date the amended
19 return was filed. However, upon the expiration of the period of limitations
20 as provided in subsections (a) and (m) of this section, only those specific
21 items of income, deductions, gains, losses, or credits, which were adjusted
22 in the amended Idaho return shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of
23 recomputing Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the ef-
24 fect of such adjustments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.
25 (i) If a taxpayer has filed an amended federal return, and no corre-
26 sponding Idaho amended return has been filed with the state tax commission,
27 then the period of limitations for issuing a notice of deficiency shall be
28 reopened and shall not expire until three (3) years from the date of deliv-
29 ery to the tax commission by the taxpayer of the amended federal return. How-
30 ever, upon the expiration of the period of limitations as provided in subsec-
31 tions (a) and (m) of this section, then only those specific items of income,
32 deductions, gains, losses, or credits, which were adjusted in the amended
33 federal return shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of recomputing
34 Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the effect of such ad-
35 justments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.
36 (j) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, a notice of
37 deficiency, related to items on the return of any pass-through entity, as de-
38 fined in this section, which other taxpayers are required by law to report,
39 shall be issued to such other taxpayers within the later of three (3) years
40 from the due date of the other taxpayers' return, without regard to exten-
41 sions, three (3) years from the date the other taxpayers' returns were filed,
42 or three (3) years from the date of filing of the pass-through entity's re-
43 turn. If the pass-through entity files an amended return, notices of defi-
44 ciency may be issued to the other taxpayers within three (3) years from the
45 date the amended return for the pass-through entity was filed with the state
46 tax commission. If the pass-through entity files an amended return with the
47 internal revenue service, or the internal revenue service issues a final de-
48 termination to the pass-through entity, then the period of limitations for
49 issuing a notice of deficiency to the other taxpayers shall be reopened and
50 shall not expire until three (3) years from the date of delivery to the tax

11
1 commission by the pass-through entity of the amended federal return or the
2 later of one (1) year from the date of delivery to the state tax commission by
3 the pass-through entity of the final federal determination, three (3) years
4 from the due date of the pass-through entity's return, without regard to ex-
5 tensions, or three (3) years from the date the pass-through entity's return
6 was filed.
7 (k) For purposes of this section, "pass-through entity" means a part-
8 nership, S corporation, trust, limited liability company or any other en-
9 tity whose items of income, deductions, gains, losses and credits must be re-
10 ported by other taxpayer(s). For further purposes of this section, the term
11 "other taxpayer" shall include, by way of unlimiting example, such taxpayers
12 as partners, shareholders, beneficiaries, joint venturers or investors.
13 (l) In the case of a duplicate return filed under section 63-217(1)(b),
14 Idaho Code, the limitation under this section shall be the later of one (1)
15 year from the filing of the duplicate return or the date otherwise applicable
16 under this section.
17 (m) Prior to the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for
18 the issuance of a notice of deficiency for the tax imposed in this chapter,
19 both the state tax commission, its delegate or deputy, and the taxpayer may
20 consent in writing to extend the period of time within which a notice of defi-
21 ciency may be issued. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent
22 agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously
23 agreed upon. When a pass-through entity extends the period of limitations
24 in accordance with this subsection, the period of limitations for the other
25 taxpayers is automatically extended for the same period for the purpose of
26 issuing a notice of deficiency to the other taxpayers reflecting the adjust-
27 ments to the pass-through entity's return.
28 (n) The expiration of the period of limitations as provided in this sec-
29 tion shall be suspended for the time period during which the state tax com-
30 mission is prohibited from issuing a notice of deficiency, making the as-
31 sessment, or from collecting by levy or a proceeding in court, and for thirty
32 (30) days thereafter.
33 (o) For the purposes of this section, "return" includes a notice of de-
34 ficiency determination issued by the state tax commission when no return was
35 filed by the taxpayer. Such a return is deemed filed on the date the taxes de-
36 termined by the state tax commission are assessed.

38 amended to read as follows:

36 justment required in this section shall be distributed to each county in the
37 proportion that the population of the county bears to the population of the
38 state. Each county shall establish a special election fund to which shall
39 be deposited all revenues received from the distribution pursuant to this
40 subsection. All such revenues shall be used exclusively to defray the costs
41 associated with conducting elections as required of county clerks by the
42 provisions of section 34-1401, Idaho Code.
43 (9) One dollar ($1.00) on each application for certificate of title
44 or initial application for registration of a motor vehicle, snowmobile,

10 (a) Forty-five and two-tenths percent (45.2%) shall be paid to the var-
11 ious cities as follows:
12 (i) The revenue-sharing amount calculated by the state tax com-
13 mission for the various cities for each quarter of fiscal year 2020
14 shall be the base amount for current quarterly revenue distribu-
15 tion amounts. The state tax commission shall calculate the per
16 capita distribution for each city resulting from the previous fis-
17 cal year's distributions.
18 (ii) If there is no change in the amount of the revenue-sharing
19 account from the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, then the
20 various cities shall receive the same amount received for the same

23 rent quarter is greater than the balance of the revenue-sharing
24 account for the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, then:
25 1. If the distributions made to the cities during the same
26 quarter of the previous fiscal year were below the base
27 amount established in fiscal year 2020, then the various
28 cities shall first receive a proportional increase up to the
29 base amount for each city and up to a one-percent (1%) in-
30 crease over such base amount. Any remaining moneys shall be
31 distributed to cities with a below-average per capita dis-
32 tribution in the proportion that the population of that city
33 bears to the population of all cities with below-average per
34 capita distributions within the state.
35 2. If the distributions made to the cities during the same
36 quarter of the previous fiscal year were at or above the
37 base amount established in fiscal year 2020, then the cities
38 shall receive the same distribution they received during the
39 same quarter of the previous fiscal year plus a proportional

46 rent quarter is less than the balance of the revenue-sharing ac-
47 count for the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, then the
48 cities shall first receive a proportional reduction down to the
49 base amount established in fiscal year 2020. If further reduc-
50 tions are necessary, the cities shall receive reductions based on

14
1 the proportion that each city's population bears to the population
2 of all cities within the state.
3 (b) Forty-seven and one-tenth percent (47.1%) shall be paid to the var-
4 ious counties as follows:
5 (i) Fifty-nine and eight-tenths percent (59.8%) of the amount to

12 counties, and each county shall be entitled to an amount in
13 the proportion that the population of that county bears to
14 the population of the state; and

17 tributed as follows:
18 1. Each county that received a payment under the provisions
19 of section 63-3638(e), Idaho Code, as that subsection ex-
20 isted immediately prior to July 1, 2000, during the fourth
21 quarter of calendar year 1999, shall be entitled to a like
22 amount during succeeding calendar quarters.
23 2. If the dollar amount of money available under this sub-
24 section (10)(b)(ii) in any quarter does not equal the amount
25 paid in the fourth quarter of calendar year 1999, each
26 county's payment shall be reduced proportionately.
27 3. If the dollar amount of money available under this sub-
28 section (10)(b)(ii) in any quarter exceeds the amount paid
29 in the fourth quarter of calendar year 1999, each county
30 shall be entitled to a proportionately increased payment,
31 but such increase shall not exceed one hundred five percent
32 (105%) of the total payment made in the fourth quarter of
33 calendar year 1999.
34 4. If the dollar amount of money available under this sub-
35 section (10)(b)(ii) in any quarter exceeds one hundred five
36 percent (105%) of the total payment made in the fourth quar-
37 ter of calendar year 1999, any amount over and above such
38 one hundred five percent (105%) shall be paid to the various
39 counties in the proportion that the population of the county
40 bears to the population of the state; and
41 (c) Seven and seven-tenths percent (7.7%) of the amount appropriated in
42 this subsection shall be paid to the several counties for distribution
43 to special purpose taxing districts as follows:
44 (i) Each such district that received a payment under the provi-
45 sions of section 63-3638(e), Idaho Code, as such subsection ex-
46 isted immediately prior to July 1, 2000, during the fourth quarter
47 of calendar year 1999, shall be entitled to a like amount during
48 succeeding calendar quarters.
49 (ii) If the dollar amount of money available under this subsec-
50 tion (10)(c) in any quarter does not equal the amount paid in the

15
1 fourth quarter of calendar year 1999, each special purpose taxing
2 district's payment shall be reduced proportionately.
3 (iii) If the dollar amount of money available under this subsec-
4 tion (10)(c) in any quarter exceeds the amount distributed under
5 paragraph (c)(i) of this subsection, each special purpose taxing
6 district shall be entitled to a share of the excess based on the
7 proportion each such district's current property tax budget bears
8 to the sum of the current property tax budgets of all such dis-
9 tricts in the state. Each year, starting with the distribution
10 for the quarter ending December 31, the state tax commission shall
11 calculate this distribution based on the district's current prop-
12 erty tax budgets, including any unrecovered forgone amounts as de-
13 termined under section 63-802(1)(e), Idaho Code. When a special
14 purpose taxing district is situated in more than one (1) county,
15 the state tax commission shall determine the portion attributable
16 to the special purpose taxing district from each county in which it
17 is situated.
18 (iv) If special purpose taxing districts are consolidated, the
19 resulting district is entitled to a base amount equal to the sum of
20 the base amounts received in the last calendar quarter by each dis-
21 trict prior to the consolidation.
22 (v) If a special purpose taxing district is dissolved or disin-
23 corporated, the state tax commission shall continuously distrib-
24 ute to the board of county commissioners an amount equal to the
25 last quarter's distribution prior to dissolution or disincorpora-
26 tion. The board of county commissioners shall determine any re-
27 distribution of moneys so received.
28 (vi) Taxing districts formed after January 1, 2001, are not en-
29 titled to a payment under the provisions of this paragraph (c) of
30 this subsection.
31 (vii) For purposes of this paragraph (c) of this subsection, a spe-
32 cial purpose taxing district is any taxing district that is not a
33 city, a county, or a school district.
34 (viii) Special purpose taxing districts shall use funds received
35 under the provisions of this subsection only for the purposes for
36 which the special purpose taxing districts were formed.
37 (11) Amounts calculated in accordance with section 2, chapter 356, laws
38 of 2001, for annual distribution to counties and other taxing districts be-
39 ginning in October 2001 for replacement of property tax on farm machinery and
40 equipment exempted pursuant to section 63-602EE, Idaho Code. For nonschool
41 districts, the state tax commission shall distribute one-fourth (1/4) of
42 this amount certified quarterly to each county. For school districts, the
43 state tax commission shall distribute one-fourth (1/4) of the amount cer-
44 tified quarterly to each school district. For nonschool districts, the
45 county auditor shall distribute such amounts to each district within thirty
46 (30) calendar days from receipt of moneys from the state tax commission.
