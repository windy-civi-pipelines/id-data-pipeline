26 19-2515. SENTENCE IN CAPITAL CASES -- SPECIAL SENTENCING PROCEEDING
27 -- STATUTORY AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES -- SPECIAL VERDICT OR WRITTEN FIND-
28 INGS. (1) Except as provided in section 19-2515A, Idaho Code, a person con-
29 victed of murder in the first degree or aggravated lewd conduct with a minor
30 child twelve (12) years of age or under shall be liable for the imposition of
31 the penalty of death if such person killed, intended a killing, or acted with
32 reckless indifference to human life, irrespective of whether such person di-
33 rectly committed the acts that caused death or the aggravated lewd conduct.
34 (2) Where a person is sentenced to serve a term in the penitentiary,
35 after conviction of a crime which falls within the provisions of section
36 20-1005, Idaho Code, except in cases where the court retains jurisdiction,
37 the comments and arguments of the counsel for the state and the defendant
38 relative to the sentencing and the comments of the judge relative to the
39 sentencing shall be recorded. If the comments are recorded electronically,
40 they need not be transcribed. Otherwise, they shall be transcribed by the
41 court reporter.
42 (3) Where a person is convicted of an offense which may be punishable by
43 death, a sentence of death shall not be imposed unless:
44 (a) A notice of intent to seek the death penalty was filed and served as
45 provided in section 18-4004A, Idaho Code; and
46 (b) The jury, or the court if a jury is waived, finds beyond a reasonable
47 doubt at least one (1) statutory aggravating circumstance for murder
48 and at least three (3) statutory aggravating circumstances, as listed
49 in subsection (10) of this section, for aggravated lewd conduct with a

7
1 minor child twelve (12) years of age or under. Where a statutory ag-
2 gravating circumstance is found, the defendant shall be sentenced to
3 death unless mitigating circumstances which may be presented are found
4 to be sufficiently compelling that the death penalty would be unjust.
5 The jury shall not direct imposition of a sentence of death unless it
6 unanimously finds at least one (1) statutory aggravating circumstance
7 and unanimously determines that the penalty of death should be imposed.
8 (4) Notwithstanding any court rule to the contrary, when a defendant is
9 adjudicated guilty of murder in the first degree or aggravated lewd conduct
10 with a minor child twelve (12) years of age or under, whether by acceptance of
11 a plea of guilty, by verdict of a jury, or by decision of the trial court sit-
12 ting without a jury, no presentence investigation shall be conducted; pro-
13 vided however, that if a special sentencing proceeding is not held or if a
14 special sentencing proceeding is held but no statutory aggravating circum-
15 stance has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the court may order that a
16 presentence investigation be conducted.
17 (5)(a) If a person is adjudicated guilty of murder in the first degree
18 or aggravated lewd conduct with a minor child twelve (12) years of age or
19 under, whether by acceptance of a plea of guilty, by verdict of a jury,
20 or by decision of the trial court sitting without a jury, and a notice
21 of intent to seek the death penalty was filed and served as provided in
22 section 18-4004A, Idaho Code, a special sentencing proceeding shall be
23 held promptly for the purpose of hearing all relevant evidence and ar-
24 guments of counsel in aggravation and mitigation of the offense. Infor-
25 mation concerning the victim and the impact that the death or aggravated
26 lewd conduct of the victim has had on the victim's family is relevant and
27 admissible. Such information shall be designed to demonstrate the vic-
28 tim's uniqueness as an individual human being and the resultant loss to
29 the community or impact caused by the victim's death or lewd conduct of
30 the victim. Characterizations and opinions about the crime, the defen-
31 dant and the appropriate sentence shall not be permitted as part of any
32 victim impact information. The special sentencing proceeding shall be
33 conducted before a jury unless a jury is waived by the defendant with the
34 consent of the prosecuting attorney.
35 (b) If the defendant's guilt was determined by a jury verdict, the same
36 jury shall hear the special sentencing proceeding; provided however,
37 that if it is impracticable to reconvene the same jury to hear the spe-
38 cial sentencing proceeding due to an insufficient number of jurors, the
39 trial court may dismiss that jury and convene a new jury of twelve (12)
40 persons, plus alternate jurors as the trial court deems necessary pur-
41 suant to section 19-1904, Idaho Code.
42 (c) If the defendant's guilt was determined by a plea of guilty or by a
43 decision of the trial court sitting without a jury, or if a retrial of
44 the special sentencing proceeding is necessary for any reason includ-
45 ing, but not limited to, a mistrial in a previous special sentencing
46 proceeding or as a consequence of a remand from an appellate court, the
47 trial court shall impanel a jury of twelve (12) persons, plus alternate
48 jurors as the trial court deems necessary pursuant to section 19-1904,
49 Idaho Code, unless such jury is waived.

8
1 (d) If a special sentencing proceeding is conducted before a newly im-
2 paneled jury pursuant to the provisions of subsection (5)(b) or (5)(c)
3 of this section, the state and the defense may present evidence to in-
4 form the jury of the nature and circumstances of the murder or aggra-
5 vated lewd conduct for which the defendant was convicted. The newly im-
6 paneled jury shall be instructed that the defendant has previously been
7 found guilty of first-degree murder or aggravated lewd conduct with a
8 minor child twelve (12) years of age or under and that the jury's purpose
9 is limited to making findings relevant for sentencing.
10 (6) At the special sentencing proceeding, the state and the defendant
11 shall be entitled to present all relevant evidence in aggravation and miti-
12 gation. Disclosure of evidence to be relied on in the sentencing proceeding
13 shall be made in accordance with Idaho criminal rule 16. Evidence admitted
14 at trial shall be considered and need not be repeated at the sentencing hear-
15 ing.
16 (7) The jury shall be informed as follows:
17 (a) If the jury finds that a statutory aggravating circumstance exists
18 and no mitigating circumstances exist which would make the imposition
19 of the death penalty unjust, the defendant will be sentenced to death by
20 the court.
21 (b) If the jury finds the existence of a statutory aggravating circum-
22 stance but finds that the existence of mitigating circumstances makes
23 the imposition of the death penalty unjust or the jury cannot unani-
24 mously agree on whether the existence of mitigating circumstances makes
25 the imposition of the death penalty unjust, the defendant will be sen-
26 tenced to a term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole;
27 and
28 (c) If the jury does not find the existence of a statutory aggravating
29 circumstance or if the jury cannot unanimously agree on the existence of
30 a statutory aggravating circumstance, the defendant will be sentenced
31 by the court to a term of life imprisonment with a fixed term of not less
32 than ten (10) years for first-degree murder or thirty (30) years for ag-
33 gravated lewd conduct with a minor child twelve (12) years of age or un-
34 der.
35 (8) Upon the conclusion of the evidence and arguments in mitigation and
36 aggravation:
37 (a) With regard to each statutory aggravating circumstance alleged by
38 the state, the jury shall return a special verdict stating:
39 (i) Whether the statutory aggravating circumstance has been
40 proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and
41 (ii) If the statutory aggravating circumstance has been proven
42 beyond a reasonable doubt, whether all mitigating circumstances,
43 when weighed against the aggravating circumstance, are suffi-
44 ciently compelling that the death penalty would be unjust.
45 (b) If a jury has been waived, the court shall:
46 (i) Make written findings setting forth any statutory aggravat-
47 ing circumstance found beyond a reasonable doubt;
48 (ii) Set forth in writing any mitigating circumstances consid-
49 ered; and

9
1 (iii) Upon weighing all mitigating circumstances against each
2 statutory aggravating circumstance separately, determine whether
3 mitigating circumstances are found to be sufficiently compelling
4 that the death penalty would be unjust and detail in writing its
5 reasons for so finding.
6 (9) The following are statutory aggravating circumstances, at least
7 one (1) of which must be found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt before a
8 sentence of death can be imposed for murder in the first degree:
9 (a) The defendant was previously convicted of another murder.
10 (b) At the time the murder was committed the defendant also committed
11 another murder.
12 (c) The defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many per-
13 sons.
14 (d) The murder was committed for remuneration or the promise of remu-
15 neration or the defendant employed another to commit the murder for re-
16 muneration or the promise of remuneration.
17 (e) The murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting
18 exceptional depravity.
