33 censee information relevant to the breach.

35 agency advises the agency, individual, or commercial entity that the notice
36 will impede a criminal investigation. Notice required by this section must
37 be made in good faith, without unreasonable delay and as soon as possible af-
38 ter the law enforcement agency advises the agency, individual, or commercial
39 entity that notification will no longer impede the investigation.
40 (4) An agency, individual, or commercial entity that has determined
41 that the misuse of PII about an Idaho resident has occurred or is reasonably
42 likely to occur shall, in addition to the notice required by this section:
43 (a) Offer to provide credit monitoring services at no cost to the af-
44 fected resident for a period of not less than twelve (12) months; and
45 (b) Provide information on how to enroll in the free credit monitor-

2 REQUIREMENTS. (1) An agency, an individual, or a commercial entity that
3 maintains its own notice procedures as part of an information security pol-
4 icy for the treatment of personal personally identifiable information, and
5 whose procedures are otherwise consistent with the timing requirements of
6 section 28-51-105, Idaho Code, is deemed to be in compliance with the notice
7 requirements of section 28-51-105, Idaho Code, if the agency, individual, or
8 the commercial entity notifies affected Idaho residents in accordance with
9 its policies in the event of a breach of security of the system.
10 (2) An individual or a commercial entity that is regulated by state or
11 federal law and that maintains procedures for a breach of the security of
12 the system pursuant to the laws, rules, regulations, guidances, or guide-
13 lines established by its primary or functional state or federal regulator is
14 deemed to be in compliance with section 28-51-105, Idaho Code, if the indi-
15 vidual or the commercial entity complies with the maintained procedures when
16 a breach of the security of the system occurs.
17 SECTION 4. That Section 28-51-107, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
18 hereby amended to read as follows:
19 28-51-107. VIOLATIONS. In any case in which an agency's, commercial
20 entity's or individual's primary regulator has reason to believe that an
21 agency, individual or commercial entity subject to that primary regula-
22 tor's jurisdiction under section 28-51-104(6) (7), Idaho Code, has violated
23 section 28-51-105, Idaho Code, by failing to give notice in accordance
24 with that section, the primary regulator may bring a civil action to en-
25 force compliance with that section and enjoin that agency, individual or
26 commercial entity from further violations. Any agency, individual or com-
27 mercial entity that intentionally fails to give notice in accordance with
28 section 28-51-105, Idaho Code, shall be subject to a fine of not more than
29 twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) per breach of the security of the
30 system.
