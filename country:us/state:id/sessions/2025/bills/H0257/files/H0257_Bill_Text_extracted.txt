14 conflicts of interest, pecuniary or otherwise, with affiliated educa-

16 (d) Charter holders shall retain accountability for academic, fiscal,

19 (e) Contracts must ensure that school boards retain the right to termi-

21 ter notice and a reasonable cure period has expired and if material de-
22 ficiencies have not been cured prior to that time period expiring;
23 (f) Contracts must ensure that assets purchased by educational ser-

32 requirements that state entities not enter into contracts that obligate

34 lature;

39 the virtual school's financial risk when it does not have sufficient
40 residual funds to pay the educational services provider. Where this
41 paragraph is applicable, the educational services provider shall make
42 its audited financial statements available, unless the educational
43 services provider already makes such audited financial statements pub-
44 licly available for compliance with other federal or state laws.
45 (9) Admission procedures, including provision for over-enrollment,
46 shall provide that the initial admission procedures for a public charter
47 school will be determined by lottery or other random method, except as oth-
48 erwise provided in this section. A charter holder shall strive to ensure
49 that citizens in the primary attendance area are made aware of the enrollment
50 opportunities and deadline. The public notice must include the enrollment
4
1 deadline, the public charter school's total enrollment capacity for the next
2 school year, and an advisory that all prospective students will be given
3 the opportunity to enroll in the public charter school regardless of race,
4 color, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, socioeconomic status,
5 or special needs.
6 (a) If initial capacity is insufficient to enroll all pupils who submit
7 a timely application, then the admission procedures may provide that
8 preference shall be given in the following order: first, to children
9 of founders, provided that this admission preference shall be limited
10 to not more than ten percent (10%) of the capacity of the public charter
11 school; second, to siblings of pupils already selected by the lottery
12 or other random method; third, to children of families with at least one
13 (1) parent or legal guardian who is on active duty or on active guard and
14 reserve duty, as those terms are defined in 10 U.S.C. 101; fourth, to
15 pupils seeking to transfer from another Idaho public charter school or
16 authorizer at which they have been enrolled for at least one (1) year,
17 provided that this admission preference shall be subject to an exist-
18 ing written agreement for such preference between the subject charter
19 schools or authorizer; fourth fifth, to students residing within the
20 primary attendance area of the public charter school; and fifth sixth,
21 by an equitable selection process such as a lottery or other random
22 method. A public charter school may weight the school's lottery to
23 preference admission for the following educationally disadvantaged
24 students: students living at or below one hundred eighty-five percent
25 (185%) of the federal poverty level, students who are homeless or in
26 foster care, children with disabilities as defined in section 33-2001,
27 Idaho Code, students with limited English proficiency, and students who
28 are at-risk as defined in section 33-1001, Idaho Code. A public charter
29 school may include the children of full-time employees of the public
30 charter school within the first priority group, subject to the limita-
31 tions therein.
32 (b) If capacity is insufficient to enroll all pupils who submit a timely
33 application for subsequent school terms, then the admission procedures
34 may provide that preference shall be given in the following order:
35 first, to pupils returning to the public charter school in the second
36 or any subsequent year of its operation; and then as provided in para-
37 graph (a) of this subsection. The sibling preference in subsequent
38 school years applies to siblings of a returning pupil and of a pupil
39 selected by the lottery or other random method. A new lottery shall be
40 conducted each year to fill vacancies that become available. A public
41 charter school may weight the school's lottery to preference admission
42 as provided in this paragraph and paragraph (a) of this subsection and
43 for children who attended the public charter school within the previous
44 three (3) school years but withdrew as a result of the relocation of a
45 parent or guardian due to an academic sabbatical or an employer or mili-
46 tary transfer or reassignment.
47 (c) Each public charter school shall establish a process under which a
48 child may apply for enrollment or register for courses, regardless of
49 where such child resides at the time of application or registration, if
50 the child is a dependent of a member of the United States armed forces
5
1 who has received transfer orders to a location in Idaho and will, upon
2 such transfer, reside in an area served by the public charter school.
3 If capacity is insufficient as described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this
4 subsection, a child described in this paragraph shall be treated as a
5 student residing within the primary attendance area of the public char-
6 ter school for purposes of preference. Otherwise, such children shall
7 be included in the highest priority group for which they would otherwise
8 be eligible.
9 (d) Admission to a public charter school shall be determined by a selec-
10 tion process held within seven (7) days of the enrollment deadlines es-
11 tablished by the charter holder. The selection process must take place
12 in a public setting, the date and time of which must be noticed to the
13 public at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance.
14 (e) Within seven (7) days after conducting the selection process, the
15 charter holder shall send an offer to the legal guardian who submitted a
16 written request for admission on behalf of a student notifying such per-
17 son that the student has been selected for admission to the public char-
18 ter school. An offer must be signed by such student's parent or guardian
19 and returned to the public charter school by the date designated in such
20 offer letter. Remaining students shall be notified that they may be el-
21 igible for admission at a later date if a seat becomes available.
22 (f) If a school exceeds its projected student count in a lottery and
23 a sufficient wait list exists, the school may increase enrollment by
24 adding additional students per grade, not to exceed the total amount of
25 students authorized by the charter.
26 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
27 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
28 July 1, 2025.

1 deadline, the public charter school's total enrollment capacity for the next
2 school year, and an advisory that all prospective students will be given
3 the opportunity to enroll in the public charter school regardless of race,
4 color, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, socioeconomic status,
5 or special needs.
6 (a) If initial capacity is insufficient to enroll all pupils who submit
7 a timely application, then the admission procedures may provide that
8 preference shall be given in the following order: first, to children
9 of founders, provided that this admission preference shall be limited
10 to not more than ten percent (10%) of the capacity of the public charter
11 school; second, to siblings of pupils already selected by the lottery
12 or other random method; third, to children of families with at least one
13 (1) parent or legal guardian who is on active duty or on active guard and
14 reserve duty, as those terms are defined in 10 U.S.C. 101; fourth, to
15 pupils seeking to transfer from another Idaho public charter school or
16 authorizer at which they have been enrolled for at least one (1) year,
17 provided that this admission preference shall be subject to an exist-
18 ing written agreement for such preference between the subject charter
19 schools or authorizer; fourth fifth, to students residing within the
20 primary attendance area of the public charter school; and fifth sixth,
21 by an equitable selection process such as a lottery or other random
22 method. A public charter school may weight the school's lottery to
23 preference admission for the following educationally disadvantaged
24 students: students living at or below one hundred eighty-five percent
25 (185%) of the federal poverty level, students who are homeless or in
26 foster care, children with disabilities as defined in section 33-2001,
27 Idaho Code, students with limited English proficiency, and students who
28 are at-risk as defined in section 33-1001, Idaho Code. A public charter
29 school may include the children of full-time employees of the public
30 charter school within the first priority group, subject to the limita-
31 tions therein.
32 (b) If capacity is insufficient to enroll all pupils who submit a timely
33 application for subsequent school terms, then the admission procedures
34 may provide that preference shall be given in the following order:
35 first, to pupils returning to the public charter school in the second
36 or any subsequent year of its operation; and then as provided in para-
37 graph (a) of this subsection. The sibling preference in subsequent
38 school years applies to siblings of a returning pupil and of a pupil
39 selected by the lottery or other random method. A new lottery shall be
40 conducted each year to fill vacancies that become available. A public
41 charter school may weight the school's lottery to preference admission
42 as provided in this paragraph and paragraph (a) of this subsection and
43 for children who attended the public charter school within the previous
44 three (3) school years but withdrew as a result of the relocation of a
45 parent or guardian due to an academic sabbatical or an employer or mili-
46 tary transfer or reassignment.
47 (c) Each public charter school shall establish a process under which a
48 child may apply for enrollment or register for courses, regardless of
49 where such child resides at the time of application or registration, if
50 the child is a dependent of a member of the United States armed forces

5
1 who has received transfer orders to a location in Idaho and will, upon
2 such transfer, reside in an area served by the public charter school.
3 If capacity is insufficient as described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this
4 subsection, a child described in this paragraph shall be treated as a
5 student residing within the primary attendance area of the public char-
6 ter school for purposes of preference. Otherwise, such children shall
7 be included in the highest priority group for which they would otherwise
8 be eligible.
9 (d) Admission to a public charter school shall be determined by a selec-
10 tion process held within seven (7) days of the enrollment deadlines es-
11 tablished by the charter holder. The selection process must take place
12 in a public setting, the date and time of which must be noticed to the
13 public at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance.
14 (e) Within seven (7) days after conducting the selection process, the
15 charter holder shall send an offer to the legal guardian who submitted a
16 written request for admission on behalf of a student notifying such per-
17 son that the student has been selected for admission to the public char-
18 ter school. An offer must be signed by such student's parent or guardian
19 and returned to the public charter school by the date designated in such
20 offer letter. Remaining students shall be notified that they may be el-
21 igible for admission at a later date if a seat becomes available.
22 (f) If a school exceeds its projected student count in a lottery and
23 a sufficient wait list exists, the school may increase enrollment by
24 adding additional students per grade, not to exceed the total amount of
25 students authorized by the charter.
26 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
27 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
28 July 1, 2025.
