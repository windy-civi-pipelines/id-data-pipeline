30 (18) years of age but under twenty-one (21) years of age shall expire five (5)
31 days after the person's twenty-first birthday, except as otherwise provided
32 in subsection (7) of this section.
33 (4) Individuals required to register in compliance with section 3
34 of the federal military selective service act, 50 U.S.C. 451 et seq., as
35 amended, shall be provided an opportunity to fulfill such registration re-
36 quirements in conjunction with an application for an identification card.
37 Any registration information so supplied shall be transmitted by the depart-
38 ment to the selective service system.
39 (5) Every identification card, except those issued to persons under
40 twenty-one (21) years of age, shall be renewable on or before its expiration,
41 but not more than twenty-five (25) months before, and upon application and
42 payment of the required fee.
43 (6) The applicant for an identification card must submit proof of iden-
44 tity and citizenship status acceptable to the examiner or the department and
45 date of birth as set forth in a certified copy of his birth certificate. When
46 a certified copy of his birth certificate or a delayed birth certificate is
47 impossible to obtain from a vital statistics agency, another government-is-
48 sued document may be submitted that provides satisfactory evidence of a per-
49 son's full legal name and date of birth acceptable to the examiner or the de-
50 partment.

10
1 (7) Every identification card issued to a person who is a citizen of the
2 United States shall, where possible, include the notation "USA." Every iden-
3 tification card issued to a person who is not a citizen or permanent legal
4 resident of the United States shall have an expiration date that is the same
5 date as the end of lawful stay in the United States as indicated on documents
6 issued and verified by the department of homeland security; however, the ex-
7 piration date shall not extend beyond the expiration date for the same cate-
8 gory of identification card issued to citizens. Persons whose department of
9 homeland security documents do not state an expiration date shall be issued
10 an identification card with an expiration date of one (1) year from the date
11 of issuance.
12 (8) When an identification card has been expired for less than twenty-
13 five (25) months, the renewal of the identification card shall start from
14 the original date of expiration, regardless of the year in which the applica-
15 tion for renewal is made. If the identification card is expired for more than
16 twenty-five (25) months, the application shall expire, at the option of the
17 applicant, on the applicant's birthday in the fourth year or the eighth year
18 following reissuance of the identification card, except as otherwise pro-
19 vided in subsection (7) of this section.
20 (9)(a) If an Idaho identification card has expired or will expire and
21 the identification card holder is temporarily out of state, except
22 on active military duty, the identification card holder may request
23 in writing on a form prescribed by the department an extension of the
24 identification card. The request shall be accompanied by the fee
25 fixed in section 49-306, Idaho Code, and the extension shall be no more
26 than a twelve (12) month period. If the department determines that an
27 extension of the identification card is necessary, it may issue an iden-
28 tification card showing the date to which the expired identification
29 card is extended. Identification card extensions are limited to two (2)
30 consecutive extensions per identification card holder.
31 (b) Upon returning to the state of Idaho, the identification card
32 holder shall, within ten (10) days, apply for a renewal of the expired
33 identification card and surrender the extended identification card and
34 the expired identification card.
35 (10) An Idaho identification card issued to any person prior to serving
36 on active duty in the armed forces of the United States, or a member of the
37 immediate family accompanying such a person, if valid and in full force and
38 effect upon entering active duty, shall remain in full force and effect and
39 shall, upon application, be extended for a period of four (4) years as long
40 as active duty continues, and the identification card shall remain in full
41 force and effect sixty (60) days following the date the card holder is re-
42 leased from active duty.
43 (11) A person possessing an identification card who desires to donate
44 any or all organs or tissue in the event of death, and who has completed a
45 document of gift pursuant to the provisions for donation of anatomical gifts
46 as set forth in chapter 34, title 39, Idaho Code, may, at the option of the
47 donor, indicate this desire on the identification card by the imprinting of
48 the word "donor" on the identification card. The provisions of this subsec-
49 tion shall apply to persons possessing an identification card who are fif-
50 teen (15) years of age or older but less than eighteen (18) years of age if

11
1 the requirements provided in chapter 34, title 39, Idaho Code, have been com-
2 plied with.
3 (12) A person possessing an identification card or an applicant for an
4 identification card who is a person with a permanent disability may request
5 that the notation "permanently disabled" be imprinted on the identification
6 card, provided the person presents written certification from a licensed
7 physician verifying that the person's stated impairment qualifies as a per-
8 manent disability according to the provisions of section 49-117, Idaho Code.
9 (13) A person who is a veteran may request that his or her status as such
10 be designated on an identification card at no additional cost. Any such re-
11 quest shall be accompanied by proof of being a current or former member of
12 the United States armed forces. Upon request and submission of satisfactory
13 proof, the department shall indicate such person's status as a veteran on any
14 identification card issued pursuant to the provisions of this section. Such
15 designation shall be made upon original issuance or renewal of an identifi-
16 cation card. Designation shall also be made on any duplicate identification
17 card issued, provided that the fee for such duplicate card is paid in accor-
18 dance with this section.
19 (14) Satisfactory proof of being a current or former member of the
20 United States armed forces must be furnished by an applicant to the de-
21 partment before a designation of veteran status will be indicated on any
22 identification card. Acceptable proof shall be a copy of form DD214 or an
23 equivalent document or statement from the department of veterans affairs
24 that identifies a character of service upon separation as "honorable" or
25 "general under honorable conditions."
26 (15) In the case of a name change, the applicant shall provide legal doc-
27 umentation to verify the change in accordance with department rules.
28 (16) Whenever any person, after applying for or receiving an identifi-
29 cation card, moves from the address shown on the application or on the iden-
30 tification card issued, that person shall, within thirty (30) days, notify
31 the transportation department in writing of the old and new addresses.
32 (17) The department shall cancel any identification card upon determin-
33 ing that the person was not entitled to the issuance of the identification
34 card or that the person failed to give the required and correct information
35 in his application or committed fraud in making the application. Upon can-
36 cellation, the person shall surrender the canceled identification card to
37 the department.
38 (18) If any person shall fail to return to the department the identifi-
39 cation card as required, the department may direct any peace officer to se-
40 cure its possession and return the identification card to the department.
41 (19) The department may issue a no-fee identification card to an indi-
42 vidual whose driver's license has been canceled and voluntarily surrendered
43 as provided in section 49-322(5), Idaho Code. The identification card may be
44 renewed at no cost to the applicant as long as the driver's license remains
45 canceled.
46 (20) It is an infraction for any person to fail to notify the department
47 of a change of address as required by the provisions of subsection (16) of
48 this section.
49 (21) The department may issue an initial four (4) year no-fee identifi-
50 cation card to an individual who is homeless. The department shall establish

12
1 a form for verification of homelessness pursuant to this section. Such form
2 shall require the signature of an outreach worker or service worker verify-
3 ing that the individual is homeless and attesting to the individual's resi-
4 dency at an Idaho relief agency or shelter. An applicant issued an identifi-
5 cation card under the provisions of this subsection shall be entitled to one
6 (1) free replacement. Subsequent replacements and renewals of this identi-
7 fication card will be subject to the fees imposed in this section.
8 (22) The department shall issue a four (4) year no-fee identification
9 card to any individual eighteen (18) years of age or older who indicates on
10 the application that an identification card is needed to comply with voter
11 registration or voting requirements. An applicant issued an identification
12 card under this subsection shall be entitled to one (1) free replacement.
13 Such applicants are entitled to no-fee renewals as long as the applicant
14 meets the requirements of this subsection at the time of renewal.
15 SECTION 7. That Chapter 24, Title 49, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
16 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
17 ignated as Section 49-2444A, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:

20 an individual to obtain an electronic identification card in addition to a
21 physical identification card.
