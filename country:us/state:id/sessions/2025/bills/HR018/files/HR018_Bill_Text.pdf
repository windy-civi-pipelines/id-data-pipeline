BY HEALTH AND WELFARE COMMITTEE
1 A HOUSE RESOLUTION
2 STATING FINDINGS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND PROVIDING FOR THE
3 AMENDMENT OF RULE 6 OF THE RULES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
4 Be It Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of Idaho:
5 WHEREAS, the House of Representatives deems it necessary and desirable
6 that Rule 6 of the Rules of the House of Representatives be amended.
7 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the House of Represen-
8 tatives, assembled in the First Regular Session of the Sixty-eighth Idaho
9 Legislature, that Rule 6 of the Rules of the House of Representatives shall
10 be amended to read as follows:
11 RULE 6
12 Bills -- Introduction. -- Limits -- Transparency. -- (1)Except as pro-
13 vided in subsection (2) of this rule, no No bill shall be introduced except
14 by committees and after the 36th day no bill shall be introduced except by the
15 State Affairs Committee, the Appropriations Committee, the Education Com-
16 mittee, the Revenue and Taxation Committee, the Health and Welfare Commit-
17 tee, and the Ways and Means Committee. When essential to expedite the work
18 of the House, the Speaker may designate any standing committee to serve as a
19 privileged committee temporarily or during the remainder of the session.
20 (2)A bill may be introduced by submission thereof to the Chief Clerk,
21 and such bill shall, after it is assigned a bill number, be maintained in the
22 office of the Chief Clerk. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply
23 to a concurrent resolution enabling a joint session of the House of Represen-
24 tatives and the Senate at the commencement of the legislative session.
25 (2) Except as otherwise provided, the introduction of bills, which for
26 the purposes of this subsection shall include bills, resolutions, and memo-
27 rials, by members of the House of Representatives shall be limited as fol-
28 lows:
29 (a) Except for appropriation bills and bills sponsored by a state
30 agency, each member of the House of Representatives may introduce as
31 a sponsor no more than twelve (12) bills in any legislative session.
32 To assist in the identification of sponsors, the statement of purpose
33 for each bill shall state "lead sponsor" next to the member who is the
34 lead sponsor of the bill and shall state "sponsor" next to any other
35 member who is a sponsor of the bill. The limitations provided in this
36 rule shall not apply to any list of legislative cosponsors attached to
37 or filed with a statement of purpose. If all sponsors of a bill agree,
38 they may substitute a new bill for a previously introduced bill, as long
39 as the substance of the new bill is substantially the same, and the new
40 bill shall not count towards the bill limits provided in this rule. The
41 previous bill shall be clearly marked in the records as having been su-
42 perseded and no further action on the bill shall be permitted.

2
1 (b) During any regular session, a member who has not reached the bill
2 introduction limit shall have priority in bill drafting requests over
3 members who have reached their bill introduction limit.
4 (c) If a bill originating in the House of Representatives is voted on
5 and fails to pass either the House of Representatives or the Senate,
6 no member may reintroduce the same or any substantially similar bill
7 from the time such bill failed to pass until a legislative session after
8 the end of the next regular annual session. For the purposes of this
9 paragraph, "substantially similar bill" means a bill that maintains the
10 same intent or core provisions.
11 (d) The Speaker of the House of Representatives may grant exemptions
12 to the limitations provided in this subsection if deemed necessary and
13 may delegate the authority to grant such exceptions to any committee
14 chairman. If any sponsor of a bill is granted an exemption pursuant to
15 this paragraph, the statement of purpose shall clearly indicate next to
16 the sponsor's name that the sponsor has been granted an exemption to the
17 bill introduction limit and shall state "[Exempt from House Rule 6(2)]"
18 next to the sponsor's name.
19 (3) If a bill does not originate from a member's own initiative, the
20 bill's statement of purpose shall clearly identify the lobbyist, agency,
21 entity, or political organization that proposed the legislation included in
22 the bill; provided, however, this requirement shall not apply if the legis-
23 lation originated from a constituent of the member who is not affiliated with
24 any such person or entity.
