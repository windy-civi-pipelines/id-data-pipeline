16 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
17 SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. (1) The Legislature finds that Idaho
18 students and families deserve access to education that meets individual
19 needs and offers a competitive curriculum with accountability and trans-
20 parency.
21 (2) The Legislature further finds that the lower the family's income,
22 the greater the burden on Idaho students when it comes to accessing resources
23 to enhance their education opportunities, and that public schools must navi-
24 gate the challenges of often burdensome regulation and non-competitive sys-
25 tems that demand educators spend even more time dealing with administrative
26 requirements, which drives up administrative costs in public schools and re-
27 duces the available time to focus on students.
28 (3) The Legislature further finds that special education funding for
29 Idaho public schools falls at least $66.5 million short of meeting the needs
30 of the approximately 37,000 students who qualify for services. This bud-
31 get gap impacts the ability to recruit and retain special education staff and
32 provide the vital support and resources these students and families need.
33 (4) Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature: to provide a uni-
34 versal education grant that is available to all Idahoans in need of other
35 education options while prioritizing the neediest families; to eliminate
36 unnecessary and duplicative reporting that burdens Idaho's public schools;
37 to streamline public school open enrollment; and to continuously appro-
38 priate $30,000,000 in additional spending for directed spending on special
39 education in Idaho public schools distributed under the public school fund-
40 ing formula approved in Idaho Code.

31 choice within a district that have lottery enrollment policies are not sub-
32 ject to the provisions of this chapter.
33 (2) Whenever the parent or guardian of any Idaho pupil determines that
34 it is in the best interest of the pupil to attend a school within another dis-
35 trict, or to attend another school within the home district, such pupil may

20 ent or guardian does not need to reapply to regain acceptance the next school
21 year. However, the parent or guardian must provide notice to the receiving
22 school or district of intent for the pupil to reenroll. The district may pre-
23 scribe the form of notice. Once a pupil has been enrolled at the same school
24 for a second consecutive year, the pupil may complete his education at such
25 school, unless the pupil's approved transfer has been revoked pursuant to
26 this section.
27 (8) Whenever any pupil enrolls in and attends a school outside the dis-
28 trict within which the parent or guardian resides, the parent or guardian
29 shall be responsible for transporting the pupil to and from the school or
30 to an appropriate bus stop within the receiving district. For students at-
31 tending another school within the home district, the parent or guardian is
32 responsible for transporting the pupil to and from an appropriate bus stop.

43 sion; or

47 subsection (7) of this section, the receiving district may not revoke a
48 transfer approval to a school after two (2) consecutive years of atten-
49 dance. If a transfer approval is revoked under this subsection, the re-

9
1 ceiving district must offer the pupil information about other schools
2 within the district that are below maximum enrollment.
3 (10) A receiving school shall inform the parent or guardian of the cir-
4 cumstances that jeopardize the student's status at a transfer school.

6 tion by resident pupils to attend school in another school district or to at-

15 dard to determine maximum enrollment.

17 district shall publicly post on its website the space available at each
18 grade-level grade level, special program, and at each school. Space avail-
19 able shall be determined by comparing the maximum enrollment to the number of
20 pupils actually enrolled. A school district that does not meet the minimum
21 sample size necessary to prevent unlawful release of personally identifi-
22 able student data established pursuant to subsection (5) of this section is
23 not subject to the publication requirements pursuant to this subsection.
24 (3) Not less than four (4) times during the school year, every school
25 district shall report to the state reporting system the space available at
26 each grade-level grade level, school, and in each program, the number of
27 transfer applications, the number of accepted transferred pupils, and the
28 number of denied applications.
29 (4) By September 1 each year, the state board of education shall col-
30 lect, analyze, and publish to its website the capacity and transfer data from
31 each school district from the previous year. The report shall include the
32 number of participants, the number of denied applications, and other rele-
33 vant information. The state board of education shall also report this infor-
34 mation to the legislature no later than February 1 of each year.
35 (5) The state board of education shall not publish or release data of
36 a school district if the number of students who applied for a transfer is
37 less than the minimum sample size necessary for prevention of the unlawful
38 release of personally identifiable student data. The state board of educa-
39 tion shall establish the minimum number of students necessary to meet the re-
40 quirements of this subsection.
41 SECTION 10. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this act are hereby de-
42 clared to be severable and if any provision of this act or the application
