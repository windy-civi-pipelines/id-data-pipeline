17 ARTICLE 2. PERSONS SUBJECT TO THIS CODE -- JURISDICTION
18 (a) This code applies to all members of the state military forces when
19 serving in a title 32 status or state active duty status as defined in article
20 1(a)(5) of this code. This code does not apply to members serving in a title
21 10 status or members of the unorganized militia as defined in section 46-102,
22 Idaho Code.
23 (b) Subject matter jurisdiction is established if a nexus exists be-
24 tween an offense, either military or nonmilitary, and the state military
25 force, regardless of duty status. Courts-martial convened by the governor
26 or his designated representative have primary jurisdiction of military of-
27 fenses as defined in article 1(a)(18) of this code. A proper civilian court
28 has primary jurisdiction of a nonmilitary offense when an act or omission
29 violates both this code and local criminal law, foreign or domestic. In such
30 a case, a court-martial may be initiated only after the civilian authority
31 has declined to prosecute or dismissed the charge, provided jeopardy has not
32 attached. Jurisdiction over attempted crimes, conspiracy crimes, solicita-
33 tion, and accessory crimes must be determined by the underlying offense.
34 ARTICLE 3. JURISDICTION TO TRY CERTAIN PERSONNEL
35 (a) Subject to article 43, a person who is in a status in which the
36 person is subject to this chapter and who committed an offense against this
37 chapter while formerly in a status in which the person was subject to this
38 chapter is not relieved from amenability to the jurisdiction of this chapter
39 for that offense by reason of a termination of that person's former status.
40 (b) Each person discharged from the state military forces who is later
41 charged with having fraudulently obtained his discharge is, subject to ar-
42 ticle 43, subject to trial by court-martial on that charge and is, after ap-
43 prehension, subject to this chapter while in the custody of the state mili-
44 tary forces for that trial. Upon conviction of that charge, he is subject to
45 trial by court-martial for all offenses under this chapter committed before
46 the fraudulent discharge.

4
1 (c) No person who has deserted from the state military forces may be re-
2 lieved from amenability to the jurisdiction of this chapter by virtue of a
3 separation from any later period of service.
4 (d) A member of the state military forces who is subject to this chapter
5 is not, by virtue of the termination of a period of active duty for training
6 or inactive-duty training, relieved from amenability to the jurisdiction of
7 this chapter for an offense against this chapter committed during such pe-
8 riod of active duty or inactive-duty training.
9 ARTICLE 4. DISMISSED OFFICER'S RIGHT TO TRIAL BY COURT-MARTIAL
10 (a) If any commissioned officer, dismissed by order of the governor
11 or his designated representative, makes a written application for trial by
12 court-martial, setting forth, under oath, that he has been wrongfully dis-
13 missed, the governor or his designated representative, as soon as practica-
14 ble, shall convene a general court-martial to try that officer on the charges
15 on which he was dismissed. A court-martial so convened has jurisdiction
16 to try the dismissed officer on those charges, and he shall be considered
17 to have waived the right to plead any statute of limitations applicable to
18 any offense with which he is charged. The court-martial may, as part of its
19 sentence, adjudge the affirmance of the dismissal, but if the court-martial
20 acquits the accused or if the sentence adjudged, as finally approved or af-
21 firmed, the adjutant general shall substitute for the dismissal ordered by
22 the governor or his designated representative a form of discharge authorized
23 for administrative issue.
24 (b) If the governor or his designated representative fails to convene a
25 general court-martial within six (6) months from the presentation of an ap-
26 plication for trial under this article, the adjutant general shall substi-
27 tute for the dismissal ordered by the governor or his designated representa-
28 tive a form of discharge authorized for administrative issue.
29 (c) If a discharge is substituted for a dismissal under this article,
30 the governor or his designated representative alone may reappoint the offi-
31 cer to such commissioned grade and with such rank as, in the opinion of the
32 governor or his designated representative, that former officer would have
33 attained had he not been dismissed. The reappointment of such a former offi-
34 cer shall be without regard to the existence of a vacancy and shall affect the
35 promotion status of other officers only insofar as the governor or his des-
36 ignated representative may direct. All time between the dismissal and the
37 reappointment shall be considered as actual service for all purposes, in-
38 cluding the right to pay and allowances.
39 (d) If an officer is discharged from any armed force by administrative
40 action or is dropped from the rolls by order of the governor or his designated
41 representative, he has no right to trial under this article.
42 ARTICLE 5. TERRITORIAL APPLICABILITY OF THE CODE
43 (a) This code has applicability at all times and in all places subject
44 to the personal jurisdiction as provided in article 2 of this code, or, if
45 not in a duty status, that there is a nexus between the act or omission con-
46 stituting the offense and the efficient functioning of the state military

5
1 forces; however, this grant of military jurisdiction shall neither preclude
2 nor limit civilian jurisdiction over an offense, which is limited only by the
3 prohibition of double jeopardy.
4 (b) Courts-martial and courts of inquiry may be convened and held in
5 units of the state military forces while those units are serving outside the
6 state with the same jurisdiction and powers as to persons subject to this
7 code as if the proceedings were held inside the state, and offenses commit-
8 ted outside the state may be tried and punished either inside or outside the
9 state.
10 ARTICLE 6. JUDGE ADVOCATES AND LEGAL OFFICERS
11 (a) The senior force judge advocates in each of the state's military
12 forces or that judge advocate's delegates shall make frequent inspections in
13 the field in supervision of the administration of military justice in that
14 force.
15 (b) Convening authorities shall at all times communicate directly with
16 their staff judge advocates or legal officers in matters relating to the ad-
17 ministration of military justice. The staff judge advocate or legal officer
18 of any command is entitled to communicate directly with the staff judge advo-
19 cate or legal officer of a superior or subordinate command, or with the state
20 judge advocate.
21 (c)(1) No person who, with respect to a case, serves in a capacity spec-
22 ified in paragraph (2) of this subsection, may later serve as a staff
23 judge advocate or legal officer to any reviewing or convening authority
24 upon the same case.
25 (2) The capacities referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection are,
26 with respect to the case involved, any of the following:
27 (A) Preliminary hearing officer, court member, military judge,
28 military magistrate, or appellate judge; or
29 (B) Counsel who have acted in the same case or appeared in any pro-
30 ceeding before a military judge, military magistrate, preliminary
31 hearing officer, or appellate court.
32 ARTICLE 6a. INVESTIGATION AND DISPOSITION OF MAT-
33 TERS PERTAINING TO THE FITNESS OF MILITARY JUDGES
34 (a) The governor or his designee shall prescribe procedures for the
35 investigation and disposition of charges, allegations, or information per-
36 taining to the fitness of a military appellate judge, military judge, or
37 military magistrate to perform the duties of the position involved.
38 (b) The governor or his designee shall transmit a copy of the proce-
39 dures prescribed pursuant to this article to the appropriate committees of
40 the Idaho senate and Idaho house of representatives.

40 (d) Enforcement by the Idaho state courts:

30 under title 18, Idaho Code, that did not occur in the presence of the appre-
31 hender.

27 proper authority may be notified.
28 ARTICLE 10. RESTRAINT OF PERSONS CHARGED
29 (a) In general.
30 (1) Subject to article 9 and paragraph (2) of this subsection, any per-
31 son subject to this chapter who is charged with an offense under this
32 chapter may be ordered into arrest or confinement as the circumstances

11 of the offense charged against the prisoner, unless otherwise authorized by
12 law.
13 (c) Every person authorized to receive prisoners pursuant to subsec-
14 tion (a) of this article to whose charge a prisoner is committed shall,
15 within twenty-four (24) hours after that commitment or as soon as the person
16 is relieved from guard, report to the commanding officer of the prisoner the
17 name of the prisoner, the offense charged against the prisoner, and the name
18 of the person who ordered or authorized the commitment.
19 ARTICLE 12. CONFINEMENT WITH ENEMY PRISONERS PROHIBITED
20 No member of the state military forces may be placed in military confinement

25 No person, while being held for trial or awaiting a verdict, may be subjected
26 to punishment or penalty other than arrest or confinement upon the charges
27 pending against the person, nor shall the arrest or confinement imposed upon
28 such person be any more rigorous than the circumstances required to ensure
29 the person's presence.
30 ARTICLE 14. DELIVERY OF OFFENDERS TO CIVIL AUTHORITIES
31 (a) A person subject to this code accused of an offense against civil
32 authority may be delivered, upon request, to the civil authority for trial or
33 confinement.
34 (b) When delivery under this article is made to any civil authority of
35 a person undergoing sentence of a court-martial, the delivery, if followed
36 by conviction in a civil tribunal, interrupts the execution of the sentence
37 of the court-martial, and the offender after having answered to the civil au-
38 thorities for the offense shall, upon the request of competent military au-
39 thority, be returned to the place of original custody for the completion of

3 (2) Upon enlisted members of the officer's command:
4 (A) Any punishment authorized in subsection (c) of this article.
5 (e) Whenever any of those punishments are combined to run consec-
6 utively, the total length of the combined punishment cannot exceed the
7 authorized duration of the longest punishment in the combination, and there
8 must be an apportionment of punishments so that no single punishment in the
9 combination exceeds its authorized length under this article.
10 (f) Except in the case of a member attached to or embarked in a vessel,
11 punishment under this article may not be imposed on any member under this ar-
12 ticle if the member has, before the imposition of such punishment, demanded
13 trial by court-martial in lieu of such punishment. Except when punishment
14 includes arrest, confinement, or restriction to certain specified limits,
15 a member may not demand trial by court-martial. If any punishment sought
16 includes arrest, confinement, or restriction, a member may demand trial by
17 court-martial if the demand occurs before the imposition of punishment.
18 (g) The officer who imposes the punishment, or the successor in com-
19 mand, may, at any time, suspend, set aside, mitigate, or remit any part or
20 amount of the punishment and restore all rights, privileges, and property
21 affected. The officer also may:
22 (1) Mitigate reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay;
23 (2) Mitigate arrest in quarters to restriction; or
24 (3) Mitigate extra duties to restriction.
25 The mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than the punish-
26 ment mitigated. When mitigating reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay, the
27 amount of the forfeiture shall not be greater than the amount that could have
28 been imposed initially under this article by the officer who imposed the pun-
29 ishment mitigated.
30 (h) A person punished under this article who considers the punishment
31 unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through the proper channel,
32 appeal to the next superior authority within fifteen (15) days after the pun-
33 ishment is either announced or sent to the accused, as the commander may de-
34 termine. The appeal shall be promptly forwarded and decided, but the person
35 punished may in the meantime be required to undergo the punishment adjudged.
36 The superior authority may exercise the same powers with respect to the pun-
37 ishment imposed as may be exercised under subsection (g) of this article by
38 the officer who imposed the punishment. Unless the superior authority is an
39 O-7, the member may appeal up through and to the member's O-7 commander. All
40 superior authorities who review such appeal shall exercise the same powers
41 with respect to the punishment as the officer who imposed the original pun-
42 ishment. Before acting on an appeal from a punishment, the authority that is
43 to act on the appeal may refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration
44 and advice.
45 (i) The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment under
46 this article for any act or omission is not a bar to trial by court-martial
47 or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction for a serious crime or offense
48 growing out of the same act or omission and not properly punishable under
49 this article; but the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced
50 may be shown by the accused upon trial and, when so shown, it shall be consid-

12
1 ered in determining the measure of punishment to be adjudged in the event of
2 a finding of guilty.
3 (j) Whenever a punishment of forfeiture of pay is imposed under this ar-
4 ticle, the forfeiture may apply to pay accruing before, on, or after the date
5 that punishment is imposed.
6 (k) Regulations may prescribe the form of records to be kept of proceed-
7 ings under this article and may prescribe that certain categories of those
8 proceedings shall be in writing.

1 ARTICLE 50a. DEFENSE OF LACK OF MENTAL RESPONSIBILITY

3 the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused,
4 as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the
5 nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the acts. Mental disease or defect
6 does not otherwise constitute a defense.
7 (b) The accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental
8 responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.
9 (c) Whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect
10 to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge shall instruct the
11 members of the court as to the defense of lack of mental responsibility un-
12 der this article and charge them to find the accused:
13 (1) Guilty;
14 (2) Not guilty; or
15 (3) Not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.
16 (d) Subsection (c) of this article does not apply to a court-martial
17 composed of a military judge only. In the case of a court-martial composed
18 of a military judge only or a summary court-martial officer, whenever lack of
19 mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is properly
20 at issue, the military judge or summary court-martial officer shall find the
21 accused:
22 (1) Guilty;
23 (2) Not guilty; or
24 (3) Not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.
25 (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of article 52 of this code, the ac-
26 cused shall be found not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibil-
27 ity if:
28 (1) A majority of the members of the court-martial present at the time
29 the vote is taken determines that the defense of lack of mental respon-
30 sibility has been established; or
31 (2) In the case of a court-martial composed of a military judge only or
32 a summary court-martial officer, the military judge or summary court-
33 martial officer determines that the defense of lack of mental responsi-
34 bility has been established.
35 ARTICLE 51. VOTING AND RULINGS
36 (a) Voting by members of a general or special court-martial on the find-
37 ings and on the sentence shall be by secret written ballot. The junior member
38 of the court shall count the votes. The count shall be checked by the presi-
39 dent, who shall forthwith announce the result of the ballot to the members of
40 the court.
41 (b) The military judge shall rule upon all questions of law and all in-
42 terlocutory questions arising during the proceedings. Any such ruling made
43 by the military judge upon any question of law or any interlocutory question
44 other than the factual issue of mental responsibility of the accused is fi-
45 nal and constitutes the ruling of the court. However, the military judge may
46 change the ruling at any time during the trial. Unless the ruling is final,
47 if any member objects thereto, the court shall be cleared and closed and the

32
1 question decided by a voice vote as provided in article 52 of this code, be-
2 ginning with the junior in rank.
3 (c) Before a vote is taken on the findings, the military judge shall, in
4 the presence of the accused and counsel, instruct the members of the court as
5 to the elements of the offense and charge them:
6 (1) That the accused must be presumed to be innocent until his guilt is
7 established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt;
8 (2) That in the case being considered, if there is a reasonable doubt as
9 to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the
10 accused and the accused must be acquitted;
11 (3) That, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, the
12 finding must be in a lower degree as to which there is no reasonable
13 doubt; and
14 (4) That the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused be-
15 yond reasonable doubt is upon the state.
16 (d) Subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this article do not apply to a
17 court-martial composed of a military judge only. The military judge of such
18 a court-martial shall determine all questions of law and fact arising during
19 the proceedings and, if the accused is convicted, adjudge an appropriate
20 sentence. The military judge of such a court-martial shall make a general
21 finding and shall in addition, on request, find the facts specially. If an
22 opinion or memorandum of decision is filed, it will be sufficient if the
23 findings of fact appear therein.

26 special court-martial, other than:

37 majority vote, but a reconsideration of a finding of guilty or recon-
38 sideration of a sentence, with a view toward decreasing the sentence,
39 may be made by any lesser vote which indicates that the reconsideration
40 is not opposed by the number of votes required for that finding or sen-
41 tence.
42 (2) Sentencing. All sentences imposed by members shall be deter-
43 mined by the concurrence of at least three-fourths (3/4) of the members
44 present when the vote is taken.

2 mandatory minimum sentence for the offense charged.

41 PART VIII. SENTENCES
42 ARTICLE 55. CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENTS PROHIBITED
43 Punishment by flogging, or by branding, marking, or tattooing on the body, or
44 any other cruel or unusual punishment may not be adjudged by a court-martial

35
1 or inflicted upon any person subject to this code. The use of irons, single
2 or double, except for the purpose of safe custody, is prohibited.
3 ARTICLE 56. SENTENCING
4 (a) The punishment which a court-martial may direct for an offense may
5 not exceed such limits as prescribed by this code, but in no instance may a
6 sentence exceed more than ten (10) years for a military offense, nor shall a
7 sentence of death be adjudged. A conviction by general court-martial of any
8 military offense for which an accused may receive a sentence of confinement
9 for more than one (1) year is a felony offense. Except for convictions by a
10 summary court-martial, all other military offenses are misdemeanors. Any
11 conviction by a summary court-martial is not a criminal conviction.
12 (b) The limits of punishment for violations of the punitive articles
13 prescribed herein shall be the lesser of the sentences prescribed by the
14 manual for courts-martial of the United States currently in effect, and the
15 state manual for courts-martial, but in no instance shall any punishment
16 exceed that authorized by this code.
17 (c) Imposition of sentence.
18 (1) In general. In sentencing an accused, a court-martial shall impose
19 punishment that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to pro-
20 mote justice and to maintain good order and discipline in the state mil-
21 itary forces, taking into consideration:
22 (A) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the history
23 and characteristics of the accused;
24 (B) The impact of the offense on:
25 (i) The financial, social, psychological, or medical well-
26 being of any victim of the offense; and
27 (ii) The mission, discipline, or efficiency of the command
28 of the accused and any victim of the offense;
29 (C) The need for the sentence:
30 (i) To reflect the seriousness of the offense;
31 (ii) To promote respect for the law;
32 (iii) To provide just punishment for the offense;
33 (iv) To promote adequate deterrence of misconduct;
34 (v) To protect others from further crimes by the accused;
35 (vi) To rehabilitate the accused; and
36 (vii) To provide, in appropriate cases, the opportunity for
37 retraining and return to duty to meet the needs of the ser-
38 vice; and
39 (D) The sentences available under this chapter.
40 (2) Sentencing by military judge. In announcing the sentence in a gen-
41 eral or special court-martial in which the accused is sentenced by a
42 military judge alone under article 53, the military judge shall, with
43 respect to each offense of which the accused is found guilty, specify
44 the term of confinement, if any, and the amount of the fine, if any. If
45 the accused is sentenced to confinement for more than one (1) offense,
46 the military judge shall specify whether the terms of confinement are to
47 run consecutively or concurrently.

36
1 (3) Sentencing by members. In a general or special court-martial in
2 which the accused has elected sentencing by members, the court-martial
3 shall announce a single sentence for all of the offenses of which the ac-
4 cused was found guilty.
5 (d) Appeal of sentence to the district court of the county where the
6 court-martial is held.
7 (1) With the approval of the senior force judge advocate concerned, the
8 government may appeal a sentence, on the grounds that the sentence vio-
9 lates the law or the sentence is unreasonable.
10 (2) An appeal under this subsection must be filed within forty-two (42)
11 days after the date of entry of judgment.
12 ARTICLE 56a. RESERVED
13 ARTICLE 57. EFFECTIVE DATE OF SENTENCES
14 (a) Execution of sentences. A court-martial sentence shall be executed
15 and take effect as follows:
16 (1) Forfeiture and reduction. A forfeiture of pay or allowances shall
17 be applicable to pay and allowances accruing on and after the date on
18 which the sentence takes effect. Any forfeiture of pay or allowances
19 or reduction in grade that is included in a sentence of a court-martial
20 takes effect on the earlier of:
21 (A) The date that is fourteen (14) days after the date on which the
22 sentence is adjudged; or
23 (B) In the case of a summary court-martial, the date on which the
24 sentence is approved by the convening authority.
25 (2) Confinement. Any period of confinement included in a sentence of
26 a court-martial begins to run from the date the sentence is adjudged by
27 the court-martial, but periods during which the sentence to confinement
28 is suspended or deferred shall be excluded in computing the service of
29 the term of confinement.
30 (3) Approval of dismissal. If, in the case of a commissioned officer,
31 or cadet, or midshipman, the sentence of a court-martial extends to dis-
32 missal, that part of the sentence providing for dismissal may not be ex-
33 ecuted until approved by the secretary concerned or such undersecretary
34 or assistant secretary as may be designated by the secretary concerned.
35 In such a case, the secretary, undersecretary, or assistant secretary,
36 as the case may be, may commute, remit, or suspend the sentence, or any
37 part of the sentence, as the secretary sees fit. In time of war or na-
38 tional emergency, he may commute a sentence of dismissal to reduction to
39 any enlisted grade. A person so reduced may be required to serve for the
40 duration of the war or emergency and six (6) months thereafter.
41 (4) Completion of appellate review. If a sentence extends to dis-
42 missal, or a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, that part of the
43 sentence extending to dismissal, or a dishonorable or bad-conduct dis-
44 charge, may be executed in accordance with service regulations after
45 completion of appellate review and, with respect to dismissal, approval
46 under paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection, as appropriate.

37
1 (5) Other sentences. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
2 a general or special court-martial sentence is effective upon entry of
3 judgment and a summary court-martial sentence is effective when the
4 convening authority acts on the sentence.
5 (b) Deferral of sentences.
6 (1) In general. On application by an accused, the convening authority
7 or, if the accused is no longer under his jurisdiction, the officer ex-
8 ercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which
9 the accused is currently assigned may, in his sole discretion, defer the
10 effective date of a sentence of confinement, reduction, or forfeiture.
11 The deferment shall terminate upon entry of judgment or, in the case of
12 a summary court-martial, when the convening authority acts on the sen-
13 tence. The deferment may be rescinded at any time by the officer who
14 granted it or, if the accused is no longer under his jurisdiction, by the
15 officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command
16 to which the accused is currently assigned.
17 (2) Deferral of certain persons sentenced to confinement. In any case
18 in which a court-martial sentences a person referred to in paragraph (3)
19 of this subsection to confinement, the convening authority may defer
20 the service of the sentence to confinement, without the consent of that
21 person, until after the person has been permanently released to the
22 state military forces by a state or foreign country referred to in that
23 paragraph.
24 (3) Covered persons. Paragraph (2) of this subsection applies to a per-
25 son subject to this chapter who, while in the custody of a state or for-
26 eign country, is temporarily returned by that state or foreign country
27 to the state military forces for trial by court-martial and, after the
28 court-martial, is returned to that state or foreign country under the
29 authority of a mutual agreement or treaty, as the case may be.
30 (4) State defined. In this subsection, the term "state" includes the
31 District of Columbia and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of
32 the United States.
33 (5) Deferral while review pending. In any case in which a court-martial
34 sentences a person to confinement, but in which review of the case is
35 pending, the secretary concerned may defer further service of the sen-
36 tence to confinement while that review is pending.
37 (c) Appellate review.
38 (1) Completion of appellate review. Appellate review is complete under
39 this article when a review under this code is completed or a review is
40 completed by the Idaho state courts in accordance with the applicable
41 rules of procedure of the Idaho state courts.
42 (2) Completion as final judgment of legality of proceedings. The com-
43 pletion of appellate review shall constitute a final judgment as to the
44 legality of the proceedings.
45 ARTICLE 58. EXECUTION OF CONFINEMENT
46 (a) A sentence of confinement adjudged by a court-martial, whether or
47 not the sentence includes discharge or dismissal, and whether or not the dis-
48 charge or dismissal has been executed, may be carried into execution by con-

38
1 finement in any place authorized by this code. Persons so confined are sub-
2 ject to the same discipline and treatment as persons regularly confined or
3 committed to that place of confinement.
4 (b) The omission of "hard labor" as a sentence authorized under this
5 code does not deprive the state confinement facility from employing it, if it
6 otherwise is within the authority of that facility to do so.
7 (c) No place of confinement may require payment of any fee or charge for
8 so receiving or confining a person except as otherwise provided by law.
9 ARTICLE 58a. SENTENCES -- REDUCTION IN ENLISTED GRADE
10 (a) A court-martial sentence of an enlisted member in a pay grade above
11 E-1, as set forth in the judgment of the court-martial entered into the
12 record, includes:
13 (1) A dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge;
14 (2) Confinement; or
15 (3) Reduction of that member to pay grade E-1, if such a reduction is
16 authorized by regulation prescribed by the governor or his designated
17 representative. The reduction in pay grade shall take effect on the
18 date on which the judgment is so entered.
19 (b) If the sentence of a member who is reduced in pay grade under sub-
20 section (a) of this article is set aside or reduced, or, as finally affirmed,
21 does not include any punishment named in subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this ar-
22 ticle, the rights and privileges of which the person was deprived because of
23 that reduction shall be restored, including pay and allowances.
24 ARTICLE 58b. SENTENCES -- FORFEITURE OF
25 PAY AND ALLOWANCES DURING CONFINEMENT
26 (a) Generally.
27 (1) A court-martial sentence described in paragraph (2) of this subsec-
28 tion shall result in the forfeiture of pay, or of pay and allowances, due
29 that member during any period of confinement or parole. The forfeiture
30 pursuant to this article shall take effect on the date determined under
31 this code and may be deferred as provided by this code. The pay and al-
32 lowances forfeited, in the case of a general court-martial, shall be all
33 pay and allowances due that member during such period and, in the case of
34 a special court-martial, shall be two-thirds (2/3) of all pay due that
35 member during such period.
36 (2) A sentence covered by this article is any sentence that includes:

41 thority or other person acting under article 60 of this code may waive any
42 or all of the forfeitures of pay and allowances required by subsection (a)
43 of this article for a period not to exceed six (6) months. Any amount of pay
44 or allowances that, except for a waiver under this subsection, would be for-
45 feited shall be paid, as the convening authority or other person taking ac-
46 tion directs, to the dependents of the accused.

39
1 (c) If the sentence of a member who forfeits pay and allowances under
2 subsection (a) of this article is set aside or disapproved or, as finally ap-
3 proved, does not provide for a punishment referred to in subsection (a)(2) of
4 this article, the member shall be paid the pay and allowances which the mem-
5 ber would have been paid, except for the forfeiture, for the period during
6 which the forfeiture was in effect.
7 PART IX. POSTTRIAL PROCEDURE AND REVIEW OF COURTS-MARTIAL
8 ARTICLE 59. ERROR OF LAW -- LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE

7 guilty with respect to the charge or specification by the members of the
8 court-martial, or by a judge in a bench trial so long as it is not made in
9 reconsideration:
