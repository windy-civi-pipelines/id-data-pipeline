29 tax return and for whom no credit or refund is allowed under any other subsec-
30 tion of this section shall, subject to the limitations of subsections (3),
31 (4), (5), (6), and (7) and (8) of this section, be entitled to a refund in the
32 amount provided in subsection (1) of this section.
33 (3) A resident individual who has reached his sixty-fifth birthday be-
34 fore the end of his taxable year and who has claimed the credit available un-
35 der subsection (1) of this section, in addition to the amount of credit or
36 refund due under subsection (1) of this section, shall be entitled to twenty
37 dollars ($20.00), which shall be claimed as a credit against any taxes due

39 allowed, the individual shall be paid a refund equal to the balance of the un-
40 used credit.
2

3 whom a personal exemption is claimed is a resident of the state of Idaho.

5 or refund for the same personal exemption, or under more than one (1) subsec-
6 tion of this section.

8 vidual for whom assistance under the federal food stamp program was received
9 for any month or part of a month during the taxable year for which the credit
10 or refund is claimed, the credit or refund allowed under this section shall
11 be in proportion to the number of months of the year in which no assistance
12 was received.

31 copies of sales tax receipts of qualifying food purchases along with the tax
32 return or application. If taxes due are less than the total credit allowed,

2 credit or refund under this section is available only if the individual for
3 whom a personal exemption is claimed is a resident of the state of Idaho.

5 or refund for the same personal exemption, or under more than one (1) subsec-

9 for any month or part of a month during the taxable year for which the credit

24 visions of this section must be filed with the state tax commission within
