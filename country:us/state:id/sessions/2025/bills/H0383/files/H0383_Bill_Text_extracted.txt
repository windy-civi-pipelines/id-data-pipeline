32 signed library duties if applicable, and the student's parent or guardian
33 and shall describe the reading intervention services the student will re-
34 ceive to remedy the reading deficit. Each student must receive intensive
35 reading intervention until the student is determined to be proficient in
36 reading for the student's grade level.
37 (a) Having made a good faith effort, should the school be unable to en-
38 gage the parent or guardian in the development of the student's reading
39 improvement plan within fifteen (15) days of notifying the parent, the
40 school may move forward with the creation of the student's reading im-
41 provement plan without parental participation.
42 (b) Any student who has been identified as not proficient through a
43 local literacy formative assessment may also be put on a reading im-
44 provement plan.
45 (c) Students who are on a reading improvement plan and have been identi-
46 fied through the statewide summative assessment to be at grade level may

12 the student; and
13 (iii) A description of the available reading intervention and sup-
14 plemental instructional services and supports that could be pro-
15 vided to the student that are designed to address the identified
16 areas of reading deficiency.
17 (b) Following development of the plan, the parent will be provided
18 with:
19 (i) A description of the reading intervention and supplemental
20 instructional services and support that will be provided to the
21 student that are designed to address the identified areas of read-
22 ing deficiency; and
23 (ii) Strategies for parents to use at home in helping their stu-
24 dent to succeed in reading.

22 In applying these tables to any given separate attendance unit, no
23 school district shall receive less total money than it would receive if it
24 had a lesser average daily attendance in such separate attendance unit. In
25 applying the kindergarten table to a kindergarten program of fewer days
26 than a full school year, the support unit allowance shall be in ratio to the
27 number of days of a full school year. The attendance of students attending
28 an alternative school in a school district reporting fewer than one hundred
29 (100) secondary students in average daily attendance shall not be assigned
30 to the alternative table if the student is from a school district reporting
31 fewer than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance,
32 but shall instead be assigned to the secondary table of the school district
33 in which they are attending the alternative school, unless the alternative
34 school in question serves students from multiple districts reporting fewer
35 than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance. The
36 tables for exceptional education and alternative school support units shall
37 be applicable only for programs approved by the state department of educa-
38 tion following rules established by the state board of education. Moneys
39 generated from computation of support units for alternative schools shall be
40 utilized for alternative school programs. School district administrative
41 and facility costs may be included as part of the alternative school expen-
42 ditures.
15
1 (5) State Distribution Factor per Support Unit. Divide educational
2 support program distribution funds, after subtracting the amounts necessary
3 to pay the obligations specified in subsection (2) of this section, by the
4 total state support units to secure the state distribution factor per sup-
5 port unit.
6 (6) District Support Units. The number of support units for each school
7 district in the state shall be determined as follows:
8 (a)(i) Divide the actual average daily attendance, excluding stu-
9 dents approved for inclusion in the exceptional child educational
10 program for the administrative schools and each of the separate
11 schools and attendance units, by the appropriate divisor from the
12 tables of support units in this section, then add the quotients
13 to obtain the district's support units allowance for regular stu-
14 dents, kindergarten through grade 12 including alternative school
15 students. Calculations in application of this subsection shall be
16 carried out to the nearest hundredth.
17 (ii) Divide the combined totals of the average daily attendance
18 of all preschool, kindergarten, elementary, secondary, juvenile
19 detention center students and students with disabilities approved
20 for inclusion in the exceptional child program of the district by
21 the appropriate divisor from the table for computation of excep-
22 tional education support units to obtain the number of support
23 units allowed for the district's approved exceptional child pro-
24 gram. Calculations for this subsection shall be carried out to the
25 nearest hundredth when more than one (1) unit is allowed.
26 (iii) The total number of support units of the district shall be
27 the sum of the total support units for regular students, subpara-
28 graph (i) of this paragraph, and the support units allowance for
29 the approved exceptional child program, subparagraph (ii) of this
30 paragraph.
31 (b) Total District Allowance Educational Program. Multiply the dis-
32 trict's total number of support units, carried out to the nearest hun-
33 dredth, by the state distribution factor per support unit and to this
34 product add the approved amount of programs of the district provided in
35 subsection (2) of this section to secure the district's total allowance
36 for the educational support program.
37 (c) District Share. The district's share of state apportionment is the
38 amount of the total district allowance, paragraph (b) of this subsec-
39 tion.
40 (d) Adjustment of District Share. The contract salary of every noncer-
41 tificated teacher shall be subtracted from the district's share as cal-
42 culated from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this subsection.
43 (7) Property Tax Computation Ratio. In order to receive state funds
44 pursuant to this section, a charter district shall utilize a school mainte-
45 nance and operation property tax computation ratio for the purpose of calcu-
46 lating its maintenance and operation levy that is no greater than that which
47 it utilized in tax year 1994, less four-tenths of one percent (.4%). As used
48 herein, the term "property tax computation ratio" shall mean a ratio deter-
49 mined by dividing the district's certified property tax maintenance and op-
50 eration budget by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment pur-
16
1 poses as such values existed on December 31, 1993. Such maintenance and op-
2 eration levy shall be based on the property tax computation ratio multiplied
3 by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment purposes as such values
4 existed on December 31 of the prior calendar year.
5 SECTION 10. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
6 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
7 July 1, 2025.

38 gage the parent or guardian in the development of the student's reading
39 improvement plan within fifteen (15) days of notifying the parent, the
40 school may move forward with the creation of the student's reading im-
41 provement plan without parental participation.
42 (b) Any student who has been identified as not proficient through a
43 local literacy formative assessment may also be put on a reading im-
44 provement plan.

10 personnel, and the parent or guardian;
11 (ii) A description of the current services that are provided to
12 the student; and
13 (iii) A description of the available reading intervention and sup-
14 plemental instructional services and supports that could be pro-
15 vided to the student that are designed to address the identified
16 areas of reading deficiency.

27 be done in the local school districts by individuals chosen by the district
28 other than the regular classroom teacher. All those who administer the as-
29 sessments shall be trained by the state department of education.
30 (5) It is the legislature's intent that curricular materials utilized
31 by school districts for kindergarten through grade 3 shall be tied to the
32 science of reading and evidence-based best practices and aligned with the

14 intervention tools independent from the summative assessment. Online
15 or digital instructional materials that are not part of a comprehensive
16 program do not have to be from the approved provider list.
17 (3)(a) The Subject to appropriation, the state board of education shall
18 select and purchase licenses for districts to use for adaptive learning
19 technology literacy intervention providers through a an open request
20 for proposals process to provide adaptive learning technology liter-
21 acy intervention tools for school districts and charter schools to use

32 use of an interactive and adaptive computer software program.
33 (b) To remain on the approved provider list after the first year of
34 identification, programs must shall be evaluated each year every three
35 (3) years to determine effectiveness by an independent external eval-
36 uator. The evaluation will shall be based on a full academic year of
37 implementation of tools implemented with fidelity and will shall in-
38 clude, at a minimum, growth toward proficiency measures. A provider
39 does not need to have a minimum number of students to be evaluated. How-
40 ever, if the Idaho data is not sufficient for evaluation, the provider
41 may be compelled to provide additional evidence of efficacy based on
42 data from other similarly situated students. Providers shall be al-
43 lowed to submit a proposal at any time throughout the year.
44 (4) The state board of education shall identify national evi-
45 dence-based best practices and proven effective state intervention prac-
46 tices. The state department of education shall share state board of educa-

22 In applying these tables to any given separate attendance unit, no
23 school district shall receive less total money than it would receive if it
24 had a lesser average daily attendance in such separate attendance unit. In
25 applying the kindergarten table to a kindergarten program of fewer days
26 than a full school year, the support unit allowance shall be in ratio to the
27 number of days of a full school year. The attendance of students attending
28 an alternative school in a school district reporting fewer than one hundred
29 (100) secondary students in average daily attendance shall not be assigned
30 to the alternative table if the student is from a school district reporting
31 fewer than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance,
32 but shall instead be assigned to the secondary table of the school district
33 in which they are attending the alternative school, unless the alternative
34 school in question serves students from multiple districts reporting fewer
35 than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance. The
36 tables for exceptional education and alternative school support units shall
37 be applicable only for programs approved by the state department of educa-
38 tion following rules established by the state board of education. Moneys
39 generated from computation of support units for alternative schools shall be
40 utilized for alternative school programs. School district administrative
41 and facility costs may be included as part of the alternative school expen-
42 ditures.

15
1 (5) State Distribution Factor per Support Unit. Divide educational
2 support program distribution funds, after subtracting the amounts necessary
3 to pay the obligations specified in subsection (2) of this section, by the
4 total state support units to secure the state distribution factor per sup-
5 port unit.
6 (6) District Support Units. The number of support units for each school
7 district in the state shall be determined as follows:
8 (a)(i) Divide the actual average daily attendance, excluding stu-
9 dents approved for inclusion in the exceptional child educational
10 program for the administrative schools and each of the separate
11 schools and attendance units, by the appropriate divisor from the
12 tables of support units in this section, then add the quotients
13 to obtain the district's support units allowance for regular stu-
14 dents, kindergarten through grade 12 including alternative school
15 students. Calculations in application of this subsection shall be
16 carried out to the nearest hundredth.
17 (ii) Divide the combined totals of the average daily attendance
18 of all preschool, kindergarten, elementary, secondary, juvenile
19 detention center students and students with disabilities approved
20 for inclusion in the exceptional child program of the district by
21 the appropriate divisor from the table for computation of excep-
22 tional education support units to obtain the number of support
23 units allowed for the district's approved exceptional child pro-
24 gram. Calculations for this subsection shall be carried out to the
25 nearest hundredth when more than one (1) unit is allowed.
26 (iii) The total number of support units of the district shall be
27 the sum of the total support units for regular students, subpara-
28 graph (i) of this paragraph, and the support units allowance for
29 the approved exceptional child program, subparagraph (ii) of this
30 paragraph.
31 (b) Total District Allowance Educational Program. Multiply the dis-
32 trict's total number of support units, carried out to the nearest hun-
33 dredth, by the state distribution factor per support unit and to this
34 product add the approved amount of programs of the district provided in
35 subsection (2) of this section to secure the district's total allowance
36 for the educational support program.
37 (c) District Share. The district's share of state apportionment is the
38 amount of the total district allowance, paragraph (b) of this subsec-
39 tion.
40 (d) Adjustment of District Share. The contract salary of every noncer-
41 tificated teacher shall be subtracted from the district's share as cal-
42 culated from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this subsection.
43 (7) Property Tax Computation Ratio. In order to receive state funds
44 pursuant to this section, a charter district shall utilize a school mainte-
45 nance and operation property tax computation ratio for the purpose of calcu-
46 lating its maintenance and operation levy that is no greater than that which
47 it utilized in tax year 1994, less four-tenths of one percent (.4%). As used
48 herein, the term "property tax computation ratio" shall mean a ratio deter-
49 mined by dividing the district's certified property tax maintenance and op-
50 eration budget by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment pur-

16
1 poses as such values existed on December 31, 1993. Such maintenance and op-
2 eration levy shall be based on the property tax computation ratio multiplied
3 by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment purposes as such values
4 existed on December 31 of the prior calendar year.
5 SECTION 10. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
6 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
7 July 1, 2025.
