11 67-2362. DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY LEGISLATIVE TASK
12 FORCE. (1) The state of Idaho recognizes the importance of efficient and
13 responsible governance to best serve the interests of Idaho's citizens.
14 Government inefficiencies, redundancies, and regulatory burdens contribute
15 to unnecessary costs and operational delays and hinder economic growth and
16 effective public service. Proper oversight of state agencies and public
17 expenditures is necessary to ensure fiscal responsibility, prevent waste,
18 and enhance accountability. Therefore, a dedicated legislative task force
19 is necessary to review agency functions, regulatory processes, and budget
20 authority to uphold Idaho's commitment to effective governance.
21 (2) No later than July 1, 2025, the legislature shall form a department
22 of government efficiency (DOGE) legislative task force that shall consist of
23 nine (9) members as follows:
24 (a) Three (3) members of the house of representatives appointed by the
25 speaker of the house of representatives;
26 (b) Three (3) members of the senate appointed by the president pro tem-
27 pore of the senate; and
28 (c) Three (3) legislative members from the joint finance-appropria-
29 tions committee to be appointed by the cochairs of the joint finance-ap-
30 propriations committee. Of these members, one (1) shall be a member of
31 the house of representatives, one (1) shall be a member of the senate,
32 and the third shall be a member of either the house of representatives or
33 the senate.
34 (3) Initial DOGE task force members shall be appointed by July 1, 2025,
35 and shall serve until November 30, 2026. Thereafter, DOGE task force mem-
36 bers shall serve one (1) year terms. After the initial term, DOGE task force
37 members shall be appointed annually on or before November 30 each year. Task
38 force members may be reappointed. The task force shall retain the membership
39 composition described in subsection (2) of this section for the duration of
40 its existence.
41 (4) One (1) member appointed by the speaker of the house of representa-
42 tives shall serve as a cochair of the DOGE task force, and one (1) member ap-

2
1 pointed by the president pro tempore of the senate shall serve as the other
2 cochair.
3 (5) The task force shall meet at least twice a year and may be called
4 for special meetings by the cochairs of the task force. Five (5) members
5 shall constitute a quorum. Members of the task force shall be compensated as
6 provided by the citizens' committee on legislative compensation in the same
7 manner as interim legislative meetings, which compensation shall be paid
8 from the legislative account.
9 (6) The DOGE task force may appoint up to two (2) nonlegislative advi-
10 sors with technical expertise to assist the committee in efficiently con-
11 ducting and completing its business. Nonlegislative advisors shall not be
12 reimbursed from legislative funds for per diem, mileage, or other expenses,
13 and shall not have voting privileges regarding the DOGE task force's recom-
14 mendations or proposed legislation.
15 (7) The DOGE task force is authorized to study and review governmental
16 efficiency matters pertaining to the state of Idaho in general in order to
17 determine, as applicable, how the legislature may be able to ensure fiscal
18 responsibility, prevent waste, and enhance accountability.
19 (8) The DOGE task force may divide its work into three (3) subgroups to
20 focus on specific areas of government efficiency:
21 (a) A regulatory accountability subgroup, which shall focus on evalu-
22 ating ways to strengthen oversight of state agency rulemaking and mak-
23 ing recommendations to ensure Idaho's leadership in regulatory reduc-
24 tion, with a goal of eliminating or shifting nearly all regulations to
25 statute by 2033;
26 (b) A budget accountability subgroup, which shall focus on conducting
27 base budget reviews, identifying opportunities to eliminate wasteful
28 or redundant government services, programs, and expenditures, and mak-
29 ing recommendations to further strengthen budget processes; and
30 (c) A government operations and oversight subgroup, which shall focus
31 on assessing the structure of state government and recommending agency
32 consolidations or streamlining efforts to optimize efficiency and en-
33 sure services are administered by the most appropriate agencies.
34 (9) The DOGE task force shall from time to time advise the legislature
35 of its findings and recommendations. A copy of any reports, findings, or
36 proposed legislation shall be submitted to the legislative services office
37 electronically. Any subgroup of the DOGE task force shall report any re-
38 ports, findings, or proposed legislation to the DOGE task force as a whole.
39 (10) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the
40 task force, acting through the cochairs, may utilize staff and resources
41 within state government. The task force shall make use of technology
42 resources, including artificial intelligence, whenever doing so would in-
43 crease the DOGE task force's efficiency.
44 (11) The task force shall operate until November 30, 2029. Thereafter,
45 the DOGE task force shall be dissolved and the provisions of this section
46 shall become null, void, and of no further force and effect.
47 SECTION 2. The provisions of Section 1 of this act shall be null, void
48 and of no force and effect on and after December 1, 2029.

3
1 SECTION 3. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
2 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after its
3 passage and approval.
