20 mother certifying that the pregnancy resulting in such preborn child was di-
21 agnosed as occurring during the tax year and did not result in a delivery to
22 term within the same tax year. In the case of a preborn child of a mother
23 who is also a dependent, the tax credit provided under this section may be
24 claimed by either such dependent or, if not claimed by the dependent, the
25 person who is claiming the dependent on such person's tax return. In no event

34 and the qualifying child is in the custody of one or both of the child's par-
35 ents for more than one-half of a calendar year, such child is the qualifying
36 child of the custodial parent for the taxable year beginning during such cal-
37 endar year. However, the child may be the qualifying child of the noncusto-
38 dial parent if either of the following requirements are met:
39 (a) A court of competent jurisdiction has unconditionally awarded, in
40 writing, to the noncustodial parent the tax benefits associated with
41 the child pursuant to section 32-706, Idaho Code, and the noncustodial
2
1 parent attaches a copy of the court order to the noncustodial parent's
2 income tax return for the taxable year; or
3 (b) The custodial parent signs a written declaration that such custo-
4 dial parent will not claim the credit of this section with respect to
5 such child for any taxable year beginning in such calendar year and the
6 noncustodial parent attaches such written declaration to the noncusto-
7 dial parent's income tax return for the taxable year beginning during
8 such calendar year.
9 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
10 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after its
