23 SECTION 1. COMMUNITY-BASED RECOVERY CENTERS. Of the moneys appro-
24 priated to the Department of Health and Welfare for the Substance Abuse
25 Treatment and Prevention Program from the Idaho Millennium Income Fund in
26 Section 1 of Senate Bill No. 1108 as enacted by the First Regular Session of
27 the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, $1,350,000 shall be distributed for the
28 purpose of continued funding to eligible community-based recovery centers.
29 "Community-based recovery center" means a not-for-profit organization with
30 an oversight advisory board and a verifiable physical location where sup-
31 port services are provided to Idahoans at no cost or at very limited cost
32 based on ability to pay, that operates at least twenty-five (25) consistent
33 hours each week, and that has sufficient square footage for walk-in visits
34 and group activities for recovery support. Services provided may include
35 peer-to-peer support, job training, recovery support to reduce substance
36 use, recovery coaching, and references to other community-based recovery
37 services. Funds shall be used by the community-based recovery centers to
38 support the operations of the center, including but not limited to per-
39 sonnel costs, rent or lease expenses, basic supplies, and other operating
40 costs. Community-based recovery centers shall provide to the Department
41 of Health and Welfare a document that demonstrates operational and fiscal
42 accountability for the center. Community-based recovery centers shall work
43 in partnership with the Department of Health and Welfare and sign an at-

2
1 testation letter or equivalent document that ensures funds will be used in
2 accordance with this section, with Section 2 of this act, and with any other
3 applicable rule or law, and that all moneys received will be accounted for
4 using generally accepted accounting principles. Funding is allocated for
5 eligible centers for the cities of Boise, Caldwell or Nampa, Emmett, Twin
6 Falls, Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Moscow, Lewiston, and Coeur d'Alene.
7 SECTION 2. COMMUNITY-BASED RECOVERY CENTERS OVERSIGHT. (1) The De-
8 partment of Health and Welfare shall provide oversight for the appropriated
9 funds provided in Section 1 of this act for community-based recovery cen-
10 ters. The Department of Health and Welfare shall:
11 (a) Provide four distributions of $37,500 for a total distribution of
12 $150,000 to each eligible center. Distributions shall occur no later
13 than July 15, 2025, October 15, 2025, January 15, 2026, and April 15,
14 2026;
15 (b) Receive and compile two reports from each center and transmit each
16 report to the Budget and Policy Analysis Division of the Legislative
17 Services Office on behalf of the Joint Millennium Fund Committee by
18 December 30, 2025, and by June 30, 2026, or as soon thereafter as is
19 practicable. The format of the report and the content therein shall be
20 developed by the department and approved by the Budget and Policy Analy-
21 sis Division of the Legislative Services Office;
22 (c) Withhold or recover distributions pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
23 subsection if the center is not operating or has indicated it intends to
24 no longer operate prior to the close of the fiscal year, if it does not
25 provide any of the required reports, or otherwise as needed to address
26 legal or fiscal concerns regarding funds provided to a center. The
27 department shall notify the center immediately with detailed informa-
28 tion on identified concerns and potential amounts subject to recovery.
29 Amounts subject to withholding or recovery shall be based on the time
30 frame in question; and
31 (d) Assist each center, as needed, to ensure services are being pro-
32 vided as intended by this act and to meet the needs of that local commu-
33 nity.
34 (2) The Department of Health and Welfare shall not have the authority to
35 directly manage any center or direct any center to perform functions not re-
36 quired in this section or Section 1 of this act. If the Department of Health
37 and Welfare has reason to believe that appropriated funds are used in viola-
38 tion of this section or Section 1 of this act or any other rule or law, the
39 department shall immediately notify the center in question, the Budget and
40 Policy Analysis Division of the Legislative Services Office, and the Execu-
41 tive Office of the Governor of any misuse or perceived misuse of funds. The
42 Department of Health and Welfare shall work collaboratively with such cen-
43 ter and the Executive Office of the Governor to develop an appropriate cor-
44 rective action plan. If funds were withheld pursuant to Subsection (1)(c)
45 of this Section while a center made necessary adjustments according to the
46 corrective action plan and the center continued operations according to the
47 provisions of this act, then the department shall provide any withheld fund-
48 ing no later than 30 days upon completion of the corrective action plan.

3
1 (3) Should any of the community-based recovery centers as defined in
2 Section 1 of this act cease to operate or not be operational in accordance
3 with the requirements of this section and Section 1 of this act within 30 days
4 of any quarterly distribution date identified in this Section, the State
5 Controller, at the request of the Department of Health and Welfare, shall
6 transfer any quarterly distribution moneys back to the Idaho Millennium
7 Income Fund as soon as practicable. If a delay occurs as a result of action
8 or inaction by the Department of Health and Welfare, funds shall be retained
9 until such time that a payment can be made to an eligible center or it can
10 be determined that a center will no longer be able to operate. A decision
11 to no longer operate requires agreement from the identified center, the De-
12 partment of Health and Welfare, and the Executive Office of the Governor. If
13 a resolution is not reached by the end of the fiscal year, all moneys shall
14 be returned to the Idaho Millennium Income Fund and adequate documentation
15 shall be independently provided by the center and the Department of Health
16 and Welfare to the Budget and Policy Analysis Division of the Legislative
17 Services Office no later than 30 days after the end of the fiscal year docu-
18 menting why a resolution could not be reached.
19 SECTION 3. ESTABLISHING A NEW COMMUNITY-BASED RECOVERY CENTER. (1) If
20 any of the nine cities identified in Section 1 of this act does not have an
21 approved center by no later than 14 days after a payment date identified in
22 Section 2 of this act and it does not appear that a previously existing center
23 for that city will be operational with the conditions set forth in this act,
24 the Department of Health and Welfare shall allow eligible organizations to
25 apply through a competitive application process. The Department of Health
26 and Welfare, a representative from that city's regional behavioral health
27 board or representative from the Executive Office of the Governor if a re-
28 gional behavioral health board is not operational, and a representative from
29 that city's regional public health district shall review each application
30 and select the most qualified organization to operate a community-based re-
31 covery center for that city. The Department of Health and Welfare shall im-
32 mediately notify the Budget and Policy Analysis Division of the Legislative
33 Services Office of the selected organization chosen to operate the center.
34 Funds may be provided to a new center if it is selected and operational within
35 45 days after a distribution date provided for in Section 2 of this act. If
36 a center is not operational within 45 days, then funds related to that quar-
37 terly distribution shall be transferred back to the Idaho Millennium Income
38 Fund by the State Controller as soon as practicable at the request of the De-
39 partment of Health and Welfare. Should a qualified applicant not be selected
40 to operate the center, then all appropriated funds that are allocated for
41 that center shall be transferred back to the Idaho Millennium Income Fund by
42 the State Controller at the request of the Department of Health and Welfare
43 no later than 30 days after the date identified for the fourth quarterly dis-
44 tribution.
45 (2) If the Department of Health and Welfare has received interest to es-
46 tablish an additional center or replace one of the current nine regional cen-
47 ters due to a lack of qualified options, the department shall make an offi-
48 cial request to the Idaho Legislature by including an enhancement request in
49 its fiscal year 2027 budget request submitted to the Legislature and the Gov-

4
1 ernor. A formal presentation shall be made to the Joint Legislative Millen-

3 mittee.

8 riod July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026. The Office of the State Controller
9 shall confirm the reappropriation amount, by fund, expense class, and pro-
10 gram, with the Legislative Services Office prior to processing the reappro-
11 priation authorized herein.
12 SECTION 12. USES OF THE IDAHO MILLENNIUM INCOME FUND. The Joint Millen-
13 nium Fund Committee, pursuant to Section 67-1808(6), Idaho Code, recommends
14 that all moneys available for appropriation from the Idaho Millennium Income
15 Fund beginning in fiscal year 2024 and each year thereafter be prioritized
16 for programs that focus on prevention, cessation, and treatment related to
17 tobacco, vape, alcohol, illegal substances, and other substances that may be
18 abused beyond the intended uses and for the overall safety and well-being of
19 Idaho youth. Funding should be prioritized first to programs that benefit
20 Idahoans under 18 years of age and then for adults with higher risk factors
21 for abusing or using various substances described in this section. It is the
22 recommendation of the Joint Millennium Fund Committee that no moneys from
23 the Idaho Millennium Income Fund be used for the payment of Medicaid claims.
24 In accordance with the priorities of this section, any requested funds not
25 already an ongoing appropriation in fiscal year 2026 shall be presented in
26 the Legislative Budget Book as a request for new onetime appropriation in the
27 Idaho Millennium Fund Program and not in the respective agency budgets. Con-
28 sistent with Section 67-1806, Idaho Code, the Joint Millennium Fund Commit-
29 tee shall be responsible for the official recommendation on the uses of the
30 Idaho Millennium Income Fund.
31 SECTION 13. CONDITIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND RESTRICTIONS. Appropriations
32 made pursuant to this act are subject to the conditions, limitations, and re-
33 strictions specified in this act.
34 SECTION 14. In addition to the appropriation made in Section 1, Chap-
35 ter 211, Laws of 2024, and any other appropriation provided by law, there is
36 hereby appropriated to the Department of Juvenile Corrections for the Com-
37 munity, Operations, and Program Services Program $1,291,000 from the Idaho
38 Millennium Income Fund to be expended for trustee and benefit payments for
39 the period July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025.
40 SECTION 15. YOUTH ASSESSMENT CENTERS. (1) Any moneys appropriated from
41 the Idaho Millennium Income Fund to the Department of Juvenile Corrections
42 for youth assessment centers shall be considered a onetime appropriation
43 with no expectation of future financial support.
44 (2) In order for a youth assessment center to receive moneys from the
45 Idaho Millennium Income Fund, the center shall provide a detailed sustain-
46 ability plan that demonstrates how that center can remain operational with-

6
1 out reliance on state funds. Each plan shall include documentation stat-
2 ing financial commitments for ongoing financial support for the center. The
3 sustainability plan shall be submitted to the Department of Juvenile Cor-
4 rections and the Budget and Policy Analysis Division of the Legislative Ser-
5 vices Office prior to the Department of Juvenile Corrections distributing
6 any moneys.
7 (3) Funding shall be distributed to eligible youth assessment centers
8 based on criteria set forth by the Department of Juvenile Corrections. Fund-
9 ing for the period July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025, shall be distributed
10 to eligible centers as soon as practicable. Funding for the period July 1,
11 2025, through June 30, 2026, shall be distributed in two distributions with
12 the first distribution to occur no later than July 15, 2025, and the second
13 distribution to occur no later than December 1, 2025. Funding determina-
14 tions made by the Department of Juvenile Corrections shall be considered fi-
15 nal.
16 (4) Each youth assessment center that receives moneys from the Idaho
17 Millennium Income Fund shall sign an attestation letter or equivalent doc-
18 ument that demonstrates how distributed moneys will be used in accordance
19 with this section and with any other applicable rule or law, that confirms
20 that all moneys received will be accounted for using generally accepted
21 accounting principles, and that demonstrates how the center will maintain
22 operational and fiscal accountability throughout the year. This informa-
23 tion shall be provided to the Department of Juvenile Corrections and the
24 Budget and Policy Analysis Division of the Legislative Services Office prior
25 to the Department of Juvenile Corrections distributing any moneys. Each
26 center must maintain adequate records for revenue and expenditure verifi-
27 cation. If a center that receives moneys from the Idaho Millennium Income
28 Fund ceases operations between the effective date of this section and June
29 30, 2026, that center shall immediately notify the Department of Juvenile
30 Corrections and the Budget and Policy Analysis Division of the Legislative
31 Services Office and shall return all unexpended moneys to the Department of
32 Juvenile Corrections as soon as practicable.
33 (5) Each youth assessment center that receives moneys from the Idaho
34 Millennium Income Fund shall provide reports demonstrating the State's re-
35 turn on investment for moneys provided, including data-driven results on the
36 success of the center. A uniform report template shall be created by a coali-
37 tion of members that represent various youth assessment centers around the
38 state, and all centers shall submit reports according to the template. The
39 initial report shall be provided to the Budget and Policy Analysis Division
40 of the Legislative Services Office and the Department of Juvenile Correc-
41 tions no later than September 1, 2025, and the updated report shall be sub-
42 mitted no later than June 1, 2026.
43 (6) If the Joint Millennium Fund Committee determines that an indepen-
44 dent audit is needed, then such an audit is required and will occur at the ex-
45 pense of the associated center.
46 (7) If any center determines that future state funding may be neces-
47 sary, that center shall submit a request to the Idaho Behavioral Health Coun-
48 cil by a date determined by the council, and such date shall be posted on the
49 council's website. Each youth assessment center request shall include de-
50 tails on the funding amount needed, intended purposes, proposed solutions to

7
1 maximize non-state resources to sustain operations on an ongoing basis, and
2 any other criteria determined by the Idaho Behavioral Health Council.
3 SECTION 16. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
4 declared to exist, Sections 14 and 15 of this act shall be in full force and
5 effect on and after passage and approval, and Sections 1 through 13 of this
6 act shall be in full force and effect on and after July 1, 2025.
