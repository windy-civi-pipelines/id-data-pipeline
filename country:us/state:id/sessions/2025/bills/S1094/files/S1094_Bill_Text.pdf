5 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
6 SECTION 1. That Section 33-802, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
7 amended to read as follows:
8 33-802. SCHOOL LEVIES. Any tax levied for school purposes shall be a
9 lien on the property against which the tax is levied. The board of trustees
10 shall determine the levies upon each dollar of taxable property in the dis-
11 trict for the ensuing fiscal year as follows:
12 (1) Bond, Interest and Judgment Obligation Levies. Such levies as
13 shall be required to satisfy all maturing bond, bond interest, and judgment
14 obligations.
15 (2) Budget Stabilization Levies. School districts not receiving state
16 equalization funds in fiscal year 2006 may authorize a budget stabilization
17 levy for calendar year 2006 and each year thereafter. Such levies shall not
18 exceed the difference between the amount of equalized funds that the state
19 department of education estimates the school district will receive in fiscal
20 year 2007, based on the school district's fiscal year 2006 reporting data,
21 and the combined amount of money the school district would have received from
22 its maintenance and operation levy and state property tax replacement funds
23 in fiscal year 2007 under the laws of the state of Idaho as they existed prior
24 to amendment by the first extraordinary session of the fifty-eighth Idaho
25 legislature. The state department of education shall notify the state tax
26 commission and affected counties and school districts of the maximum levy
27 amounts permitted, by no later than September 1, 2006.
28 (3) Supplemental Maintenance and Operation Levies. No levy in excess
29 of the levy permitted by this section shall be made by a noncharter district
30 unless such a supplemental levy in a specified amount and for a specified
31 time not to exceed two (2) years, from one (1) year to a maximum of six (6)
32 years, be first authorized through an election held subject to the provi-
33 sions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, and pursuant to title 34, Idaho Code,
34 and approved by a majority of the district electors voting in such election.
35 A levy approved pursuant to this subsection may be reduced by a majority vote
36 of the board of trustees in the second year any of the years in which the levy
37 is authorized.
38 (4) Charter District Supplemental Maintenance and Operation. Levies
39 pursuant to the respective charter of any such charter district shall be
40 first authorized through an election held subject to the provisions of sec-
41 tion 34-106, Idaho Code, and pursuant to title 34, Idaho Code, and approved
42 by a majority of the district electors voting in such election.

2
1 (5) The Any supplemental levy approved by the board of trustees of any
2 school district prior to January 1, 2025, pursuant to this subsection shall
3 continue for its indefinite term. The board of trustees of any school dis-
4 trict that has, for at least seven (7) consecutive years, been authorized
5 through an election held to certify a supplemental levy that has annually
6 been equal to or greater than twenty percent (20%) of the total general main-
7 tenance and operation fund, may submit the question of an indefinite term
8 supplemental levy to the electors of the school district. Such question
9 shall clearly state the dollar amount that will be certified annually and
10 that the levy will be for an indefinite number of years. The question must be
11 approved by a majority of the district electors voting on the question in an
12 election held subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, and
13 pursuant to title 34, Idaho Code. The levy approved pursuant to this sub-
14 section may be reduced by a majority vote of the board of trustees during any
15 fiscal year. Supplemental levies approved pursuant to this subsection shall
16 be valid only if approved prior to January 1, 2025.
17 (6) A charter district may levy for maintenance and operations if such
18 authority is contained within its charter. In the event property within a
19 charter district's boundaries is contained in a revenue allocation area es-
20 tablished under chapter 29, title 50, Idaho Code, and such revenue alloca-
21 tion area has given notice of termination thereunder, then, only for the pur-
22 pose of determining the levy described in this subsection, the district may
23 add the increment value, as defined in section 50-2903, Idaho Code, to the
24 actual or adjusted market value for assessment purposes of the district as
25 such value existed on December 31 of the previous year.
26 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
27 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
28 July 1, 2025.
