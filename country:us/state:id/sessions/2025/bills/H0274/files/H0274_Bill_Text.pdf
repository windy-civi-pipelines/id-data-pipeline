47 non-custodial parent who owes overdue support exceeding two thousand dol-

24 public assistance from any source on behalf of the minor child, and, if
25 so, from which source(s).
26 (5) Upon receipt of a petition or motion, the court shall issue an in-
27 come withholding order pursuant to section 32-1204 or 32-1205, Idaho Code,
28 to the employer utilizing the required income withholding for support form
29 and shall provide a form for an answer to the income withholding order which
30 shall be returned to the court within ten (10) days. The court shall also
31 order the employer to remit the amount withheld to the department of health
32 and welfare within seven (7) business days after the date the amount would
33 have been paid or credited to the obligor. The department shall supply each
34 county with the required income withholding for support form and answers

48 satisfied or until the order is otherwise unenforceable.
