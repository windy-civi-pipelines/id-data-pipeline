7 diagnoses, if applicable, and identify underlying conditions and/or con-
8 traindications to the treatment. A valid prescriber-patient relationship
9 may be established through virtual care technologies, provided that the ap-
10 plicable Idaho community standard of care must be satisfied.

12 dence of alteration by any person other than the person who wrote it.

19 scriber for whom the prescriber is taking call;

31 health including, but not limited to, empiric treatment or prophylaxis
32 to prevent or control an infectious disease outbreak; and

34 patient, prescribe or dispense antimicrobials to an individual who
35 has been exposed to the infectious person in accordance with clinical
36 guidelines.

38 solely on a static online questionnaire does not constitute a legitimate
39 medical purpose.
