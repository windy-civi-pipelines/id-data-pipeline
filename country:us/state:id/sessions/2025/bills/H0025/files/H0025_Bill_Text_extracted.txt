23 this amount certified quarterly to each county. For school districts, the

31 property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602EE, Idaho Code, may
32 be considered by the counties and other taxing districts and budgeted at the

35 consolidated, the resulting district is entitled to an amount equal to the
36 sum of the amounts received in the last calendar quarter by each district
37 pursuant to this subsection prior to the consolidation. If a taxing district
38 is dissolved or disincorporated, the state tax commission shall continu-
39 ously distribute to the board of county commissioners an amount equal to the

17 are consolidated, the resulting district is entitled to an amount equal to
18 the sum of the amounts that were received in the last calendar year by each
19 district pursuant to this subsection prior to the consolidation. If a taxing
20 district or revenue allocation area annexes territory, the distribution of

22 districts and revenue allocation areas formed after January 1, 2022, are not
23 entitled to a payment under the provisions of this subsection.

40 ious cities as follows:
41 (i) The revenue-sharing amount calculated by the state tax com-
42 mission for the various cities for each quarter of fiscal year 2020
43 shall be the base amount for current quarterly revenue distribu-
44 tion amounts. The state tax commission shall calculate the per
45 capita distribution for each city resulting from the previous fis-
46 cal year's distributions.

48 account from the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, then the
49 various cities shall receive the same amount received for the same

2 rent quarter is greater than the balance of the revenue-sharing
3 account for the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, then:
4 1. If the distributions made to the cities during the same
5 quarter of the previous fiscal year were below the base
6 amount established in fiscal year 2020, then the various
7 cities shall first receive a proportional increase up to the
8 base amount for each city and up to a one-percent (1%) in-
9 crease over such base amount. Any remaining moneys shall be
10 distributed to cities with a below-average per capita dis-
11 tribution in the proportion that the population of that city
12 bears to the population of all cities with below-average per
13 capita distributions within the state.
14 2. If the distributions made to the cities during the same
15 quarter of the previous fiscal year were at or above the
16 base amount established in fiscal year 2020, then the cities
17 shall receive the same distribution they received during the
18 same quarter of the previous fiscal year plus a proportional
19 increase up to one percent (1%). Any remaining moneys shall
20 be distributed to the cities with a below-average per capita
21 distribution in the proportion that the population of that
22 city bears to the population of all cities with a below-aver-
23 age per capita distribution within the state.
24 (iv) If the balance of the revenue-sharing account for the cur-
25 rent quarter is less than the balance of the revenue-sharing ac-
26 count for the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, then the
27 cities shall first receive a proportional reduction down to the
28 base amount established in fiscal year 2020. If further reduc-
29 tions are necessary, the cities shall receive reductions based on
30 the proportion that each city's population bears to the population
31 of all cities within the state.
32 (b) Forty-seven and one-tenth percent (47.1%) shall be paid to the var-
33 ious counties as follows:
34 (i) Fifty-nine and eight-tenths percent (59.8%) of the amount to

37 1. One million three hundred twenty thousand dollars
38 ($1,320,000) annually shall be distributed one forty-fourth
39 (1/44) to each of the various counties; and
40 2. The balance of such amount shall be paid to the various
41 counties, and each county shall be entitled to an amount in
42 the proportion that the population of that county bears to
43 the population of the state; and
44 (ii) Forty and two-tenths percent (40.2%) of the amount to be dis-
45 tributed under this paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be dis-
46 tributed as follows:
47 1. Each county that received a payment under the provisions
48 of section 63-3638(e), Idaho Code, as that subsection ex-
49 isted immediately prior to July 1, 2000, during the fourth

4
1 quarter of calendar year 1999, shall be entitled to a like
2 amount during succeeding calendar quarters.
3 2. If the dollar amount of money available under this sub-
4 section (10)(b)(ii) in any quarter does not equal the amount
5 paid in the fourth quarter of calendar year 1999, each
6 county's payment shall be reduced proportionately.
7 3. If the dollar amount of money available under this sub-
8 section (10)(b)(ii) in any quarter exceeds the amount paid
9 in the fourth quarter of calendar year 1999, each county
10 shall be entitled to a proportionately increased payment,
11 but such increase shall not exceed one hundred five percent
12 (105%) of the total payment made in the fourth quarter of
13 calendar year 1999.
14 4. If the dollar amount of money available under this sub-
15 section (10)(b)(ii) in any quarter exceeds one hundred five
16 percent (105%) of the total payment made in the fourth quar-
17 ter of calendar year 1999, any amount over and above such
18 one hundred five percent (105%) shall be paid to the various
19 counties in the proportion that the population of the county
20 bears to the population of the state; and
21 (c) Seven and seven-tenths percent (7.7%) of the amount appropriated in
22 this subsection shall be paid to the several counties for distribution
23 to special purpose taxing districts as follows:
24 (i) Each such district that received a payment under the provi-
25 sions of section 63-3638(e), Idaho Code, as such subsection ex-
26 isted immediately prior to July 1, 2000, during the fourth quarter
27 of calendar year 1999, shall be entitled to a like amount during
28 succeeding calendar quarters.
29 (ii) If the dollar amount of money available under this subsec-
30 tion (10)(c) in any quarter does not equal the amount paid in the
31 fourth quarter of calendar year 1999, each special purpose taxing
32 district's payment shall be reduced proportionately.
33 (iii) If the dollar amount of money available under this subsec-
34 tion (10)(c) in any quarter exceeds the amount distributed under
35 paragraph (c)(i) of this subsection, each special purpose taxing
36 district shall be entitled to a share of the excess based on the
37 proportion each such district's current property tax budget bears
38 to the sum of the current property tax budgets of all such dis-
39 tricts in the state. Each year, starting with the distribution
40 for the quarter ending December 31, the state tax commission shall
41 calculate this distribution based on the district's current prop-
42 erty tax budgets, including any unrecovered forgone amounts as de-
43 termined under section 63-802(1)(e), Idaho Code. When a special
44 purpose taxing district is situated in more than one (1) county,
45 the state tax commission shall determine the portion attributable
46 to the special purpose taxing district from each county in which it
47 is situated.
48 (iv) If special purpose taxing districts are consolidated, the
49 resulting district is entitled to a base amount equal to the sum of

5
1 the base amounts received in the last calendar quarter by each dis-
2 trict prior to the consolidation.
3 (v) If a special purpose taxing district is dissolved or disin-
4 corporated, the state tax commission shall continuously distrib-
5 ute to the board of county commissioners an amount equal to the
6 last quarter's distribution prior to dissolution or disincorpora-
7 tion. The board of county commissioners shall determine any re-
8 distribution of moneys so received.
9 (vi) Taxing districts formed after January 1, 2001, are not en-
10 titled to a payment under the provisions of this paragraph (c) of
11 this subsection.
12 (vii) For purposes of this paragraph (c) of this subsection, a spe-
13 cial purpose taxing district is any taxing district that is not a
14 city, a county, or a school district.
15 (viii) Special purpose taxing districts shall use funds received

23 entitled to a payment under the provisions of this subsection.
