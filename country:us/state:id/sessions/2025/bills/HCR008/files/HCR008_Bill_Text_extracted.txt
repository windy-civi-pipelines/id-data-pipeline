LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 8
BY ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE
1 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
2 STATING FINDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE, REQUESTING CERTAIN STATE AND LOCAL GOV-
3 ERNMENT INVOLVEMENT, AND EXPRESSING OPPOSITION OVER THE BUREAU OF LAND
4 MANAGEMENT'S APPROVAL OF THE LAVA RIDGE WIND ENERGY PROJECT.
5 Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
6 WHEREAS, the Bureau of Land Management has issued a record of decision
7 (ROD) approving the Lava Ridge Wind Energy project, which entails leasing an
8 extensive amount of public land in Jerome, Lincoln, and Minidoka Counties;
9 and
10 WHEREAS, President Trump recently issued an executive order directing
11 that federal leasing and permitting practices for wind energy projects be
12 reviewed; and
13 WHEREAS, the State of Idaho concurs with the executive order's state-
14 ment that the Lava Ridge project is "contrary to the public interest and suf-
15 fers from legal deficiencies"; and
16 WHEREAS, Governor Brad Little stated in his Executive Order 2025-01
17 that "this project has faced overwhelming opposition from Idaho residents
18 and elected officials over its permanent impact on multiple uses, cul-
19 tural and historical sites, including the Minidoka National Historic Site,
20 wildlife, and local economies"; and
21 WHEREAS, Attorney General Raúl Labrador has stated that the "proposal
22 has widespread opposition in Idaho from very diverse groups who don't want
23 massive turbines sprouting up in the Magic Valley"; and
24 WHEREAS, the construction and operation of at least 231 wind turbines,
25 each reaching heights of up to 660 feet, will impact civil, military, and
26 agricultural flight operations; and
27 WHEREAS, because the Magic Valley currently has a shortage of available
28 housing, workforce, and construction capacity, the economy cannot offer the
29 temporary support needed to construct Lava Ridge over the proposed two-year
30 construction period and doing so will further stress local markets and lead
31 to a boom-and-bust economy, a concern which has been rightfully and vehe-
32 mently expressed by local citizens and business; and
33 WHEREAS, the blasting occurring during construction could signifi-
34 cantly damage the fragile subsurface geology containing the Snake River
35 Aquifer, the life blood of Southern Idaho; and
36 WHEREAS, Idaho is required by law to protect all wildlife and this
37 project will severely impact the migration and habitat of local wildlife;
38 and
39 WHEREAS, the lands subject to development under this project are uti-
40 lized by the agriculture industry and the public for recreational activities
41 such as hunting and fishing; and
42 WHEREAS, the State of Idaho will derive little to no benefit from this
43 project; and
2
1 WHEREAS, the energy created by the Lava Ridge project will provide en-
2 ergy to Southern Nevada and California, both of which have tremendous open
3 space that could accommodate this project and more directly move the impacts
4 to the beneficiaries; and
5 WHEREAS, President Trump's executive order does not stop the project
6 but directs the Secretary of the Interior to place a temporary moratorium on
7 the ROD and to conduct a new, comprehensive analysis of various impacts, if
8 the Secretary deems either of those actions to be appropriate.
9 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
10 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives
11 and the Senate concurring therein, that all state agencies fully cooperate
12 with and participate in the potential review process by engaging with local
13 governments and participating in public forums, in accordance with Governor
14 Little's executive order.
15 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature requests that Idaho Attor-
16 ney General Raúl Labrador and Governor Brad Little work to ensure that the
17 Lava Ridge project does not proceed and formally protest and appeal the deci-
18 sion to move forward with the project, if necessary.
19 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature remains opposed to this
20 project and supports the concerns of Idaho and the Magic Valley as justifica-
21 tion to support a no-build option.
