23 6-308. PARTIES DEFENDANT. No person other than the tenant of the
24 premises, and subtenant, if there be one, in the actual occupation of the
25 premises when the notice herein provided for was served, need be made parties
26 defendant in the proceeding, nor shall any proceeding abate nor the plain-

28 parties defendant; but when it appears that any of the parties served with
29 process or appearing in the proceeding are guilty of the offense charged,
30 judgment must be rendered against them. Any person who shall become a sub-
31 tenant of the premises or any part thereof after the service of notice as pro-
32 vided in this chapter shall be bound by the judgment. In case a married woman
33 be a tenant or a subtenant, her coverture shall constitute no defense; but

2 representative, if applicable, specifying the dollar amount of monthly com-
3 pensation to be paid by the resident to the care provider and the monthly date
4 by which payment is due.
5 (2) A dollar amount to be charged to the resident shall be negotiated
6 in the admission agreement for monthly room and board, which includes break-
7 fast, lunch, and dinner offered each day.
8 (3) If any portion of funding for the resident's care is from a pri-
9 vate source, the admission agreement shall include a separately listed dol-
10 lar amount for any monthly care charges for which the resident is responsi-
11 ble. The care provider shall prorate and, if applicable, refund care charges
12 for any day the resident did not receive certified family home services dur-

14 (4) The care provider shall give the resident or resident represen-
15 tative, as appropriate, written notice in accordance with section 55-307
16 55-304, Idaho Code, before changing the terms of the admission agreement.
17 (5) An admission agreement signed by both parties shall remain in ef-
18 fect until one (1) of the following conditions are met:
19 (a) The admission agreement is properly terminated in accordance with
20 Idaho landlord-tenant law; or
21 (b) The care provider is no longer certified by the department.
22 (6) The admission agreement shall include protections that address
23 eviction and appeals comparable to those provided under Idaho landlord-ten-
24 ant law and chapter 3, title 6, Idaho Code.

26 the certified family home's responsibility to provide meals and care, while

28 another care setting on an emergency basis. Provided, as long as the admis-
29 sion agreement remains in effect, the care provider shall allow the resident
30 to resume receiving services in the certified family home after the emer-
31 gency condition has improved enough for the certified family home to provide
32 services in accordance with section 39-3507, Idaho Code.
33 SECTION 3. That Section 55-304, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
34 amended to read as follows:
35 55-304 55-312. RECOVERY OF RENT ON LEASE FOR LIFE. Rent due upon a
36 lease for life may be recovered in the same manner as upon a lease for years.
37 SECTION 4. That Section 55-305, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby

3

3 interest in the property at the commencement of the action.

7 55-306. LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- NO RENT CONTROL. A local governmental unit

10 ipate in an optional federal housing assistance program or any other pro-
11 gram or law that would otherwise regulate rent, fees, or deposits charged for
12 leasing private residential property. The provisions of this section do not
13 impair the right of any local governmental unit to manage and control resi-
14 dential property in which the local governmental unit has a property inter-
15 est.
16 SECTION 7. That Section 55-307, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby

20 from month to month, the landlord may, upon giving notice in writing at least
21 fifteen (15) days before the expiration of the month, change the terms of
22 the lease to take effect at the expiration of the month. The notice, when
23 served upon the tenant, shall of itself operate and be effectual to create
24 and establish, as a part of the lease, the terms, rent and conditions speci-
25 fied in the notice if the tenant shall continue to hold the premises after the
26 expiration of the month.
27 (2) A local governmental unit shall not enact, maintain, or enforce an
28 ordinance or resolution that would have the effect of mandating Idaho prop-
29 erty owners to be forced to participate in an optional federal housing assis-
30 tance program or any other program or law that would otherwise regulate rent,
31 fees, or deposits charged for leasing private residential property. This
32 provision does not impair the right of any local governmental unit to manage
33 and control residential property in which the local governmental unit has a
34 property interest.
35 (3) (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, in all leases
36 of residential property, or of any interest therein, the landlord shall pro-
37 vide the tenant written notice of any increase in the amount of rent charged
38 or of the landlord's intention of nonrenewal of the lease at least thirty

41 (b) Such increase in the amount of rent charged is intended to take ef-
42 fect.
43 SECTION 8. That Section 55-308, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby

2 the demised premises, any time during the continuance of his term, anything
3 affixed thereto for the purposes of trade, manufacture, ornament or domestic
4 use, if the removal can be effected without injury to the premises, unless
5 the thing has, by the manner in which it is affixed, become an integral part
6 of the premises.
7 SECTION 9. That Section 55-309, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
8 amended to read as follows:
9 55-309 55-308. OWNERSHIP OF STREET BY ABUTTER. An owner of land

13 amended to read as follows:
14 55-310 55-309. RIGHT TO LATERAL AND SUBJACENT SUPPORT. Each cotermi-
15 nous owner is entitled to the lateral and subjacent support which his land
16 receives from the adjacent land, subject to the right of the owner of the ad-
17 joining land to make proper and usual excavations on the same for purposes of

30 bound equally to maintain:
31 1. The boundaries and monuments between them.
32 2. The fences between them, unless one of them chooses to let his land
33 lie without fencing, in which case, if he afterward incloses it, he must re-
34 fund to the other the just proportion of the value, at that time, of any divi-
35 sion fence made by the latter.
36 SECTION 13. That Section 55-313, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby

40 hereafter be, constructed across private lands, the person or persons owning
41 or controlling the private lands shall have the right at their own expense
5

2 must be made in such a manner as not to obstruct motor vehicle travel, or to
3 otherwise injure any person or persons using or interested in such access.
4 SECTION 14. That Section 55-314, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby

38 (2) of section 55-307 section 55-306, Idaho Code, which provides that a lo-
39 cal governmental unit shall not enact, maintain, or enforce an ordinance or
40 resolution that would have the effect of regulating rent charged for leasing

43 include an escalation clause for a pro rata share of any increase or decrease
44 in the community's ad valorem taxes, utility assessments, or other services
45 as included in the monthly rental charge, after the effective date of such a
46 change. Issues of public safety, health or property degradation may also be
6
1 included in this section. The landlord shall give thirty (30) days' written
2 notice to a resident before such an increase or decrease.

25 fied in the notice if the tenant shall continue to hold the premises after the
26 expiration of the month.

6 of the premises.

16 receives from the adjacent land, subject to the right of the owner of the ad-

33 lie without fencing, in which case, if he afterward incloses it, he must re-
34 fund to the other the just proportion of the value, at that time, of any divi-
35 sion fence made by the latter.

41 or controlling the private lands shall have the right at their own expense

5

3 otherwise injure any person or persons using or interested in such access.

38 (2) of section 55-307 section 55-306, Idaho Code, which provides that a lo-
39 cal governmental unit shall not enact, maintain, or enforce an ordinance or
40 resolution that would have the effect of regulating rent charged for leasing

46 change. Issues of public safety, health or property degradation may also be

6
