18 state the name of the district but shall not require any signatures of the
19 qualified electors resident within the boundaries of the district.
20 (b) Within thirty (30) days after the filing of such petition, the
21 county commissioners shall determine whether or not the same substantially
22 complies with the requirements of this section. If the county commissioners
23 find that there has not been substantial compliance with such requirements,
24 they shall enter an order to that effect specifying the particular deficien-
25 cies and dismissing the petition. If the county commissioners find that
26 there has been substantial compliance with such requirements, the county
27 commissioners shall forthwith timely enter an order to that effect and
28 calling call an election, subject to the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho

33 (d) Immediately after such election, the judges at such election shall
34 forward the ballots and results of such election to the clerk. The county
35 commissioners shall canvass the vote within ten (10) days after such elec-
36 tion. If one-half (1/2) or more of the votes cast at such election are
37 against the dissolution of such district, the county commissioners shall
38 enter an order so finding and declaring that such district shall not be dis-
39 solved. If more than one-half (1/2) of the votes cast at such election are
40 in favor of dissolving such district, the county commissioners shall enter
41 an order so finding and declaring such district duly dissolved. The county
42 commissioners shall cause one (1) certified copy of such order to be filed in

1 the office of the county recorder of such county. Immediately upon the entry
2 of such order, the dissolution of such district shall be complete.
3 (e) Upon such dissolution being complete, title to all property of the
4 dissolved district shall vest in the county where such property is situated.
5 The county commissioners shall then: sell and dispose thereof in the man-
6 ner provided by law for the sale or disposition of county property; apply the
7 proceeds thereof to pay any lawful claims against the dissolved district, if
8 any; and apply the balance remaining, if any, to any public recreation pur-
9 poses within the county.
10 (f) When the boundaries of the district lie in two (2) or more counties,
11 the county commissioners of each county shall act separately in the elec-
12 tion and dissolution of that part of the district contained in their county
13 but the county commissioners of each such county shall meet together before
14 calling such election and provide for uniform proceedings in each county. If
15 there is any balance remaining after sale and disposition of the property of
16 such dissolved district, it shall be prorated among such counties in propor-
17 tion to each county's share of the total assessed valuation of such dissolved
18 district for the preceding calendar year.
19 (g) After such election, the validity of the proceedings hereunder
20 shall not be affected by any defect in the petition or in the number or
21 qualifications of the signers thereof, and in no event shall any action be
22 commenced or maintained or defense made affecting the validity of the dis-
23 solution of such district after six (6) months has expired from the date of
24 entering the order declaring the dissolution of such district.
25 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
26 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
