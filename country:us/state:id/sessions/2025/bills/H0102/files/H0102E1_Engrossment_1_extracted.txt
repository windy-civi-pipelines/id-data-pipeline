12 poses within the county.

19 such dissolved district, it shall be prorated among such counties in propor-
20 tion to each county's share of the total assessed valuation of such dissolved
21 district for the preceding calendar year.
22 (g) After such election, the validity of the proceedings hereunder
23 shall not be affected by any defect in the petition or in the number or
24 qualifications of the signers thereof, and in no event shall any action be
