5 ber of qualified candidates who have been nominated is equal to the number
6 of supervisors to be elected, it shall not be necessary for the candidates to

8 elected as supervisors, and the soil and water conservation district shall

5 ber of qualified candidates who have been nominated is equal to the number
6 of supervisors to be elected, it shall not be necessary for the candidates to
7 stand for election. The board of supervisors shall declare such candidates
8 elected as supervisors, and the soil and water conservation district shall
