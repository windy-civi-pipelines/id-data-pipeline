4 section (b) of this section; and
5 (3) Communication to the shareholders entitled to vote on the transac-

8 holders' action at a meeting, the shareholders entitled to vote shall be
9 determined as of the record date for notice of the meeting.
10 (b) A director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transac-
11 tion shall, before the shareholders' vote, inform the secretary, or other
12 officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes, in writ-
13 ing, of the number of shares that the director knows are not qualified shares
14 under subsection (c) of this section, and the identity of the holders of
15 those shares.

18 shareholder, a beneficial shareholder, and an unrestricted voting
19 trust beneficial owner; and
20 (2) "Qualified shares" means all shares entitled to be voted with re-

16
1 33-1004E. DISTRICT'S SALARY-BASED APPORTIONMENT. Each district shall
2 be entitled to a salary-based apportionment calculated as provided in this
3 section.
4 (1) To determine the apportionment for instructional staff, take
5 the amounts indicated on the career ladder table plus the amounts associ-
6 ated with the additional education allocation amounts pursuant to section
7 33-1004B, Idaho Code, and calculate the weighted average. The amount so
8 determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for instruc-
9 tional staff determined as provided in section 33-1004(2), Idaho Code.
10 Full-time instructional staff salaries shall be determined from a salary
11 schedule developed by each district and submitted to the state department of
12 education. No full-time instructional staff member or pupil service staff
13 member on the residency compensation rung shall be paid less than the minimum
14 dollar amount on the career ladder residency compensation rung pursuant to
15 section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, for the applicable fiscal year.
16 (2) Effective July 1, 2022, no full-time instructional staff member
17 or pupil service staff member on the professional or advanced professional
18 compensation rung shall be paid less than the minimum dollar amount on the
19 career ladder professional compensation rung pursuant to section 33-1004B,
20 Idaho Code, for the applicable fiscal year.
21 (3) Effective July 1, 2025, no full-time instructional staff member or
22 pupil service staff member on the advanced professional compensation rung
23 shall be paid less than the minimum dollar amount on the advanced profes-
24 sional compensation rung pursuant to section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, for the
25 applicable fiscal year.
26 (4) If an instructional staff member has been certified by the national
27 board for professional teaching standards, the staff member shall receive
28 two thousand dollars ($2,000) per year for five (5) years from the year in
29 which national board certification was earned. The district staff allot-
30 ment shall be increased by two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each national
31 board-certified instructional staff member who earned national board cer-
32 tification; provided however, that no such awards shall be paid for the pe-
33 riod July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, nor shall any liabilities accrue
34 or payments be made pursuant to this section in the future to any individu-
35 als who would have otherwise qualified for a payment during this stated time
36 period. The resulting amount is the district's salary-based apportionment
37 for instructional staff. For purposes of this section, teachers qualifying
38 for the salary increase shall be those who have been recognized as national
39 board-certified teachers as of July 1 of each year.
40 (5) To determine the apportionment for pupil service staff, take
41 the amounts indicated on the career ladder table plus the amounts associ-
42 ated with the additional education allocation amounts pursuant to section
43 33-1004B, Idaho Code, and calculate the weighted average. If the district
44 does not employ any pupil service staff, the district's pupil service staff
45 average salary shall equal the district's instructional staff average
46 salary for purposes of calculating pupil service salary-based apportion-
47 ment. The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff al-
48 lowance for pupil service staff determined pursuant to section 33-1004(3),
49 Idaho Code. Full-time pupil service staff salaries shall be determined from
50 a salary schedule developed by each district and submitted to the state de-

17
1 partment of education. The resulting amount is the district's salary-based
2 apportionment for pupil service staff. No full-time pupil service staff
3 member shall be paid less than the minimum dollar amount on the career ladder
4 residency compensation rung pursuant to section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, for
5 the applicable fiscal year.
6 (6) To determine the apportionment for district administrative staff,
7 first determine the district average experience and education index by plac-
8 ing all eligible certificated administrative employees on the statewide
9 index provided in section 33-1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting average is the
10 district index. If the district does not employ any administrative staff,
11 the district administrative index shall equal the statewide average index
12 for purposes of calculating administrative salary-based apportionment. On
13 and after July 1, 2024, the district administrative staff index shall be
14 multiplied by the base salary of forty-four thousand four hundred forty-six
15 dollars ($44,446). The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the
16 district staff allowance for administrative staff determined as provided
17 in section 33-1004(4), Idaho Code. The resulting amount is the district's
18 salary-based apportionment for administrative staff. forty-three thousand
19 five hundred eighty-three dollars ($43,583)
20 (7) On and after July 1, 2024, to determine the apportionment for clas-
21 sified staff, multiply thirty-nine thousand nine hundred sixty-six dollars
22 ($39,966) by the district classified staff allowance determined as pro-
23 vided in section 33-1004(5), Idaho Code. The amount so determined is the
24 district's apportionment for classified staff. thirty-nine thousand one
25 hundred ninety dollars ($39,190)
26 (8) The district's salary-based apportionment shall be the sum of the
27 apportionments calculated in subsections (1), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of this
28 section, plus the benefit apportionment as provided in section 33-1004F,
29 Idaho Code.

25 SUPPLY. (1) The area having a common ground water supply for the eastern
26 Snake plain aquifer, as that term is used in the administration of water
27 rights pursuant to the rules for the conjunctive management of surface and
28 ground water resources, is the aquifer underlying the eastern Snake river
29 plain as described in model calibration report, eastern Snake plain aquifer
30 model version 2.2. of May 2021.
31 (2) The director of the department of water resources may expand the
32 area having a common ground water supply for the eastern Snake plain aquifer
33 to include tributary basins that affect the eastern Snake river plain
34 aquifer. The director shall not expand the area having a common ground water
35 supply for the eastern Snake plain aquifer to include areas that have been
36 designated as a critical ground water area or a ground water management area
37 and that have approved ground water management plans unless the director
38 determines that the existing ground water management plan for such tributary
39 basin is insufficient to manage the effects of ground water withdrawals on
40 the aquifer from which withdrawals are made and on any other hydraulically
41 connected sources of water, including the eastern Snake plain aquifer.
42 (3) Before entering an order expanding the eastern Snake plain aquifer
43 area of common ground water supply pursuant to subsection (2) of this sec-
44 tion, the director shall, by regular mail, send notice of the proposed action
45 to the owner of each water right proposed to be administered in the tribu-
46 tary basin. The notice shall describe the proposed action to be taken, the
47 reasons therefore therefor, and the time and place of a hearing to be held
48 concerning the proposed action, and shall provide a time period within which
49 written comment on the action will be accepted. The hearing shall not be

19
1 held sooner than ten (10) days after the mailing of the notice, and the writ-
2 ten comment period shall not close sooner than ten (10) days after the hear-
3 ing. Instead of mailing notice, the director may publish notice describ-
4 ing the proposed action, the time and place for the hearing, and the deadline
5 for receiving written comment. The notice shall be published once a week for
6 two (2) weeks in a newspaper having general circulation within the tributary
7 basin, with the second publication appearing at least ten (10) days before
8 the date set for the hearing. The hearing shall be held within the tributary
9 basin or at some nearby location convenient to the affected water users. The
10 department shall allow for both oral and written comments to be provided.
11 (4) The director may issue an order expanding the eastern Snake plain
12 aquifer area of common ground water supply after the hearing. Any person
13 aggrieved by the action of the director may contest such action pursuant to
14 section 42-1701A(3), Idaho Code.
15 SECTION 19. That Section 49-1613, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
16 amended to read as follows:
17 49-1613. UNLAWFUL ACTS BY LICENSEE. (1) It shall be unlawful for the
18 holder of any license issued under the provisions of this chapter to:
19 (a) Intentionally publish or circulate any advertising that is mis-
20 leading or inaccurate in any material particular or that misrepresents
21 any of the products sold or furnished by a licensed dealer;
22 (b) Violate any of the provisions of this chapter or any of the applica-
23 ble rules;
24 (c) Knowingly purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or dispose of a
25 stolen vehicle;
26 (d) Violate any law respecting commerce in vehicles or any lawful rule
27 respecting commerce in vehicles promulgated by any licensing or regu-
28 lating authority now existing or hereafter created by the laws of the
29 state;
30 (e) Engage in the business for which the dealer is licensed without at
31 all times maintaining a principal place of business;
32 (f) Engage in a type of business respecting the selling or exchanging of
33 vehicles for which he is not licensed;
34 (g) Knowingly purchase a vehicle that has an altered or removed vehicle
35 identification number plate or alter or remove a vehicle identification
36 number plate;
37 (h) Violate any provision of this title or any rules promulgated;
38 (i) Violate any provision of the federal motor vehicle safety stan-
39 dards, federal odometer laws or regulations;
40 (j) Display for sale, exchange, or sell any vehicle for which the vehi-
41 cle dealer does not hold title or consignment agreement or other docu-
42 mentary evidence of his right to the possession of every vehicle in his
43 possession; or
44 (k) Issue more than one (1) temporary permit per vehicle sale pursuant
45 to the provisions set forth in section 49-504(6), Idaho Code.
46 (2) It shall be unlawful for any manufacturer or distributor licensed
47 under this chapter to require, attempt to require, coerce, or attempt to co-
48 erce, any new vehicle dealer in this state to:

20
1 (a) Order or accept delivery of any new vehicle, part or accessory,
2 equipment or any other commodity not required by law that shall not have
3 been voluntarily ordered by the new vehicle dealer. This paragraph is
4 not intended to modify or supersede any terms or provisions of a fran-
5 chise requiring dealers to market a representative line of vehicles
6 that the manufacturer or distributor is publicly advertising.
7 (b) Order or accept delivery of any new vehicle with special features,
8 accessories or equipment not included in the list price of such vehicles
9 as publicly advertised by the manufacturer or distributor.
10 (c) Participate monetarily in an advertising campaign or contest, or
11 to purchase any promotional materials, training materials, showroom or
12 other display decorations or materials at the expense of the dealer.
13 (d) Enter into any agreement with the manufacturer or distributor or to
14 do any other act prejudicial to the dealer by threatening to terminate
15 or cancel a franchise or any contractual agreement existing between
16 the dealer and the manufacturer or distributor. This paragraph is not
17 intended to preclude the manufacturer or distributor from insisting
18 on compliance with reasonable terms or provisions of the franchise or
19 other contractual agreement, and notice in good faith to any dealer of
20 the dealer's violation of those terms or provisions shall not consti-
21 tute a violation of the provisions of this chapter.
22 (e) Change the capital structure of the dealer or the means by or
23 through which the dealer finances the operation of the dealership,
24 provided that the dealer at all times meets any reasonable capital stan-
25 dards determined by the manufacturer or distributor in accordance with
26 uniformly applied criteria. No change in the capital structure shall
27 cause a change in the principal management or have the effect of a sale
28 of the franchise without the consent of the manufacturer or distribu-
29 tor. Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
30 (f) Refrain from participation in the management of, investment in, or
31 the acquisition of any other line of new vehicle or related products.
32 This paragraph does not apply unless the dealer maintains a reasonable
33 line of credit for each make or line of new vehicle, and the dealer re-
34 mains in compliance with any reasonable facilities requirements of the
35 manufacturer or distributor, and no change is made in the principal man-
36 agement of the dealership.
37 (g) Prospectively assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver or
38 estoppel that would relieve any person from liability to be imposed by
39 this chapter or to require any controversy between a dealer and a man-
40 ufacturer, distributor, or representatives, to be referred to any per-
41 son other than the duly constituted courts of the state or the United
42 States, or to the director, if that referral would be binding upon the
43 dealer.
44 (h) Either establish or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or
45 display space.
46 (i) Expand facilities without a written guarantee of a sufficient sup-
47 ply of new vehicles so as to justify an expansion, in light of the market
48 and economic conditions.
49 (j) Make significant modifications to an existing dealership or to
50 construct a new vehicle dealership facility without providing a writ-

21
1 ten guarantee of a sufficient supply of new vehicles so as to justify
2 modification or construction, in light of the market and economic con-
3 ditions.
4 (3) It shall be unlawful for any manufacturer or distributor licensed
5 under this chapter to:
6 (a) Delay, refuse, or fail to deliver new vehicles or new vehicle parts
7 or accessories in a reasonable time, and in reasonable quantity, rela-
8 tive to the dealer's facilities and sales potential in the dealer's rel-
9 evant market area, after acceptance of an order from a dealer having a
10 franchise for the retail sale of any new vehicle sold or distributed by
11 the manufacturer or distributor, any new vehicle, parts or accessories
12 to new vehicles as are covered by the franchise, if the vehicle, parts,
13 or accessories are publicly advertised as being available for delivery
14 or actually being delivered. These provisions are not violated, how-
15 ever, if failure is caused by acts or causes beyond the control of the
16 manufacturer or distributor.
17 (b) Refuse to disclose to any dealer handling the same line, the manner
18 and mode of distribution of that line within this state.
19 (c) Obtain money, goods, service, or any other benefit from any other
20 person with whom the dealer does business, on account of, or in relation
21 to, the transaction between the dealer and other person, other than for
22 compensation for services rendered, unless the benefit is promptly ac-
23 counted for and transmitted to the dealer.
24 (d) Increase prices of new vehicles that the dealer had ordered for
25 consumers prior to the dealer's receipt of the written official price
26 increase notification. A sales contract signed by a consumer shall
27 constitute evidence of each such order, provided that the vehicle is in
28 fact delivered to that customer. In the event of manufacturer or dis-
29 tributor price reductions or cash rebates paid to the dealer, the amount
30 of any reduction or rebate received by a dealer shall be passed on to the
31 private retail consumer by the dealer. Price reductions shall apply to
32 all vehicles in the dealer's inventory that were subject to the price
33 reduction. Price differences applicable to new model or series shall
34 not be considered a price increase or price decrease. Price changes
35 caused by the addition to a vehicle of required or optional equipment,
36 or revaluation of the United States dollar, in the case of foreign-make
37 vehicles or components, or an increase in transportation charges due to
38 increased rates imposed by a carrier, shall not be subject to the provi-
39 sions of this subsection.
40 (e) Release to any outside party, except under subpoena or as other-
41 wise required by law or in an administrative, judicial or arbitration
42 proceeding involving the manufacturer or distributor or dealer, any
43 business, financial, or personal information which may be provided from
44 time to time by the dealer to the manufacturer or distributor without
45 the express written consent of the dealer.
46 (f) Deny any dealer the right of free association with any other dealer
47 for any lawful purpose.
48 (g) Compete with their franchised dealers in this state in the sale,
49 lease, or warranty service of new motor vehicles to retail consumers.
50 However, nothing in this section shall limit or apply to a manufac-

22
1 turer's or a distributor's fleet sales or leases with a fleet customer
2 that has a designation as such by the manufacturer or distributor as
3 long as such sales or leases are conducted with the involvement of a
4 dealer of the same line make. Nothing in this section shall limit or
5 prohibit a manufacturer or distributor from authorizing or assisting
6 a fleet customer that has a designation as such by the manufacturer or
7 distributor to perform warranty service on vehicles owned or operated
8 by such fleet customer. It is not a violation of this paragraph for a
9 manufacturer or distributor, or an affiliate of a manufacturer or dis-
10 tributor, to directly provide an update to or repair of motor vehicle
11 software if such update or repair is provided over-the-air at no cost or
12 when creating a new line of motor vehicles and using franchised deal-
13 ers to sell and service those vehicles. A manufacturer or distributor
14 may operate a dealership for a reasonable period not to exceed one (1)
15 year without violating this paragraph if such dealership is for sale to
16 any qualified independent person at a fair and reasonable price, or in
17 a relationship in which an independent person has made a significant
18 investment subject to loss in the dealership and can reasonably expect
19 to acquire full ownership of that dealership on reasonable terms and
20 conditions. Upon a showing of good cause by the manufacturer or dis-
21 tributor to the department, the period of temporary ownership may be
22 extended up to one (1) additional year, resulting in a maximum temporary
23 ownership period of two (2) years.
24 (h) Unfairly discriminate among its dealers with respect to warranty
25 reimbursement.
26 (i) Unreasonably withhold consent to the sale, transfer, or exchange of
27 the franchise to a qualified buyer capable of being licensed as a dealer
28 in this state or to condition the sale, transfer, or exchange of a fran-
29 chise agreement upon site control or an agreement to renovate or make
30 improvements to a facility, unless required by the technology of a motor
31 vehicle being sold at the facility. Provided however, that a voluntary
32 acceptance of such conditions by the dealer in writing including but not
33 limited to a written agreement for which the dealer has accepted sepa-
34 rate and valuable consideration, shall not constitute a violation.
35 (j) Fail to respond in writing to a request for consent as specified in
36 paragraph (i) of this subsection within sixty (60) days of receipt of a
37 written request on the forms, if any, generally utilized by the manufac-
38 turer or distributor for those purposes and containing the required in-
39 formation. Failure to respond shall be deemed to be consent to the re-
40 quest.
41 (k) Prevent or attempt to prevent, by contract or otherwise, any dealer
42 from changing the executive management control of the dealership unless
43 the manufacturer or distributor, having the burden of proof, can show
44 that the change of executive management will result in executive man-
45 agement or control by a person or persons who are not of good moral char-
46 acter or who do not meet reasonable, preexisting and, with considera-
47 tion given to the volume of sales and service of the dealership, uni-
48 formly applied minimum business experience standards. Where the manu-
49 facturer or distributor rejects a proposed change in executive manage-
50 ment control, the manufacturer or distributor shall give written notice

23
1 of his reasons to the dealer within sixty (60) days of notice to the man-
2 ufacturer or distributor by the dealer of the proposed change; other-
3 wise, the change in the executive management of the dealership shall be
4 presumptively considered approved.
5 (l) Terminate, cancel or fail to renew any franchise solely because of
6 the death or incapacity of an owner who is not listed in the franchise
7 as one on whose expertise and abilities the manufacturer or distributor
8 relied in the granting of the franchise.
9 (m) Prevent or attempt to prevent the dealer, by written instrument
10 or otherwise, from either receiving the fair market value of the deal-
11 ership in a sale transaction or from transferring the dealership to a
12 spouse or legal heir, as specified in this chapter.
13 (n) Engage in any predatory practice or discrimination against any
14 dealer.
15 (o) Resort to or to use any false or misleading advertisement in the
16 conducting of his business as a manufacturer or distributor in this
17 state.
18 (p) Make any false or misleading statement, either directly or through
19 any agent or employee, in order to induce any dealer to enter into any
20 agreement or franchise or to take any action that is prejudicial to that
21 dealer or his business.
22 (q) Require or coerce dealers to participate in local or national ad-
23 vertising campaigns or contests or to require or coerce dealers to pur-
24 chase promotional or display materials.
25 (r) Charge back, deny motor vehicle allocation, withhold payments, or
26 take other actions against a dealer, or to condition a franchise agree-
27 ment, or renewal of a franchise agreement, or to condition sales, ser-
28 vice, parts, or finance incentives upon site control or an agreement to
29 renovate or make improvements to a facility unless required by the tech-
30 nology of a motor vehicle being sold at the facility. Provided however,
31 that a voluntary acceptance of such conditions by the dealer in writing
32 including but not limited to a written agreement for which the dealer
33 has accepted separate and valuable consideration, shall not constitute
34 a violation.
35 (s) Charge back, deny motor vehicle allocation, withhold payments, or
36 take other actions against a motor vehicle dealer if a motor vehicle
37 sold by the motor vehicle dealer is exported from Idaho or the dealer's
38 assigned area of responsibility unless the manufacturer, distributor,
39 or manufacturer representative proves that the motor vehicle dealer
40 knew or reasonably should have known a motor vehicle was intended to
41 be exported, which shall operate as a rebuttable presumption that the
42 motor vehicle dealer did not have such knowledge. This paragraph does
43 not apply if exporting of motor vehicles outside of the state of Idaho is
44 provided for by the manufacturer or distributor.
45 (t) Withhold or threaten to withhold consent or approval of the sale,
46 transfer, exchange, or issuance of a dealer sales and service agreement
47 to an otherwise qualified buyer capable of being licensed as a dealer
48 in this state or to condition approval of such buyer upon the selling
49 dealer executing a release of all claims or similar instrument releas-
50 ing or waiving any and all claims the selling dealer has or may have

24
1 arising from the franchise relationship with the manufacturer unless
2 separate material consideration is paid contemporaneously by the manu-
3 facturer to the dealer for such release. Nothing in this section shall
4 preclude the application of a manufacturer's reasonable and uniform
5 standards and policies.
6 (4) It is unlawful for any manufacturer or distributor or any offi-
7 cer, agent or representative to coerce, or attempt to coerce, any dealer
8 in this state to offer to sell or sell any extended service contract or ex-
9 tended maintenance plan that is offered, sold, backed by or sponsored by
10 the manufacturer or distributor or to sell, assign or transfer any retail
11 installment sales contract, obtained by the dealer in connection with the
12 sale by him in this state of new vehicles, manufactured or sold by the man-
13 ufacturer or distributor, to a specified finance company or class of such
14 companies, or to any other specified person, by any of the acts or means set
15 forth, namely by:
16 (a) Any statement, suggestion, promise or threat that the manufac-
17 turer or distributor will, in any manner, benefit or injure the dealer,
18 whether the statement, suggestion, threat or promise is express or im-
19 plied or made directly or indirectly;
20 (b) Any act that will benefit or injure the dealer;
21 (c) Any contract, or any express or implied offer of contract, made
22 directly or indirectly to a dealer for handling new vehicles, on the
23 condition that the dealer shall offer to sell or sell any extended
24 service contract or extended maintenance plan that is offered, sold,
25 backed by, or sponsored by the manufacturer or distributor or sell, as-
26 sign or transfer his retail installment sales contract in this state to
27 a specified finance company or class of such companies, or to any other
28 specified person; or
29 (d) Any express or implied statement or representation made directly or
30 indirectly that the dealer is under any obligation whatsoever to offer
31 to sell or sell any extended service contract or extended maintenance
32 plan that is offered, sold, backed by, or sponsored by the manufacturer
33 or distributor or to sell, assign or transfer any of his retail sales
34 contracts, in this state, on new vehicles manufactured or sold by that
35 manufacturer or distributor to a finance company or class of companies,
36 or other specified person, because of any relationship or affiliation
37 between the manufacturer or distributor and a finance company or compa-
38 nies, or a specified person or persons.
39 (e) Nothing contained in this subsection shall prohibit a manufacturer
40 or distributor from offering or providing incentive benefits or bonus
41 programs to a retail motor vehicle dealer or prospective retail motor
42 vehicle dealer in this state who makes the voluntary decision to offer
43 to sell or sell any extended service contract or extended maintenance
44 plan offered, sold, backed by or sponsored by the manufacturer or dis-
45 tributor to sell, assign or transfer any retail installment sale or
46 lease by him in this state of motor vehicles manufactured or sold by the
47 manufacturer or distributor to a specified finance company or leasing
48 company controlled by or affiliated with the manufacturer or distribu-
49 tor.

25
1 Any statement, threats, promises, acts, contracts or offers of con-
2 tracts, when the effect may be to lessen or eliminate competition or tend to
3 create a monopoly, are declared unfair trade practices and unfair methods of
4 competition, against the policy of this state, and are unlawful.
5 (5) It is unlawful for any manufacturer or distributor or agent or em-
6 ployee of a manufacturer or distributor to use a written instrument, agree-
7 ment, or waiver to attempt to nullify any of the provisions of this section,
8 and such agreement, written instrument or waiver shall be null and void.
9 (6) It shall be unlawful, directly or indirectly, to impose unrea-
10 sonable restrictions on the dealer relative to the sale, transfer, right
11 to renew, termination discipline, noncompetition covenants, site control
12 (whether by sublease, collateral pledge of lease, or otherwise), right of
13 first refusal to purchase, option to purchase, compliance with subjective
14 standards and assertion of legal or equitable rights.
15 (7) The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all written franchise
16 agreements between a manufacturer or distributor and a dealer, including
17 the franchise offering, the franchise agreement, sales of goods, services
18 or advertising, leases or mortgages of real or personal property, promises
19 to pay, security interests, pledges, insurance contract, advertising con-
20 tract, construction or installation contract, servicing contracts and all
21 other agreements where the manufacturer or distributor has any direct or
22 indirect interest.
23 (8)(a) It shall be unlawful for any manufacturer or distributor,
24 whether by agreement, program, incentive provision, or provision for
25 loss of incentive payments or other benefits, to establish or implement
26 a franchise agreement for the sales and leasing of new motor vehicles
27 under which the manufacturer or distributor reserves the right to:
28 (i) Maintain a website or other electronic or digital means of
29 communication for the manufacturer or distributor to negotiate
30 binding terms of sale or leasing of new motor vehicles directly
31 with the retail buyer or lessee without the involvement of a dealer
32 on prices or other substantive terms of sale or leasing of new ve-
33 hicles;
34 (ii) Retain ownership of new motor vehicles until they are sold or
35 leased to the retail buyer or lessee;
36 (iii) Except for the sale or lease of a vehicle to a bona fide em-
37 ployee or relative of such manufacturer or distributor or in con-
38 nection with a replacement or buyback, or to a bona fide employee
39 or relative of a dealer under an employee pricing or similar pro-
40 gram, consign new motor vehicles to dealers for dealer inventory
41 or for sale or lease to a retail buyer or lessee;
42 (iv) Negotiate binding terms of sale directly with retail buy-
43 ers or lessees of new motor vehicles without the involvement of a
44 dealer, provided that displaying on a website or other electronic
45 or digital means of communication conditional prices, available
46 financing sources, or conditional trade-in values that are not
47 binding on a dealer shall not be considered negotiating;
48 (v) Enforce or seek to enforce a right in any franchise agreement
49 for the manufacturer or distributor to unilaterally amend or mod-
50 ify the franchise agreement; or

26
1 (vi) Amend or modify or attempt to amend or modify any dealer sales
2 and service agreement, including but not limited to the dealer's
3 relevant market area if the amendment or modification substan-
4 tially and adversely affects the dealer's rights, obligations,
5 investment or return on investment, without giving sixty (60) days
6 advance written notice of the proposed amendment or modification
7 to the dealer.
8 (b) Nothing in this subsection shall prevent a manufacturer or distrib-
9 utor from:
10 (i) Participating in fleet sales or leasing with a fleet customer
11 that has a designation as such by the manufacturer or distributor
12 as long as such sales or leases are conducted with the involvement
13 of a dealer of the same line make;
14 (ii) Authorizing or assisting a fleet customer that has a des-
15 ignation as such by the manufacturer or distributor to perform
16 warranty service on vehicles owned or operated by such fleet cus-
17 tomers;
18 (iii) Offering, providing, and applying the terms of an employee
19 pricing or similar program with participating dealers;
20 (iv) Negotiating binding terms of sale relating to the sale or
21 lease of a vehicle to a bona fide employee or relative of such manu-
22 facturer or distributor;
23 (v) Negotiating binding terms of sale relating to the sale or
24 lease of a vehicle to a bona fide employee or relative of a fran-
25 chised dealer under an employee pricing program or similar pro-
26 gram;
27 (vi) Negotiating binding terms of sale relating to the sale or
28 lease of a vehicle in connection with a vehicle replacement or buy-

30 (vii) Purchasing from a consumer a vehicle in connection with a ve-
31 hicle replacement or buyback;
32 (viii) Maintaining a website or other electronic or digital means
33 of communication if the final selling or leasing price of the new
34 vehicle is determined by eligible dealers; or
35 (ix) Setting or advertising a manufacturer's suggested retail
36 price or lease example pricing based on a manufacturer's suggested
37 retail price, special financing, or lease offers.
38 (9)(a) Within the sixty (60) day notice period provided for in sub-
39 section (8)(a)(vii) (8)(a)(vi) of this section, the dealer may pursue
40 remedies under section 49-1617, Idaho Code, and file with the depart-
41 ment and serve upon the respondent a petition to determine whether
42 good cause exists for permitting the proposed modification. Multiple
43 complaints pertaining to the same proposed modification may be con-
44 solidated for hearing. The proposed modification may not take effect
45 pending the determination of any protest filed by a dealer. In making a
46 determination of whether there is good cause for permitting a proposed
47 modification of a dealer sales and service agreement, including but not
48 limited to a dealer's relevant market area, the burden of proof shall be
49 on the manufacturer or distributor, except that the burden of proof with
50 regard to the factor set forth in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph

27
1 shall be on the dealer. The department shall consider any relevant fac-
2 tor, including:
3 (i) The reasons for the proposed modification;
4 (ii) Whether the proposed modification is applied to or affects
5 all motor vehicle dealers in a nondiscriminatory manner;
6 (iii) The degree to which the proposed modification will have
7 a substantial and adverse effect on the motor vehicle dealer's
8 rights, investment, or return on investment; and
9 (iv) Whether the proposed modification is in the public interest.
10 (b) With respect to a proposed modification of a dealer's relevant mar-
11 ket area the department shall also consider:
12 (i) The traffic patterns between consumers and the same line-
13 make franchised dealers of the affected manufacturer or distrib-
14 utor who are located within the market;
15 (ii) The pattern of new vehicle sales and registrations of the af-
16 fected manufacturer or distributor within various portions of the
17 relevant market area and within the market as a whole;
18 (iii) The growth or decline in population, density of population,
19 and new car registrations in the market;
20 (iv) The presence or absence of natural geographical obstacles or
21 boundaries;
22 (v) The proximity of census tracts or other geographic units used
23 by the affected manufacturer or distributor in determining the
24 same line-make dealers' respective relevant market area; and
25 (vi) The reasonableness of the change or proposed change to the
26 dealer's relevant market area, considering the benefits and harm
27 to the petitioning dealer, other same line-make dealers, and the
28 manufacturer or distributor.
29 (10) It shall be unlawful for any manufacturer or distributor to imple-
30 ment a program or policy that coerces or requires the franchisee to install
31 direct current fast charging stations for public access or use or any simi-
32 lar public-facing infrastructure relating to charging, fueling, or powering
33 a vehicle. For purposes of this section, the term "coerce" means the use of
34 force or threats to compel a dealer to take a specific action. "Coerce" in-
35 cludes threatening to withhold vehicles or parts from a franchisee or charg-
36 ing a franchisee a higher price for vehicles or parts on the basis of the
37 franchisee refusing, declining, or failing to perform a specific behavior.
38 Provided, however, that nothing contained in this subsection shall be deemed
39 to prohibit or prevent a manufacturer or distributor from requiring a fran-
40 chisee to purchase special tools or equipment, install reasonable charging
41 infrastructure, stock reasonable quantities of certain parts, or partici-
42 pate in training, reasonable sales and service programs, or policies that
43 are reasonably necessary for such franchisee to sell or service any model or
44 series of vehicles.
45 SECTION 20. That Section 54-1810, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby

24 CHAPTER 19 21
25 CRISIS RESPONSE FOR PERSONS WITH A NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDER
26 56-1901 56-2101. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the legis-
27 lature that persons with a neurocognitive disorder who are in acute crisis
28 due to an unidentified underlying medical condition can get the care they
29 need and return home once the underlying medical condition is resolved. The
30 legislature further intends that state agencies and community partners will
31 collaborate to provide the most dignified care for persons with a neurocog-
32 nitive disorder.
33 56-1902 56-2102. GOVERNMENTAL LIABILITY. All provisions of chapter 9,
34 title 6, Idaho Code, shall apply to any claim of tortious conduct on the part
35 of a person action acting or refusing to act in conformance with this chap-
36 ter.
37 56-1903 56-2103. DEFINITIONS. As used in this chapter:
38 (1) "Department" means the state department of health and welfare.
39 (2) "Health care provider" means a person licensed, certified, or
40 otherwise authorized by law to administer health care services in the ordi-
41 nary course of business or practice of a profession, including a physician,
42 physician assistant, and advanced practice registered nurse.

38
1 (3) "Health care services" means services for the diagnosis, preven-
2 tion, treatment, cure, or relief of a health condition, illness, injury, or
3 disease.
4 (4) "Hospital" means a medical hospital as defined in section 39-1301,
5 Idaho Code, including freestanding emergency departments.
6 (5) "Likely to injure themselves or others" means:
7 (a) A substantial risk that serious physical harm will be inflicted by
8 the person upon their own person, as evidenced by threats of suicide or
9 threats to inflict serious physical harm on themselves;
10 (b) A substantial risk that serious physical harm will be inflicted by
11 the person upon another as evidenced by behavior that has caused such
12 harm or that places another person or persons in reasonable fear of sus-
13 taining such harm; or
14 (c) The person lacks insight into the need for treatment and is unable
15 or unwilling to comply with treatment based on the person's medical
16 history, clinical observation, or other clinical evidence, and if the
17 person does not receive and comply with treatment, there is a substan-
18 tial risk that the person will continue to physically, emotionally,
19 or cognitively deteriorate to the point that the person will, in the
20 reasonably near future, inflict serious physical harm on themselves or
21 another person.
22 (6) "Neurocognitive disorder" has the same meaning as provided in sec-
23 tion 66-317(13), Idaho Code, except that for purposes of this chapter neu-
24 rocognitive disorder does not include decreased mental function due to inap-
25 propriate use or abuse of substances or medications.
26 (7) "Peace officer" means an employee of a law enforcement agency that
27 is a part of or administered by the state or any political subdivision of the

29 detection of crime and the enforcement of penal, traffic, or highway laws
30 of the state or any political subdivision of the state. Peace officer also
31 means an employee of a police or law enforcement agency of a federally recog-
32 nized Indian tribe who has satisfactorily completed the peace officer stan-
33 dards and training academy and has been deputized by a sheriff of a county or
34 a chief of police of a city of the state of Idaho.
35 (8) "Protective custody" means when a peace officer detains a person
36 and takes such person to a hospital. The peace officer shall make every rea-
37 sonable effort to protect the person's health and safety while the peace of-
38 ficer takes reasonable steps to protect the peace officer's safety. Protec-
39 tive custody under this section is not an arrest.
40 56-1904 56-2104. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY WITHOUT HEARING. (1) No person
41 shall be taken into protective custody or detained as an alleged emergency
42 patient for observation, diagnosis, evaluation, care or treatment of a
43 neurocognitive disorder unless and until the court has ordered such ap-
44 prehension and custody pursuant to section 56-1905 56-2105, Idaho Code;
45 provided, however, that a person may be taken into custody by a peace officer
46 and placed in a hospital, or the person may be detained at a hospital at which
47 the person presented or was brought to receive medical care, if the peace
48 officer or a health care provider in such hospital has reason to believe
49 that person has a neurocognitive disorder and the person is likely to injure

39
1 themselves or others; provided, under no circumstances shall the person be
2 detained in a nonmedical unit used for the detention of persons charged with
3 or convicted of penal offenses. Whenever a person is taken into custody or
4 detained pursuant to this section without a court order, the evidence sup-
5 porting the claim that the person with the neurocognitive disorder is likely
6 to injure themselves or others must be presented to a duly authorized court
7 within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the person was placed in custody
8 or detained.
9 (2) If the court finds there is reason to believe the person is likely
10 to have a neurocognitive disorder and likely to injure themselves or others
11 pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the court shall issue a temporary
12 protective placement custody order requiring the person to be held in a hos-
13 pital and requiring an examination of the person by a health care provider in
14 such hospital within twenty-four (24) hours of the entry of the order of the
15 court. Under no circumstances shall the person be detained in a nonmedical
16 unit used for the detention of persons charged with or convicted of penal of-
17 fenses.
18 (3) Where an examination is required pursuant to subsection (2) of this
19 section, the health care provider in such hospital shall make findings and
20 report to the court within twenty-four (24) hours of the examination.
21 (4) If at any time after the person is placed in protective custody the
22 health care provider in such hospital conducting the examination determines
23 the person no longer meets criteria for protective custody, the person shall
24 be deemed to be a voluntary patient and subject to release.
25 (5) If the health care provider in such hospital finds, in an examina-
26 tion pursuant to this section, that the person is likely to have a neurocog-
27 nitive disorder and is likely to injure themselves or others, the prosecut-
28 ing attorney shall file, within twenty-four (24) hours of the examination
29 of the person, a petition with the court requesting the person's continued
30 protective placement pending review proceedings pursuant to section 56-1905
31 56-2105, Idaho Code.
32 (6) Upon the receipt of such a petition, the court shall order the per-
33 son's detention to await hearing, which shall be within five (5) days, in-
34 cluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, of the protective placement
35 order. If no petition is filed within twenty-four (24) hours of the exami-
36 nation described in subsection (5) of this section, the person shall be re-
37 leased from the protective placement.
38 (7) Upon taking a person into custody, a good faith effort shall be made
39 to provide notice to the person's legal guardian, parent, spouse, or adult
40 next of kin of the person's physical whereabouts and the reasons for taking
41 the person into custody.
42 (8) Nothing in this section shall preclude a hospital from transferring
43 a person who has been detained pursuant to this section to another hospital
44 that is willing to accept the transferred person for purposes of observa-
45 tion, diagnosis, evaluation, care, or treatment.
46 56-1905 56-2105. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY UPON COURT ORDER -- JUDICIAL PRO-
47 CEDURE. (1) Proceedings by a hospital for the involuntary care and treatment
48 of persons likely to have a neurocognitive disorder who are in acute crisis
49 due to an underlying medical condition may be commenced by the filing of a

40
1 written application for emergency protective placement with a court of com-
2 petent jurisdiction by a friend, relative, spouse, or guardian of the per-
3 son, by a health care provider practicing in a hospital, by a prosecuting at-
4 torney or other public official of a municipality, county, or the state of
5 Idaho, or by the director of any facility in which such person may be located.
6 (2) The application for emergency protective placement shall state the
7 name and last known address of the person; the name and address of the spouse,
8 guardian, next of kin, or friend of the person; whether the person can be
9 cared for privately in the event a hold is not ordered; whether the person is,
10 at the time of the application, a voluntary patient; whether the person has
11 applied for release; and a simple and precise statement of the facts show-
12 ing that the person is likely to have a neurocognitive disorder and is either
13 likely to injure themselves or others.
14 (3) Any such application for emergency protective placement shall be
15 accompanied by a certificate of a health care provider practicing in such
16 hospital stating that a health care provider practicing in such hospital has
17 personally examined the person within the last fourteen (14) days and is of
18 the opinion that the person has a neurocognitive disorder and is likely to
19 injure themselves or others and lacks capacity to make informed decisions
20 about treatment or by a written statement by the applicant that the person
21 has refused to submit to examination by a health care provider practicing in
22 such hospital.
23 (4) Upon receipt of an application for emergency protective placement,
24 the court shall, within forty-eight (48) hours, order another health care
25 provider practicing in such hospital to make a personal examination of the
26 person, or if the person has not been examined, the court shall appoint two
27 (2) health care providers practicing in such hospital to make individual
28 personal examinations of the person and may order the person to submit to an
29 immediate examination. If neither is a physician, the court shall order a
30 physical examination of the person. The health care provider practicing in
31 such hospital shall report to the court findings within the following sev-
32 enty-two (72) hours as to the medical condition of the person and the need
33 for custody, care, or treatment by a hospital. The reports shall be in the
34 form of written certificates that shall be filed with the court. The court
35 may terminate the proceedings and dismiss the application without taking any
36 further action in the event the reports are to the effect that the person is
37 not likely to injure themselves or others due to a neurocognitive disorder.
38 If the proceedings are terminated, the person shall be released immediately.
39 (5) If the health care provider practicing in such hospital certifies a
40 belief that the person is likely to injure themselves or others due to a neu-
41 rocognitive disorder, the judge shall issue an order authorizing any health
42 officer, peace officer, or director of a facility to take the person to a hos-
43 pital in the community in which the person is residing or to the nearest hos-
44 pital to await the hearing, and for good cause, may authorize treatment dur-
45 ing such period. Under no circumstances shall the person be detained in a
46 nonmedical unit used for the detention of individuals charged with or con-
47 victed of penal offenses.
48 (6) Upon receipt of such application for emergency protective place-
49 ment by the health care provider practicing in such hospital, the court
50 shall appoint a time and place for a hearing not more than seven (7) days from

41
1 the receipt of such certificates and thereupon give written notice of such
2 time and place of such hearing, together with a copy of the application, the
3 health care provider's certificates, and notice of the person's right to be
4 represented by an attorney or, if indigent, to be represented by a court-ap-
5 pointed attorney to the applicant, and to the person and the person's spouse,
6 guardian, next of kin, or friend. With the consent of the person and the
7 person's attorney, the hearing may be held immediately. Upon motion of the
8 petitioner, or upon motion of the person and the person's attorney, and for
9 good cause shown, the court may continue the hearing up to an additional
10 seven (7) days during which time, for good cause shown, the court may autho-
11 rize treatment.
12 (7) An opportunity to be represented by counsel shall be afforded to ev-
13 ery person and, if neither the person nor others provide counsel, the court
14 shall appoint counsel in accordance with chapter 8, title 19, Idaho Code, no
15 later than the time the application for emergency protective placement is
16 received by the court.
17 (8) If the protective placement is commenced under this section, the
18 hearing shall be held in a manner and at a suitable place not likely to have
19 a harmful effect on the person's physical or mental health. Venue for the
20 hearing shall be in the county of residence of the person or in the county
21 where the person was found immediately prior to commencement of such pro-
22 ceedings.
23 (9) In all proceedings under this section, any existing provision of
24 the law prohibiting the disclosure of confidential communications between
25 the person and the health care provider practicing in such hospital shall not
26 apply and any health care provider practicing in such hospital who shall have
27 examined the person shall be a competent witness to testify as to the per-
28 son's condition.
29 (10) The person, the applicant, and any other persons to whom notice is
30 required to be given shall be afforded an opportunity to appear at the hear-
31 ing to testify and to present and cross-examine witnesses. The person may,
32 after consulting with the person's attorney, request to waive the person's
33 presence at court. The court may waive the presence of the person if the men-
34 tal or physical state of the person is such that the person's presence at the
35 hearing would be detrimental to the person's health or would unduly disrupt
36 the proceedings. A record of the proceedings shall be made as for other civil
37 hearings. The hearing shall be conducted in as informal a manner as may be
38 consistent with orderly procedure. The court shall receive all relevant and
39 material evidence consistent with the rules of evidence.
40 (11) If, upon completion of the hearing and consideration of the record,
41 and after consideration of reasonable alternatives, the court finds by clear
42 and convincing evidence that the person likely has a neurocognitive disorder
43 and is likely to injure themselves or others, the court shall order the per-
44 son to be placed under protective custody of a suitable medical hospital for
45 observation, care, and treatment for an indeterminate period of time not to
46 exceed seven (7) days.
47 (12) The order of protective placement shall state whether the person
48 lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment and the name and
49 address of the person's attorney, spouse, guardian, adult next of kin, or
50 friend.

42
1 (13) If the person has no spouse or guardian and if the person has prop-
2 erty that may not be cared for by the person while confined at a hospital,
3 the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the purpose of preserving the
4 person's estate, pending further guardianship or conservatorship proceed-
5 ings.

7 person is taken into custody pursuant to sections 56-1904 and 56-1905

9 from protective custody.

12 board, room, and support services.
13 (c) "Third-party applicant" means a person other than a patient who

16 patient's family or household, the patient's authorized representa-
17 tive, or, if the patient is incapacitated, someone, including an agent
18 of a facility, who is acting responsibly for the patient.
19 (2) In instances where the person placed in protective custody is re-
20 leased with no underlying medical conditions in addition to the person's
21 neurocognitive disorder having been identified, costs associated with the
22 protective custody shall be the responsibility of the person placed in
23 protective custody, subject to the department of health and welfare's deter-
24 mination of the person's ability to pay all or any part of such costs. The
25 department shall:
26 (a) Use the state-approved fee determination form and sliding fee
27 schedule described in rules promulgated by the department to determine
28 the person's ability to pay;
29 (b) Inquire to determine if the person has insurance, including medical
30 assistance provided under the state plan for medicaid as authorized by
31 title XIX of the social security act, as amended; and

36 during protective custody shall be assigned to a person's health insurance,

38 authorized by title XIX of the social security act, as amended. If a person
39 may be eligible for medicaid but has not applied, a third-party applicant,
40 including an agent at a hospital where a person is taken into custody or de-
41 tained under this chapter, may submit a medicaid application to the depart-
42 ment of health and welfare. The medical care provided while the person is in
43 protective custody shall be presumed to be medically necessary for purposes
44 of determining reimbursement for that care by third-party payers.
45 (5) Remaining costs for routine medical care shall be apportioned as
46 follows:
47 (a) The department of health and welfare shall pay providers at the rate
48 established by medicaid or its managed care organization. If, based on
49 the department of health and welfare's determination under subsection

2 costs, the person shall reimburse the department consistent with the
3 department's sliding fee schedule; or
4 (b) Costs for routine medical care during the protective placement pe-
5 riod shall be paid by the department of health and welfare, consistent
6 with the process described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.
