28 (i) The boards of county commissioners of the counties in
29 which the release is proposed to take place have been given
30 reasonable notice of the proposed release.
31 (ii) The affected federal and state land grazing permittees
32 and owners or leaseholders of private land in or contiguous

41 posed transplant or transplants are planned for.

49 quest. It is the policy of the state of Idaho that existing sheep
50 or livestock operations in the area of any bighorn sheep trans-
6
1 plant or relocation are recognized and that the potential risk,
2 if any, of disease transmission and loss of bighorn sheep when the
3 same invade domestic livestock or sheep operations is accepted.

5 eas they do not now inhabit or a transplant or relocation for the

11 livestock operations in the area of any such bighorn sheep trans-
12 plant or relocation are recognized and that the potential risk,
13 if any, of disease transmission and loss of bighorn sheep when the
14 same invade domestic livestock or sheep operations is accepted.

19 allotment(s) that currently have any bighorn sheep upon or in
20 proximity to the allotment(s); (2) within ninety (90) days of the
21 effective date of this act will cooperatively develop best manage-
22 ment practices with the permittee(s) on the allotment(s). Upon
23 commencement of the implementation of best management practices,
24 the director shall certify that the risk of disease transmission,
25 if any, between bighorn and domestic sheep is acceptable for the
26 viability of the bighorn sheep. The director's certification
27 shall continue for as long as the best management practices are
28 implemented. The director may also certify that the risk of dis-
29 ease transmission, if any, between bighorn and domestic sheep
30 is acceptable for the viability of the bighorn sheep based upon
31 a finding that other factors exist, including but not limited
32 to previous exposure to pathogens that make separation between

49 signee shall make an order embodying his findings in respect
50 to when, under what circumstances, in which localities, by
7
1 what means, and in what amounts, numbers and sex the wildlife
2 subject to the hunt may be taken. In the event an emergency
3 is declared to exist, such open season shall become effec-
4 tive forthwith upon written order of the director or his
5 designee; in all other cases, upon publication and posting
6 as provided in section 36-105, Idaho Code.

8 or his designee, the individual or landowner with the kill
9 permit, in conjunction with their responsibility for field
10 dressing the animals taken, may keep one (1) animal for their
11 personal use. In the event the director or his designee
12 issues a subsequent kill permit for the same individual or
13 landowner due to continued depredation, the director or his
14 designee may authorize the individual or landowner to keep a
15 second subsequently taken animal for their personal use.
16 (C) Any season closure order issued under authority hereof shall
17 be published in at least one (1) newspaper of general circulation

24 on such wildlife shall be in force and whoever violates any of the
25 provisions shall be subject to the penalties prescribed therefor.
26 (E) Prior to the opening of any special depredation hunt, the di-
27 rector or his designee shall be authorized to provide up to a max-
28 imum of fifty percent (50%) of the available permits for such big
29 game to the landholder(s) of privately owned land within the hunt
30 area or his designees. If the landholder(s) chooses to designate
31 hunters, he must provide a written list of the names of designated
32 individuals to the department. If the landholder(s) fails to des-
33 ignate licensed hunters, then the department will issue the total
34 available permits in the manner set by rule. All hunters must have
35 a current hunting license and shall have equal access to both pub-
36 lic and private lands within the hunt boundaries. It shall be un-

8 department of agriculture.
9 10. In order to monitor and evaluate the disease status of wildlife and
10 to protect Idaho's livestock resources, any suspicion by fish and game
11 personnel of a potential communicable disease process in wildlife shall

27 purpose of augmenting existing populations until:
28 (i) The boards of county commissioners of the counties in
29 which the release is proposed to take place have been given
30 reasonable notice of the proposed release.
31 (ii) The affected federal and state land grazing permittees
32 and owners or leaseholders of private land in or contiguous
33 to the proposed release site have been given reasonable no-
34 tice of the proposed release.
35 (iii) The president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker
36 of the house of representatives have received from the di-
37 rector a plan for the forthcoming year that details, to the
38 best of the department's ability, the proposed transplants
39 which shall include the estimated numbers of bighorn sheep
40 to be transplanted and a description of the areas the pro-
41 posed transplant or transplants are planned for.
42 Upon request, the department shall grant one (1) hearing per
43 transplant or relocation if any affected individual or entity
44 expresses written concern within ten (10) days of notification re-
45 garding any transplants or relocations of bighorn sheep and shall
46 take into consideration these concerns in approving, modifying or
47 canceling any proposed bighorn sheep transplant or relocation.
48 Any such hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days of the re-
49 quest. It is the policy of the state of Idaho that existing sheep
50 or livestock operations in the area of any bighorn sheep trans-

6
1 plant or relocation are recognized and that the potential risk,
2 if any, of disease transmission and loss of bighorn sheep when the
3 same invade domestic livestock or sheep operations is accepted.
4 Prior to any transplant or relocation of bighorn sheep into ar-
5 eas they do not now inhabit or a transplant or relocation for the
6 purpose of augmenting existing populations, the department shall
7 provide for any affected federal or state land grazing permittees
8 or owners or leaseholders of private land a written agreement
9 signed by all federal, state and private entities responsible for
10 the transplant or relocation stating that the existing sheep or
11 livestock operations in the area of any such bighorn sheep trans-
12 plant or relocation are recognized and that the potential risk,
13 if any, of disease transmission and loss of bighorn sheep when the
14 same invade domestic livestock or sheep operations is accepted.
15 (E) The Idaho department of fish and game: (1) shall develop a
16 state management plan to maintain a viable, self-sustaining pop-
17 ulation of bighorn sheep in Idaho which shall consider as part
18 of the plan the current federal or state domestic sheep grazing
19 allotment(s) that currently have any bighorn sheep upon or in
20 proximity to the allotment(s); (2) within ninety (90) days of the
21 effective date of this act will cooperatively develop best manage-
22 ment practices with the permittee(s) on the allotment(s). Upon
23 commencement of the implementation of best management practices,
24 the director shall certify that the risk of disease transmission,
25 if any, between bighorn and domestic sheep is acceptable for the
26 viability of the bighorn sheep. The director's certification
27 shall continue for as long as the best management practices are
28 implemented. The director may also certify that the risk of dis-
29 ease transmission, if any, between bighorn and domestic sheep
30 is acceptable for the viability of the bighorn sheep based upon
31 a finding that other factors exist, including but not limited
32 to previous exposure to pathogens that make separation between
33 bighorn and domestic sheep unnecessary.
34 6.(A) The director shall have the power, at any time when it is
35 desired to introduce any new species, or if at any time any species
36 of wildlife of the state of Idaho shall be threatened with exces-
37 sive shooting, trapping, or angling or otherwise, to close any
38 open season or to reduce the bag limit or possession limit for such
39 species for such time as he may designate; in the event an emer-
40 gency is declared to exist, such closure shall become effective
41 forthwith upon written order of the director; in all other cases,
42 upon publication and posting as provided in section 36-105, Idaho
43 Code.
44 (B)(i) In order to protect property from damage by wildlife,
45 including bear and turkey, the fish and game commission
46 may delegate to the director or his designee the authority
47 to declare an open season upon that particular species of
48 wildlife to reduce its population. The director or his de-
49 signee shall make an order embodying his findings in respect
50 to when, under what circumstances, in which localities, by

7
1 what means, and in what amounts, numbers and sex the wildlife
2 subject to the hunt may be taken. In the event an emergency
3 is declared to exist, such open season shall become effec-
4 tive forthwith upon written order of the director or his
5 designee; in all other cases, upon publication and posting
6 as provided in section 36-105, Idaho Code.
7 (ii) In the event a kill permit is issued by the director
8 or his designee, the individual or landowner with the kill
9 permit, in conjunction with their responsibility for field
10 dressing the animals taken, may keep one (1) animal for their
11 personal use. In the event the director or his designee
12 issues a subsequent kill permit for the same individual or
13 landowner due to continued depredation, the director or his
14 designee may authorize the individual or landowner to keep a
15 second subsequently taken animal for their personal use.
16 (C) Any season closure order issued under authority hereof shall
17 be published in at least one (1) newspaper of general circulation
18 in the area affected by the order for at least once a week for two
19 (2) consecutive weeks, and such order shall be posted in public
20 places in each county as the director may direct.
21 (D) During the closure of any open season or the opening of any
22 special depredation season by the director, all provisions of laws
23 relating to the closed season or the special depredation season
24 on such wildlife shall be in force and whoever violates any of the
25 provisions shall be subject to the penalties prescribed therefor.
26 (E) Prior to the opening of any special depredation hunt, the di-
27 rector or his designee shall be authorized to provide up to a max-
28 imum of fifty percent (50%) of the available permits for such big
29 game to the landholder(s) of privately owned land within the hunt
30 area or his designees. If the landholder(s) chooses to designate
31 hunters, he must provide a written list of the names of designated
32 individuals to the department. If the landholder(s) fails to des-
33 ignate licensed hunters, then the department will issue the total
34 available permits in the manner set by rule. All hunters must have
35 a current hunting license and shall have equal access to both pub-
36 lic and private lands within the hunt boundaries. It shall be un-
37 lawful for any landholder(s) to receive any form of compensation
38 from a person who obtains or uses a depredation controlled hunt
39 permit.
40 7. The director shall make an annual report to the governor, the legis-
41 lature, and the secretary of state of the doings and conditions of his
42 office.
43 8. The director may sell or cause to be sold publications and materials
44 in accordance with section 59-1012, Idaho Code.
45 9. Any deer, elk, antelope, moose, bighorn sheep or bison imported or
46 transported by the department of fish and game shall be tested for the
47 presence of certain communicable diseases that can be transmitted to
48 domestic livestock. Those communicable diseases to be tested for shall
49 be arrived at by mutual agreement between the department of fish and
50 game and the department of agriculture. Any moneys expended by the de-

8
1 partment of fish and game on wildlife disease research shall be mutually
2 agreed upon by the department of fish and game and the department of
3 agriculture.
4 In addition, a comprehensive animal health program for all deer, elk,
5 antelope, moose, bighorn sheep, or bison imported into, transported, or
6 resident within the state of Idaho shall be implemented after said pro-
7 gram is mutually agreed upon by the department of fish and game and the
8 department of agriculture.
9 10. In order to monitor and evaluate the disease status of wildlife and
10 to protect Idaho's livestock resources, any suspicion by fish and game
11 personnel of a potential communicable disease process in wildlife shall
12 be reported within twenty-four (24) hours to the department of agricul-
13 ture. All samples collected for disease monitoring or disease evalu-
14 ation of wildlife shall be submitted to the division of animal indus-
15 tries, department of agriculture.
16 11.(A) The director is authorized to enter into an agreement with
17 an independent contractor for the purpose of providing a telephone
18 order and credit card payment service for controlled hunt permits,
19 licenses, tags, and permits.
20 (B) The contractor may collect a fee for its service in an amount
21 to be set by contract.

23 censes, tags, and permits shall be and remain the property of the
24 state, and such moneys shall be directly deposited by the con-

26 provisions of section 59-1014, Idaho Code. The contractor shall
27 furnish a good and sufficient surety bond to the state of Idaho in
28 an amount sufficient to cover the amount of the telephone orders
29 and potential refunds.

31 applications and licenses, tags, and permits approved by the de-
32 partment may be made by the contractor crediting the applicant's
33 or licensee's credit card account.
