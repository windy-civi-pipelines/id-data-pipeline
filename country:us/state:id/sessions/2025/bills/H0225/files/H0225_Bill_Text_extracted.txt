LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
HOUSE BILL NO. 225
BY EDUCATION COMMITTEE
1 AN ACT
2 RELATING TO EDUCATION; PROVIDING LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND LEGISLATIVE IN-
3 TENT; AMENDING CHAPTER 9, TITLE 33, IDAHO CODE, BY THE ADDITION OF A NEW
4 SECTION 33-919, IDAHO CODE, TO ESTABLISH THE SCHOOL MOBILE DEVICE POL-
5 ICY FUND; PROVIDING A SUNSET DATE; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND PRO-
6 VIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.
7 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
8 SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. (1) The Legislature finds
9 that:
10 (a) Student use of mobile devices in schools has had a multitude of
11 negative effects on student outcomes. Mobile devices can be a constant
12 distraction that disrupts the learning environment for all students.
13 (b) Mobile devices can increase harm to students' mental health by
14 recording students without consent or through increased cyberbullying.
15 Idaho students are still recovering from the massive effects of school
16 closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including severe learning loss
17 and troubling trends in student mental health.
18 (c) Student mobile device use should be as limited as possible during
19 school hours to reduce mobile device-related distractions in classroom
20 settings.
21 (2) It is the intent of the Legislature to encourage and assist school
22 districts and public charter schools in adopting bell-to-bell mobile device
23 restriction policies for K-12 students in Idaho. A bell-to-bell mobile de-
24 vice policy is a school policy that restricts access to a mobile device by
25 students in school from the beginning of the school day until the time stu-
26 dents are released from school at the end of the day, with certain exceptions
27 when devices may be required for educational purposes or for student health
28 and medical needs. This act creates the School Mobile Device Policy Fund
29 and a grant program to assist school districts and public charter schools
30 with the costs of purchasing equipment to store students' phones during the
31 school day and related services.
32 SECTION 2. That Chapter 9, Title 33, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
33 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
34 ignated as Section 33-919, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:

39 as need-based grants to school districts and public charter schools for the
40 purpose of offsetting costs associated with implementing polices that limit
41 the access to and use of mobile devices by students during school hours as
2

10 needs; and
11 (b) "Mobile device" means any personal portable wireless device not

8 dents during the school day when such contracts will result in equipment and
9 services being purchased at a lower cost. The office of the state board of
10 education may distribute such equipment or services directly to a grant ap-
11 plicant in lieu of distributing grant funds if such equipment or services are
12 of the type that the grant applicant is proposing to purchase with the grant
13 funds.
