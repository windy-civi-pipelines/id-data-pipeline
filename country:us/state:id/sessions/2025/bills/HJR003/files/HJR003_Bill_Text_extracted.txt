8 Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
9 SECTION 1. That the Legislature finds that:
10 (1) A primary legislative responsibility as stated in Section 24, Arti-
11 cle III of the Constitution of the State of Idaho is that the "first concern
12 of all good government is the virtue and sobriety of the people, and the pu-
13 rity of the home" and that the "legislature should further all wise and well
14 directed efforts for the promotion of temperance and morality";
15 (2) The legalization and normalization of unlawful drug use produces
16 negative health consequences, including but not limited to impaired fetal
17 and youth brain development, increases in addiction, psychosis, overdoses,
18 hospitalizations, and drug treatment services;
19 (3) The legalization and normalization of unlawful drug use produces
20 negative community health consequences, including but not limited to the
21 presence of cartels, increased human trafficking, more impaired drivers and
22 workers, and increased public consumption of drugs;
23 (4) The legalization and normalization of unlawful drug use produces
24 negative environmental health consequences, including but not limited to
25 illegal black market grow sites, trespassing on public and private lands,
26 and contamination of soil, water, and air from chemicals used in the growing
27 or manufacturing of unlawful drugs;
28 (5) The legalization and normalization of unlawful drug use produces
29 negative economic health consequences, including but not limited to in-
30 creases in workplace injuries, an increased burden on law enforcement, more
31 government bureaucracy, and potential government subsidies to protect legal
32 markets from the "black market";
33 (6) The decriminalization of unlawful drugs leads to de-facto legal-
34 ization that, in turn, can harm personal and public health, the environment,
35 the community, and the economy;
36 (7) In 2023, there were 105,700 drug overdose deaths in the United
37 States;
38 (8) Sound public policy promotes the health, safety, and welfare of the
39 citizens of Idaho through a drug-free environment where children, families,
