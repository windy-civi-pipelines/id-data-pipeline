IN THE SENATE
SENATE JOINT MEMORIAL NO. 104
BY STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
1 A JOINT MEMORIAL
2 TO THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES IN CON-
3 GRESS ASSEMBLED, TO THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION REPRESENTING THE
4 STATE OF IDAHO IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, AND TO THE INCOMING
5 DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE.
6 We, your Memorialists, the Senate and the House of Representatives of
7 the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Sixty-eighth
8 Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that:
9 WHEREAS, the Camas National Wildlife Refuge (Camas NWR) lies in south-
10 east Idaho and contains approximately 11,000 acres of land managed by the
11 United States Fish and Wildlife Service; and
12 WHEREAS, the Mud Lake Wildlife Management Area (Mud Lake WMA) is adja-
13 cent to the Camas NWR and contains approximately 11,500 acres of land managed
14 by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game; and
15 WHEREAS, the Camas NWR is hydraulically connected to the Mud Lake WMA
16 through Camas Creek, which flows through the Camas NWR, eventually ending in
17 Mud Lake; and
18 WHEREAS, historically, Mud Lake was seasonally flooded when Camas Creek
19 would overflow and create temporary wetlands, which would progressively
20 recharge the aquifer lying underground; and
21 WHEREAS, currently, agricultural fields now occupy areas that were his-
22 torically covered by seasonal wetlands; and
23 WHEREAS, such agricultural operations are dependent on valid, existing
24 water rights to appropriate water from or near Mud Lake; and
25 WHEREAS, over the years, Camas Creek has become obstructed by willows
26 and sedimentation building up such that water is not being properly deliv-
27 ered to the Mud Lake water users; and
28 WHEREAS, the federal permitting process to simply clean the Camas Creek
29 is a slow, cumbersome process, which would further injure Idaho water right
30 holders; and
31 WHEREAS, state permitting processes are much less onerous and time-con-
32 suming while achieving the same level of protection; and
33 WHEREAS, both the Camas NWR and the Mud Lake WMA are managed as wildlife
34 sanctuaries for migratory and non-migratory birds and big and small game an-
35 imals; and
36 WHEREAS, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game has successfully managed
37 the Mud Lake WMA for decades, with the assistance of federal Pittman-Robert-
38 son wildlife restoration funds.
39 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular
40 Session of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of
41 Representatives concurring therein, that the Legislature requests that the
42 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and any other federal agencies partaking in

2
1 the federal permitting process to clean Camas Creek, promptly process and
2 authorize the forthcoming permit application.
3 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature requests that the U.S. Fish
4 and Wildlife Service and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game work together
5 to transfer ownership and administration of the Camas National Wildlife
6 Refuge to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game for incorporation into the
7 Mud Lake Wildlife Management Area so that the entire area can be more effec-
8 tively and efficiently managed.
9 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is
10 hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the
11 President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of
12 Congress, to the congressional delegation representing the State of Idaho in
13 the Congress of the United States, and to the incoming director of the United
14 States Fish and Wildlife Service.
