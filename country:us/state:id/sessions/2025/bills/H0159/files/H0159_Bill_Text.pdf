43 of the child to bring the child before the court at the adjudicatory hearing
44 held in accordance with section 16-1619, Idaho Code. Each parent or guardian
45 shall also be notified in the manner hereinafter provided of the pendency of
46 the case and the time and place set for the hearing. A summons shall be is-
47 sued and served requiring the appearance of each parent and legal guardian,

6 todian of their right to retain and be represented by counsel. Each parent

9 (4) If based on facts presented to the court, it appears that the court
10 has jurisdiction upon the grounds set forth in section 16-1603, Idaho Code,

12 tion or surroundings because continuation in such condition or surroundings
13 would be contrary to the welfare of the child and vesting legal custody with
14 the department or other authorized agency would be in the child's best in-
15 terests, the court shall include on the summons an order to remove the child.
16 The order to remove the child shall specifically state that continuation in
17 the present condition or surroundings is contrary to the welfare of the child

22 or surroundings and it is not in his best interest to remove him at this
23 time, the court may issue a protective order based on an affidavit pend-
24 ing the adjudicatory hearing. If the child is in joint custody, the pro-
25 tective order shall state with specificity the rights and responsibil-
26 ities of each parent. Each parent shall be provided with a copy of the
27 protective order. If there is reasonable cause to believe that a child
28 would be safe in the child's present surroundings in the sole care of one
29 (1) parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian and neglect or abuse by
30 another parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian is alleged, then a
31 prosecutor or the attorney general may file a motion with the court for
32 an order to prevent removal of the child that excludes the alleged of-
33 fending parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian from the residence
34 where the child resides. If the court finds reasonable cause to believe
35 that such elements have been demonstrated, the court shall issue an or-
36 der that shall exclude the alleged offending parent, legal guardian, or
37 legal custodian from the dwelling where the child resides, restrain any
38 contact or communication with the child, and restrain the alleged of-
39 fending parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian from coming within
40 one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet, or other appropriate distance,
41 of the child until further order of the court.
42 (b) A motion filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be
43 accompanied by a sworn affidavit from a law enforcement officer or the
44 department.
45 (c) A copy of an order to prevent removal along with a copy of the peti-
46 tion and summons shall be served on the alleged offending parent, legal
47 guardian, or legal custodian, and all parents, legal guardians, or le-
48 gal custodians shall receive notice of a hearing on whether to continue
49 an order within forty-eight (48) hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays,
50 and holidays.

5 tion (1) of this section;
6 (ii) There is reasonable cause to believe the child is safe in
7 the child's current surroundings in the sole care of one (1) par-
8 ent, legal guardian, or legal custodian but has been neglected or
9 abused by the other parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian;
10 and
11 (iii) Continuation of the order is in the child's best interest.

13 be guilty of misdemeanor criminal contempt, as described in section

22 shall be given notice of the shelter care hearing. Such notice shall include
23 the time, place, and purpose of the hearing; and, that such person is enti-
24 tled to be represented by legal counsel. Notice as required by this subsec-
25 tion shall be given at least twenty-four (24) hours before the shelter care

31 vice need not be made where the undelivered notice is returned to the court
32 along with an affidavit stating that such parents or custodian could not be
33 located or were out of the state.

35 request by the parent, custodian or counsel for the child.
36 (5) If, upon the completion of the shelter care hearing, it is shown
37 that:
38 (a) A petition has been filed; and
39 (b) There is reasonable cause to believe the child comes within the ju-

4 ter care order placing the child in the temporary legal custody of the de-
5 partment or other authorized agency. Any evidence may be considered by the
6 court which is of the type which reasonable people may rely upon.

17 ment's efforts to place the siblings together, or if the department has
18 not placed or will not be placing the siblings together, about a plan
19 to ensure frequent visitation or ongoing interaction among the sib-
20 lings, unless visitation or ongoing interaction would be contrary to
21 the safety or well-being of one (1) or more of the siblings.
22 (8) If there is reasonable cause to believe that the child comes within
23 the jurisdiction of the court under this chapter, but a reasonable effort to
24 prevent placement of the child outside the home could be affected by a pro-
25 tective order safeguarding the child's welfare, the court may issue, within

45 conference.
46 (3) At the adjudicatory hearing, parents or guardians with disabil-
47 ities shall have the right to introduce admissible evidence regarding how
48 use of adaptive equipment or supportive services may enable the parent or

10
1 guardian to carry out the responsibilities of parenting the child by ad-
2 dressing the reason for the removal of the child.
3 (4) If a preponderance of the evidence at the adjudicatory hearing
4 shows that the child comes within the court's jurisdiction under this chap-
5 ter upon the grounds set forth in section 16-1603, Idaho Code, the court
6 shall so decree and in its decree shall make a finding on the record of the
7 facts and conclusions of law upon which it exercises jurisdiction over the
8 child.
9 (5) Upon entering its decree, the court shall consider any information
10 relevant to the disposition of the child but in any event shall:
11 (a) Place the child under the protective supervision of the department
12 for an indeterminate period not to exceed the child's eighteenth birth-
13 day; or
14 (b) Vest legal custody in the department or other authorized agency
15 subject to residual parental rights and subject to full judicial re-
16 view by the court and, when contested by any party, judicial approval
17 of all matters relating to the custody of the child by the department
18 or other authorized agency. If the department has placed the child in
19 a qualified residential treatment program, the court shall approve or
20 disapprove the placement within sixty (60) days of placement in accor-
21 dance with section 16-1619A, Idaho Code.
22 (6) If the court vests legal custody in the department or other autho-
23 rized agency, the court shall make detailed written findings based on facts
24 in the record that, in addition to the findings required in subsection (4) of
25 this section, continuation of residence in the home would be contrary to the
26 welfare of the child and that vesting legal custody with the department or
27 other authorized agency would be in the best interests of the child. In ad-
28 dition, the court shall make detailed written findings based on facts in the
29 record as to whether the department made reasonable efforts to prevent the
30 placement of the child in foster care, including findings, when appropriate,
31 that:
32 (a) Reasonable efforts were made but were not successful in eliminating
33 the need for foster care placement of the child;
34 (b) The department made reasonable efforts to prevent removal but was
35 not able to safely provide preventive services;
36 (c) Reasonable efforts to temporarily place the child with related per-
37 sons were made but were not successful; or
38 (d) Reasonable efforts to reunify the child with one (1) or both parents
39 were not required because aggravated circumstances were present. If
40 aggravated circumstances are found, a permanency hearing for the child
41 shall be held within thirty (30) days of the determination of aggravated
42 circumstances.
43 (7)(a) The court shall also inquire regarding:
44 (i) Whether there is reason to believe that the child is an Indian
45 child;
46 (ii) The efforts that have been made since the last hearing to de-
47 termine whether the child is an Indian child; and
48 (iii) The department's efforts to work with all tribes of which the
49 child may be a member to verify whether the child is a member or el-
50 igible for membership.

11
1 (b) In addition, if the court vests legal custody of the child in the
2 department or other authorized agency, the court shall inquire as to:
3 (i) If the child is of school age, the department's efforts to
4 keep the child in the school at which the child is currently en-
5 rolled; and
6 (ii) If a sibling group was removed from the home, the depart-
7 ment's efforts to place the siblings together, or if the depart-
8 ment has not placed or will not be placing the siblings together,
9 about a plan to ensure frequent visitation or ongoing interac-
10 tion among the siblings, unless visitation or ongoing interaction
11 would be contrary to the safety or well-being of one (1) or more of
12 the siblings.
13 (c) If the court vests legal custody of the child in the department
14 or other authorized agency and the child is being treated with psy-
15 chotropic medication, these additional requirements shall apply:
16 (i) The department shall report to the court the medications and
17 dosages prescribed for the child and the medical professional who
18 prescribed the medication; and
19 (ii) The court shall inquire about and may make any additional in-
20 quiry relevant to the use of psychotropic medications.
21 (8) A decree vesting legal custody in the department shall be binding
22 upon the department and may continue until the child's eighteenth birthday.
23 (9) A decree vesting legal custody in an authorized agency other than
24 the department shall be for a period of time not to exceed the child's eigh-
25 teenth birthday and on such other terms as the court shall state in its decree
26 to be in the best interests of the child and which the court finds to be ac-
27 ceptable to such authorized agency.
28 (10) In order to preserve the unity of the family system and to ensure
29 the best interests of the child, whether issuing an order of protective su-
30 pervision or an order of legal custody, the court may consider extending or
31 initiating a protective order as part of the decree. The protective order
32 shall be determined as in the best interests of the child and upon a showing
33 of continuing danger to the child. The conditions and terms of the protec-
34 tive order shall be clearly stated in the decree.
35 (11) (10) If the court does not find that the child comes within the ju-
36 risdiction of this chapter pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, it
37 shall dismiss the petition.
38 (12) (11) Where legal custody of a child is vested in the department,
39 any party or counsel for a child may, at or after the disposition phase of
40 an adjudicatory hearing, file and serve a written motion to contest matters
41 relating to the placement of the child by the department. The hearing must
42 be held no later than thirty (30) days from the date the motion was filed.
43 If the court approves the placement, the court shall enter an order denying
44 the motion. If the court does not approve the placement, the court shall en-
45 ter an order directing the department to identify and implement an alterna-
46 tive placement in accordance with applicable law. The court shall consider
47 everything necessary or proper in the best interests of the children. The
48 court shall consider all relevant factors, which may include:
49 (a) The wishes of the child regarding the child's custodian;

12
1 (b) The wishes of the child's parent or parents regarding the child's
2 custody, if appropriate;
3 (c) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with his parent
4 or parents or foster parent or foster parents, and the child's siblings;
5 (d) The child's adjustment to his home, school and community;
6 (e) The character and circumstances of all individuals involved;
7 (f) The need to promote continuity and stability in the life of the
8 child; and
9 (g) A history of domestic violence as defined in section 39-6303, Idaho
10 Code, whether or not in the presence of the child, or a conviction for
11 lewd and lascivious conduct or felony injury to a child.
12 SECTION 6. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
13 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
14 July 1, 2025.
