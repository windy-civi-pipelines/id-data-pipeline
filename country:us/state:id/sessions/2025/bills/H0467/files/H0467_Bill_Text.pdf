16 beginning a program shall receive priority placement on the waiting list for
17 appropriate programs at the new facility.

19 suant to subsection (1) of this section shall be applied toward a reduction
20 of the indeterminate period of an eligible individual's sentence or term of
21 felony probation or parole. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted
22 as reducing the minimum period of confinement required by section 19-2513,
23 Idaho Code. Credit shall not reduce a sentence to any period prior to the
24 initial parole eligibility date.
25 (5)(a) Forfeiture. If an eligible individual is subject to misconduct,
26 nonperformance, or disciplinary action, credits awarded in the last
27 year pursuant to subsection (1) of this section may be forfeited accord-
28 ing to the policies and procedures developed by the department. The
29 decision of the director regarding forfeiture of credits shall be final
30 and not appealable. All credits shall be forfeited under the following
31 circumstances:
32 (i) If the individual is convicted of a new felony, including but
33 not limited to battery of a department or commission employee or
34 contractor or law enforcement officer; or
35 (ii) If the individual's parole is revoked for purposes other than
36 a technical violation.
37 (b) Earned credits forfeited for misconduct, nonperformance, or disci-
38 plinary action may be restored as provided by department policy, which
39 may allow for automatic restoration of sentence credits following a pe-
40 riod in which the individual maintains a record without a disciplinary
41 violation. Credits forfeited pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) of this
42 subsection may be restored at the discretion of the commission.
43 (6) Records. The department shall make the modified sentence satis-
44 faction date of each eligible individual available on its website or upon
45 request. The modified sentence satisfaction date means the date an eligi-
46 ble individual would satisfy his sentence if all credits thus far awarded
47 to the individual pursuant to this section were applied without forfeiture.
48 Any credit forfeited shall no longer be counted toward the modified sentence
49 satisfaction date. The modified sentence satisfaction date shall be subject
50 to the limitations set forth in subsection (4) of this section.

1 (7) Pre-earned credit. The director may award credit pursuant to sub-
2 section (1)(a) and (d) of this section on a case-by-case basis to eligible
3 individuals for programs or actions undertaken during the term of incarcera-
4 tion up to ten (10) years prior to enactment of this section.
5 (8) No right of action. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as
6 creating a right for any individual to any credit toward a reduction of his
7 sentence. Any reduction credited to an individual prior to satisfying his
8 sentence may be forfeited, in whole or in part, by the director according to
9 the rules of the board. No action may be maintained against the board, any
10 of its members, or the director in any court in connection with the granting
11 or forfeiture of any credit toward a sentence reduction pursuant to this sec-
12 tion, and the same shall not be liable in any way for any action with respect
13 to the forfeiture.

15 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
16 July 1, 2025.
