8 SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the Legislature to
9 recognize that computation is a form of personal expression, and as such
10 takes on the protections and responsibilities of free speech. Furthermore,
11 artificial intelligence (AI) inference models, training data, algorithms,
12 and supporting parameters are recognized as an extension of human thought
13 and creativity, subject to the same protections and responsibilities of
14 free speech. The development and refinement of AI systems must be free from
15 excessive regulation, allowing for innovation and improvement through dis-
16 tributed continuous iteration and experimentation.
17 SECTION 2. That Title 67, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended
18 by the addition thereto of a NEW CHAPTER, to be known and designated as Chap-
19 ter 98, Title 67, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:

24 putation that is an engineered or machine-based system that varies in its
25 level of autonomy and can, in response to explicit or implicit objectives,
26 infer or otherwise algorithmically determine from the input it receives how
27 to generate outputs that can influence physical or virtual environments.
28 (2) "Computation" means machine-based algorithmic data processing or
29 manipulation.
30 (3) "General purpose technology" means a foundational engineered or
31 machine-based system without explicit use case, but that provides a founda-
