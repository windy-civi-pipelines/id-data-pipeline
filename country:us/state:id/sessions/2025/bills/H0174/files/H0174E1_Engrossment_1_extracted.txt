32 without the express or implied consent of the owner or person in lawful pos-
33 session or control of the property.
34 49-1802. PRESUMED RESPONSIBILITY. (1) The abandonment of any vehicle
35 shall create a prima facie presumption that the last registered owner of
36 record is responsible for the abandonment and is thereby liable for the costs
37 incurred in the removal, storage, and disposition of the vehicle, less any
38 amount received from the disposition of the vehicle.
39 (2) The owner of any vehicle removed pursuant to this chapter is
40 presumed responsible for the vehicle and is thereby liable for the costs
2
1 incurred in the removal, storage, and disposition of the vehicle, less any
2 amounts received from the disposition of the vehicle.
3 (3) If a vehicle is found abandoned or found under extraordinary cir-
4 cumstances and is removed at the direction of any authorized officer and is
5 not redeemed by the owner or lienholder within seven (7) days of the tow, the
6 last registered owner of record is guilty of a traffic infraction, unless the
7 owner has filed a release of liability with the department pursuant to sec-
8 tion 49-526, Idaho Code, in which case the transferee shown on the release of
9 liability shall be guilty of a traffic infraction.
10 (4) Vehicles towed under the provisions of this chapter cannot be dis-
11 posed of without a title or a junk certificate.
12 (5) If a law enforcement agency places a call or requests a tow company
13 to remove a vehicle, it shall be classified as a law enforcement-directed tow
14 and the provisions of this chapter shall apply.
15 49-1803. REMOVAL OF STOLEN VEHICLES. (1) Any authorized officer, upon
16 discovery of a vehicle reported as stolen and not recovered, may cause it to
17 be taken to and stored in an authorized impound yard in the custody of a tow
18 company.
19 (2) Within forty-eight (48) hours, excluding weekends and holidays, of
20 the time that the vehicle is taken into custody and is stored pursuant to this
21 section, the agency of which the officer is an agent shall make a reason-
22 able effort to obtain the vehicle owner information from the agency that the
23 stolen vehicle report was filed with and contact the owner by email or phone.
24 If contact is made and no action is taken by the owner or insurance company
25 within seven (7) days or no contact is made within forty-eight (48) hours,
26 the agency shall give written notice by certified mail to the registered and
27 legal owners of the vehicle, if known. The notice shall state:
28 (a) That the vehicle has been taken into custody and stored;
29 (b) The location of storage of the vehicle;

32 fication number, license number, and state of registration; and

35 considered stolen and not recovered and treated as an abandoned vehicle,
36 subject to the provisions of section 49-1807, Idaho Code. The storage time
37 accrued under this section may be added to the storage time required through
38 the abandoned vehicle process, pursuant to section 49-1814(3), Idaho Code,
39 if the vehicle was stored at a tow company facility during the stolen vehicle
40 investigation and notification process.
41 49-1804. REMOVAL OF ACCIDENTS -- DRIVER ARRESTS -- VEHICLES FOUND UN-
42 DER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. Any authorized officer who dispatches a
43 call to request the removal of a vehicle under the authority of this chapter

45 dent, the driver being arrested, or other extraordinary circumstances may

5 shall contain:

14 of the department prior to the expiration of the forty-eight (48) hour no-
15 tice period. Such notice shall include the location of the vehicle and the
16 time and date of intent to remove the vehicle. The inability of an officer to

18 tion of the forty-eight (48) hour period provided for in this section.

22 lease the vehicle at the scene. If the vehicle is attached to the tow truck,
23 or otherwise in tow, the regular, scheduled tow fee may be charged. When the
24 vehicle is not yet in tow at the time of request, the release must be made,
25 and no charge may be assessed except a customary and reasonable charge for
26 mileage one way from the towing company's place of storage to the scene plus

35 ing or booting the vehicle.
36 (2) Unauthorized removal of any vehicle towed or booted under the pro-
37 visions of this chapter without payment in full of all charges and costs that
38 have been incurred under the provisions of this chapter shall be a misde-
39 meanor, and the vehicle may be recovered and returned to the place of stor-
40 age.
41 (3) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to abate any cause of ac-
42 tion that a lienholder has against the owner of an abandoned vehicle.
43 (4) Any insurer having a claim made against it pertaining to any vehicle
44 removed or booted under the provisions of this chapter, except those vehi-
45 cles impounded for investigation or suspected stolen, may take possession of
46 the vehicle at any time prior to the settlement of such claim following de-
47 termination by such insurer that the vehicle has been determined by such in-
48 surer to be a total loss, obtaining verbal consent of the owner and by paying
7
1 the lawfully entitled costs relative to towing and storing the vehicle. The
2 insurer holding facility shall allow the vehicle owner or his representative
3 access to the vehicle upon the vehicle owner or his representative provid-
4 ing evidence of ownership. Personal property, including items not attached
5 or related to the vehicle, must be returned to the vehicle owner pursuant
6 to section 49-1814(4), Idaho Code. If no total loss settlement is reached,
7 the insurer shall return the vehicle to a mutually agreed upon location. Any
8 holding facility that releases a vehicle pursuant to the provisions of this
9 subsection shall be held harmless for the release of such vehicle. The in-
10 surer shall provide the location and telephone number of the insurer holding

12 (5) Any towing company that tows a vehicle pursuant to this chapter
13 shall take the vehicle to such place as the owner or his authorized agent
14 with a power of attorney may reasonably request. If such a request is not
15 received, the towing company shall take the vehicle to its nearest place of
16 safe storage. The towing company shall not be entitled to recover any stor-
17 age fees, impound fees, unauthorized repair fees, or other fees, except the
18 scheduled tow fee, if the towing company:

20 or as reasonably requested by the owner or his authorized agent with a
21 power of attorney;
22 (b) After removing the vehicle, refuses to release the vehicle to the
23 owner, his authorized agent, insurance representative, or lienholder
24 for any reason other than the refusal of the owner, authorized agent,
25 insurance representative, or lienholder to pay the fees to which the
26 towing company is lawfully entitled. The refusal of the owner, his
27 authorized agent, insurance representative, or lienholder to pay fees
28 to which the towing company is not entitled pursuant to this subsection
29 shall not be cause for the tow company to refuse to release the vehicle;
30 or
31 (c) Performs repairs or makes improvements, for any reason, without a
32 signed work order or recorded verbal consent from the owner, his autho-
33 rized agent, insurance representative, or lienholder.

28 45-805. LIENS FOR SERVICES ON OR CARING FOR PROPERTY. (a) Every person
29 who, while lawfully in possession of an article of personal property, ren-
30 ders any service to the owner thereof, by labor, or skill, employed for the
31 protection, improvement, safekeeping, or carriage thereof, has a special
32 lien thereon, dependent on possession, for the compensation, if any, which
33 is due him from the owner, for such service. If the liens as herein provided
34 are not paid within sixty (60) days after the work is done, service rendered
35 or materials supplied, the person in whose favor such special lien is cre-
36 ated may proceed to sell the property at a public auction after giving ten
37 (10) days' public notice of the sale by advertising in some newspaper pub-
38 lished in the county where the property is situated, or if there is no news-
39 paper published in the county then by posting notices of the sale in three
40 (3) of the most public places in the county for ten (10) days previous to such
41 sale. The person shall also send the notice of auction to the owner or owners
42 of the property and to the holder or holders of a perfected security interest
43 in the property as provided in subsection (c) of this section. The person who
44 is about to render any service to the owner of an article of personal prop-
45 erty by labor or skill employed for the protection, improvement, safekeeping
46 or carriage thereof may take priority over a prior perfected security inter-
47 est by, before commencing any such service, giving notice of the intention
10
1 to render such service to any holder of a prior perfected security interest
2 at least three (3) days before rendering such service. If the holder of the
3 security interest does not notify said person, within three (3) days that it
4 does not consent to the performance of such services, then the person render-
5 ing such service may proceed and the lien provided for herein shall attach to
6 the property as a superior lien. The provisions of this section shall not ap-
7 ply to a motor vehicle subject to the provisions of sections 49-1809 through
8 49-1818 chapter 18, title 49, Idaho Code.

27 CHAPTER 18
28 TOWING AND STORAGE OF MOTOR VEHICLES
29 49-1801. ABANDONMENT PROHIBITED. (1) No person shall abandon a vehi-
30 cle upon any highway.
31 (2) No person shall abandon a vehicle upon public or private property
32 without the express or implied consent of the owner or person in lawful pos-
33 session or control of the property.
34 49-1802. PRESUMED RESPONSIBILITY. (1) The abandonment of any vehicle
35 shall create a prima facie presumption that the last registered owner of
36 record is responsible for the abandonment and is thereby liable for the costs
37 incurred in the removal, storage, and disposition of the vehicle, less any
38 amount received from the disposition of the vehicle.
39 (2) The owner of any vehicle removed pursuant to this chapter is
40 presumed responsible for the vehicle and is thereby liable for the costs

2
1 incurred in the removal, storage, and disposition of the vehicle, less any
2 amounts received from the disposition of the vehicle.
3 (3) If a vehicle is found abandoned or found under extraordinary cir-
4 cumstances and is removed at the direction of any authorized officer and is
5 not redeemed by the owner or lienholder within seven (7) days of the tow, the
6 last registered owner of record is guilty of a traffic infraction, unless the
7 owner has filed a release of liability with the department pursuant to sec-
8 tion 49-526, Idaho Code, in which case the transferee shown on the release of
9 liability shall be guilty of a traffic infraction.
10 (4) Vehicles towed under the provisions of this chapter cannot be dis-
11 posed of without a title or a junk certificate.
12 (5) If a law enforcement agency places a call or requests a tow company
13 to remove a vehicle, it shall be classified as a law enforcement-directed tow
14 and the provisions of this chapter shall apply.
15 49-1803. REMOVAL OF STOLEN VEHICLES. (1) Any authorized officer, upon
16 discovery of a vehicle reported as stolen and not recovered, may cause it to
17 be taken to and stored in an authorized impound yard in the custody of a tow
18 company.
19 (2) Within forty-eight (48) hours, excluding weekends and holidays, of
20 the time that the vehicle is taken into custody and is stored pursuant to this
21 section, the agency of which the officer is an agent shall make a reason-
22 able effort to obtain the vehicle owner information from the agency that the
23 stolen vehicle report was filed with and contact the owner by email or phone.
24 If contact is made and no action is taken by the owner or insurance company
25 within seven (7) days or no contact is made within forty-eight (48) hours,
26 the agency shall give written notice by certified mail to the registered and
27 legal owners of the vehicle, if known. The notice shall state:
28 (a) That the vehicle has been taken into custody and stored;
29 (b) The location of storage of the vehicle;
30 (c) The identification of the officer;
31 (d) A description of the vehicle, including make, year, model, identi-
32 fication number, license number, and state of registration; and
33 (e) The statutory authority for storage.
34 (3) If the vehicle is not claimed within thirty (30) days, it shall be
35 considered stolen and not recovered and treated as an abandoned vehicle,
36 subject to the provisions of section 49-1807, Idaho Code. The storage time
37 accrued under this section may be added to the storage time required through
38 the abandoned vehicle process, pursuant to section 49-1814(3), Idaho Code,
39 if the vehicle was stored at a tow company facility during the stolen vehicle
40 investigation and notification process.
41 49-1804. REMOVAL OF ACCIDENTS -- DRIVER ARRESTS -- VEHICLES FOUND UN-
42 DER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. Any authorized officer who dispatches a
43 call to request the removal of a vehicle under the authority of this chapter
44 or the provisions of section 49-662, Idaho Code, as the result of an acci-
45 dent, the driver being arrested, or other extraordinary circumstances may
46 immediately cause the vehicle to be placed in the custody of a tow company.

3
1 49-1805. REMOVAL OF ROADSIDE ABANDONED VEHICLES. (1) Upon discovery
2 of an abandoned vehicle other than under extraordinary circumstances, an
3 authorized officer shall attach on the vehicle, in plain view, a notice that
4 the vehicle will be towed away after forty-eight (48) hours. The notice
5 shall contain:
6 (a) The name of the officer who prepared the notice;
7 (b) The name of the agency employing the officer;
8 (c) The time and date of attaching the notice;
9 (d) The time and date after which the vehicle will be removed; and
10 (e) The telephone number and address of the agency where further infor-
11 mation can be obtained.
12 (2) A reasonable attempt shall be made to notify the owner of any vehi-
13 cle that has current license plates and registration as shown on the records
14 of the department prior to the expiration of the forty-eight (48) hour no-
15 tice period. Such notice shall include the location of the vehicle and the
16 time and date of intent to remove the vehicle. The inability of an officer to
17 notify the owner shall not preclude the removal of the vehicle at the expira-
18 tion of the forty-eight (48) hour period provided for in this section.
19 49-1806. REMOVAL OR BOOTING OF UNAUTHORIZED AND ABANDONED VEHICLES
20 FROM REAL PROPERTY. (1) Any person having possession or control of real
21 property, including commercial property, who finds an unauthorized vehicle
22 standing on his property is permitted to have the vehicle removed or booted
23 if there is posted on or near the property in a clearly conspicuous location,
24 in large print, a sign or notice that unauthorized vehicles will be removed
25 or booted at the owner's expense and designating the name of the towing firm.
26 Unauthorized vehicles need not meet the provisions of section 49-102(2),
27 Idaho Code, in this instance.
28 (2) Any person having possession or control of real property, excluding
29 commercial property, who finds an abandoned vehicle standing on his prop-
30 erty when the property is not posted as set out in subsection (1) of this sec-
31 tion may contact a tow company to remove the vehicle. The tow company shall
32 have the person having possession or control of the property sign a release
33 form to the tow company identifying himself as the person having possession
34 or control of real property, identifying the vehicle being removed, and tak-
35 ing responsibility for the removal of the vehicle.
36 (3) No vehicle shall be considered unauthorized and subject to removal
37 or booting pursuant to the provisions of this subsection solely on the basis
38 of the vehicle having expired or improper vehicle registration. All other
39 provisions of this chapter shall be complied with.
40 49-1807. TOWED VEHICLE REMOVAL AND NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. (1)
41 Whenever a vehicle is towed pursuant to sections 49-1803 through 49-1806,
42 Idaho Code, the following procedures shall be followed:

20 rized officer, except vehicles towed as part of an investigation or that are
21 suspected stolen, shall upon request of the owner or his authorized agent re-
22 lease the vehicle at the scene. If the vehicle is attached to the tow truck,
23 or otherwise in tow, the regular, scheduled tow fee may be charged. When the
24 vehicle is not yet in tow at the time of request, the release must be made,
25 and no charge may be assessed except a customary and reasonable charge for
26 mileage one way from the towing company's place of storage to the scene plus
27 the usual fee for the tow truck operator. If the authorized fee is not ten-
28 dered by the owner or his agent, the towing operator may complete the im-
29 poundment, towing, or removal, as authorized.
30 49-1811. CLAIMING OF VEHICLE -- REFUSAL TO RELEASE VEHICLE. (1) The
31 owner or lienholder of any vehicle removed or booted under the provisions
32 of this chapter, except those vehicles impounded for investigation or sus-
33 pected stolen, may take possession of the vehicle at any time prior to dispo-
34 sition by proving ownership and paying the costs relative to towing and stor-
35 ing or booting the vehicle.
36 (2) Unauthorized removal of any vehicle towed or booted under the pro-
37 visions of this chapter without payment in full of all charges and costs that
38 have been incurred under the provisions of this chapter shall be a misde-
39 meanor, and the vehicle may be recovered and returned to the place of stor-
40 age.
41 (3) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to abate any cause of ac-
42 tion that a lienholder has against the owner of an abandoned vehicle.
43 (4) Any insurer having a claim made against it pertaining to any vehicle
44 removed or booted under the provisions of this chapter, except those vehi-
45 cles impounded for investigation or suspected stolen, may take possession of
46 the vehicle at any time prior to the settlement of such claim following de-
47 termination by such insurer that the vehicle has been determined by such in-
48 surer to be a total loss, obtaining verbal consent of the owner and by paying

7
1 the lawfully entitled costs relative to towing and storing the vehicle. The
2 insurer holding facility shall allow the vehicle owner or his representative
3 access to the vehicle upon the vehicle owner or his representative provid-
4 ing evidence of ownership. Personal property, including items not attached
5 or related to the vehicle, must be returned to the vehicle owner pursuant
6 to section 49-1814(4), Idaho Code. If no total loss settlement is reached,
7 the insurer shall return the vehicle to a mutually agreed upon location. Any
8 holding facility that releases a vehicle pursuant to the provisions of this
9 subsection shall be held harmless for the release of such vehicle. The in-
10 surer shall provide the location and telephone number of the insurer holding
11 facility to the vehicle owner or his representative.
12 (5) Any towing company that tows a vehicle pursuant to this chapter
13 shall take the vehicle to such place as the owner or his authorized agent
14 with a power of attorney may reasonably request. If such a request is not
15 received, the towing company shall take the vehicle to its nearest place of
16 safe storage. The towing company shall not be entitled to recover any stor-
17 age fees, impound fees, unauthorized repair fees, or other fees, except the
18 scheduled tow fee, if the towing company:
19 (a) Removes the vehicle to a place other than as directed by the officer
20 or as reasonably requested by the owner or his authorized agent with a
21 power of attorney;
22 (b) After removing the vehicle, refuses to release the vehicle to the
23 owner, his authorized agent, insurance representative, or lienholder
24 for any reason other than the refusal of the owner, authorized agent,
25 insurance representative, or lienholder to pay the fees to which the
26 towing company is lawfully entitled. The refusal of the owner, his
27 authorized agent, insurance representative, or lienholder to pay fees
28 to which the towing company is not entitled pursuant to this subsection
29 shall not be cause for the tow company to refuse to release the vehicle;
30 or
31 (c) Performs repairs or makes improvements, for any reason, without a
32 signed work order or recorded verbal consent from the owner, his autho-
33 rized agent, insurance representative, or lienholder.
34 (6) Upon release of the vehicle to the legal or registered owner, autho-
35 rized agent, or insurance representative, the towing company shall provide
36 an itemized statement containing the following:
37 (a) The location from which the vehicle was towed;

28 45-805. LIENS FOR SERVICES ON OR CARING FOR PROPERTY. (a) Every person
29 who, while lawfully in possession of an article of personal property, ren-
30 ders any service to the owner thereof, by labor, or skill, employed for the
31 protection, improvement, safekeeping, or carriage thereof, has a special
32 lien thereon, dependent on possession, for the compensation, if any, which
33 is due him from the owner, for such service. If the liens as herein provided
34 are not paid within sixty (60) days after the work is done, service rendered
35 or materials supplied, the person in whose favor such special lien is cre-
36 ated may proceed to sell the property at a public auction after giving ten
37 (10) days' public notice of the sale by advertising in some newspaper pub-
38 lished in the county where the property is situated, or if there is no news-
39 paper published in the county then by posting notices of the sale in three
40 (3) of the most public places in the county for ten (10) days previous to such
41 sale. The person shall also send the notice of auction to the owner or owners
42 of the property and to the holder or holders of a perfected security interest
43 in the property as provided in subsection (c) of this section. The person who
44 is about to render any service to the owner of an article of personal prop-
45 erty by labor or skill employed for the protection, improvement, safekeeping
46 or carriage thereof may take priority over a prior perfected security inter-
47 est by, before commencing any such service, giving notice of the intention

10
1 to render such service to any holder of a prior perfected security interest
2 at least three (3) days before rendering such service. If the holder of the
3 security interest does not notify said person, within three (3) days that it
4 does not consent to the performance of such services, then the person render-
5 ing such service may proceed and the lien provided for herein shall attach to
6 the property as a superior lien. The provisions of this section shall not ap-
7 ply to a motor vehicle subject to the provisions of sections 49-1809 through
8 49-1818 chapter 18, title 49, Idaho Code.
9 (b) Livery or boarding or feed stable proprietors, and persons pastur-
10 ing livestock of any kind, have a lien, dependent on possession, for their
11 compensation in caring for, boarding, feeding or pasturing such livestock.
12 If the liens as herein provided are not paid within sixty (60) days after the
13 work is done, service rendered, or feed or pasturing supplied, the person in
14 whose favor such special lien is created may proceed to sell the property at
15 a licensed public livestock auction market, or if the lien is on equines, to
16 sell the animals at a sale offered to the public, after giving ten (10) days'
17 notice to the owner or owners of the livestock and the state brand inspector.
18 The information contained in such notice shall be verified and contain the
19 following:
20 (1) The time, place and date of the licensed public livestock auction
21 market, or in the case of equines, the time, place and date of the sale
22 offered to the public;
23 (2) The name, address and phone number of the person claiming the lien;
24 (3) The name, address and phone number of the owner or owners of the
25 livestock upon which the lien has been placed;
26 (4) The number, breed and current brand of the livestock upon which the
27 lien has been placed; and
28 (5) A statement by the lienor that the requirements of this section have
29 been met.
30 (c) Notices provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall
31 be made by personal service or by certified or registered mail to the last
32 known address of the owner or owners and any holder of a prior perfected secu-
33 rity interest. The proceeds of the sale must be applied to the discharge of
34 any prior perfected security interest, the lien created by this section and
35 costs; the remainder, if any, must be paid over to the owner.
36 SECTION 4. This act shall be in full force and effect on and after Jan-
37 uary 1, 2026.
