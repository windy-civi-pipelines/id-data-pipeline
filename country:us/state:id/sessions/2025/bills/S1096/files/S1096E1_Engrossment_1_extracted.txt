28 fewer than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance,
29 but shall instead be assigned to the secondary table of the school district
30 in which they are attending the alternative school, unless the alternative
31 school in question serves students from multiple districts reporting fewer
32 than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance. The
33 tables for exceptional education and alternative school support units shall
34 be applicable only for programs approved by the state department of educa-
35 tion following rules established by the state board of education. Moneys
36 generated from computation of support units for alternative schools shall be
37 utilized for alternative school programs. School district administrative
38 and facility costs may be included as part of the alternative school expen-
39 ditures.
40 (5) State Distribution Factor per Support Unit. Divide educational
41 support program distribution funds, after subtracting the amounts necessary
42 to pay the obligations specified in subsection (2) of this section, by the
11
1 total state support units to secure the state distribution factor per sup-
2 port unit.
3 (6) (5) District Support Units. The number of support units for each
4 school district in the state shall be determined as follows:
5 (a)(i) Divide the actual average daily attendance, excluding stu-
6 dents approved for inclusion in the exceptional child educational
7 program for the administrative schools and each of the separate
8 schools and attendance units, by the appropriate divisor from the
9 tables of support units in this section, then add the quotients
10 to obtain the district's support units allowance for regular stu-
11 dents, kindergarten through grade 12 including alternative school
12 students. Calculations in application of this subsection shall be
13 carried out to the nearest hundredth.
14 (ii) Divide the combined totals of the average daily attendance
15 of all preschool, kindergarten, elementary, secondary, juvenile
16 detention center students and students with disabilities approved
17 for inclusion in the exceptional child program of the district by
18 the appropriate divisor from the table for computation of excep-
19 tional education support units to obtain the number of support
20 units allowed for the district's approved exceptional child pro-
21 gram. Calculations for this subsection shall be carried out to the
22 nearest hundredth when more than one (1) unit is allowed.
23 (iii) The total number of support units of the district shall be
24 the sum of the total support units for regular students, subpara-
25 graph (i) of this paragraph, and the support units allowance for
26 the approved exceptional child program, subparagraph (ii) of this
27 paragraph.
28 (b) Total District Allowance Educational Program. Multiply the dis-
29 trict's total number of support units average daily attendance as
30 provided in section 33-1003A, Idaho Code, carried out to the near-
31 est hundredth, by the state distribution factor per support unit base
32 amount, with weighted amounts added per student as determined by the
33 weighted per-student funding formula, and to this product add the ap-
34 proved amount of programs of the district provided in subsection (2) of
35 this section to secure the district's total allowance for the educa-
36 tional support program.
37 (c) District Share. The district's share of state apportionment is the
38 amount of the total district allowance, paragraph (b) of this subsec-
39 tion.
40 (d) Adjustment of District Share. The contract salary of every noncer-
41 tificated teacher shall be subtracted from the district's share as cal-
42 culated from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this subsection.
43 (7) (6) Property Tax Computation Ratio. In order to receive state funds
44 pursuant to this section, a charter district shall utilize a school mainte-
45 nance and operation property tax computation ratio for the purpose of calcu-
46 lating its maintenance and operation levy that is no greater than that which
47 it utilized in tax year 1994, less four-tenths of one percent (.4%). As used
48 herein, the term "property tax computation ratio" shall mean a ratio deter-
49 mined by dividing the district's certified property tax maintenance and op-
50 eration budget by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment pur-
12
1 poses as such values existed on December 31, 1993. Such maintenance and op-
2 eration levy shall be based on the property tax computation ratio multiplied
3 by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment purposes as such values
4 existed on December 31 of the prior calendar year.
5 SECTION 3. That Section 33-1004, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
6 amended to read as follows:
7 33-1004. STAFF ALLOWANCE. For each school district, a staff allowance
8 shall be determined as follows:
9 (1) Using the daily attendance reports that have been submitted for
10 computing the February 15 apportionment of state funds as provided in sec-
11 tion 33-1009, Idaho Code, calculate the total support units for the district
12 in the manner provided in section 33-1002(6)(a)(5)(a), Idaho Code. If the
13 support units used to calculate discretionary funding pursuant to sections
14 33-1009 and 33-1018, Idaho Code, are at least three percent (3%) greater,
15 seventy-five percent (75%) of the difference shall be added to the support
16 units used for the February 15 apportionment of state funds;
17 (2) Determine the instructional staff allowance by multiplying the
18 support units by 1.021. A district must demonstrate that it actually employs
19 the number of certificated instructional staff allowed, except as provided
20 in subsection (6)(f) and (g) of this section. If the district does not employ
21 the number allowed, the staff allowance shall be reduced to the actual number
22 employed, except as provided in subsection (6)(f) and (g) of this section;
23 (3) Determine the pupil service staff allowance by multiplying the sup-
24 port units by 0.079;
25 (4) Determine the administrative staff allowance by multiplying the
26 support units by .075;
27 (5) Determine the classified staff allowance by multiplying the sup-
28 port units by .375;
29 (6) Additional conditions governing staff allowance:
30 (a) In determining the number of staff in subsections (2), (3), (4) and
31 (5) of this section, a district may contract separately for services to
32 be rendered by nondistrict employees and such employees may be counted
33 in the staff allowance. A "nondistrict employee" means a person for
34 whom the school district does not pay the employer's obligations for
35 employee benefits. When a district contracts for the services of a
36 nondistrict employee, only the salary portion of the contract shall be
37 allowable for computations.
38 (b) If there are circumstances preventing eligible use of staff al-
39 lowance to which a district is entitled as provided in subsections (2),
40 (3) and (4) of this section, an appeal may be filed with the state de-
41 partment of education outlining the reasons and proposed alternative
42 use of these funds, and a waiver may be granted.
43 (c) For any district with less than forty (40) support units:
44 (i) The instructional staff allowance shall be calculated
45 applying the actual number of support units. If the actual in-
46 structional staff employed in the school year is greater than the
47 instructional staff allowance, then the instructional staff al-
48 lowance shall be increased by one-half (1/2) staff allowance; and
13
1 (ii) The administrative staff allowance shall be calculated ap-
2 plying the actual number of support units. If the actual adminis-
3 trative staff employed in the school year is greater than the ad-
4 ministrative staff allowance, then the administrative staff al-
5 lowance shall be increased by one-half (1/2) staff allowance.
6 (iii) Additionally, for any district with less than twenty (20)
7 support units, the instructional staff allowance shall be calcu-
8 lated applying the actual number of support units. If the number
9 of instructional staff employed in the school year is greater than
10 the instructional staff allowance, the staff allowance shall be
11 increased as provided in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this para-
12 graph, and by an additional one-half (1/2) instructional staff al-
13 lowance.
14 (d) For any school district with one (1) or more separate secondary
15 schools serving grades 9 through 12, the instructional staff allowance
16 shall be increased by two (2) additional instructional staff allowances
17 for each such separate secondary school.
18 (e) Only instructional, pupil service and administrative staff and
19 classified personnel compensated by the school district from the gen-
20 eral maintenance and operation fund of the district shall be included in
21 the calculation of staff allowance or in any other calculations based
22 upon staff, including determination of the experience and education
23 multiplier, the reporting requirements, or the district's salary-based
24 apportionment calculation. No food service staff or transportation
25 staff shall be included in the staff allowance.
26 (f) A district may utilize up to fifteen percent (15%) of the moneys
27 associated with positions funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this
28 section to pay another school district or public charter school for
29 instructional services or to defray the cost of providing virtual edu-
30 cation coursework, including virtual dual credit coursework, without a
31 reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed.
32 (g) A district may employ nine and one-half percent (9.5%) fewer posi-
33 tions than funded pursuant to subsections (2) and (3) of this section,
34 without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed.
35 Beginning in fiscal year 2016, this figure shall be reduced by one per-
36 cent (1%) each year for each school district in which the average class
37 size, as determined from prior fiscal year data reported to the state
38 department of education, was at least one (1) student greater than the
39 statewide average class size. The state department of education shall
40 report to the legislature every February, beginning in 2015, on the re-
41 ductions scheduled to take place in this figure, by school district, in
42 the ensuing fiscal year.
43 (i) In the determination of statewide average class size, the
44 state department of education shall not use a single figure de-
45 veloped through the averaging of all districts of varying size,
46 geographical location and pupil populations throughout the state.
47 The statewide average class size shall be comprised of multiple
48 figures determined through analysis of like and similarly sit-
49 uated districts and use of the divisor breakdown established in
50 section 33-1002, Idaho Code.
14
1 (ii) The state board of education may promulgate rules outlining
2 the method of calculation of the statewide average class size fig-
3 ures.
4 (iii) The one percent (1%) reduction required in paragraph (g) of
5 this subsection shall not be applicable for any school year subse-
6 quent to a year when the school district's boundaries have changed
7 because of division, consolidation, excision or annexation of
8 territory.
9 (7) In the event that the staff allowance in any category is insuffi-
10 cient to meet accreditation standards, a district may appeal to the state
11 board of education, demonstrating the insufficiency, and the state board may
12 grant a waiver authorizing sufficient additional staff to be included within
13 the staff allowance to meet accreditation standards. Such a waiver shall be
14 limited to one (1) year, but may be renewed upon showing of continuing justi-
15 fication.
16 (8) A district may utilize a portion of the instructional staff al-
17 lowance provided for in this section for kindergarten teachers to visit the
18 parents or guardians of students during the first week of the kindergarten
19 school year. Such visits may take place at school, at the student's home
20 or at another location agreed to by the teacher and parents or guardians.
21 The purpose of such visits is to help strengthen the working relationship
22 between the teacher, the parents or guardians, and the student. The visits
23 should be used as an opportunity to help establish the teacher's expecta-
24 tions of the student. The visit should also provide an opportunity for the
25 parents or guardians to explain their expectations. The amount of moneys to
26 be expended for such visits by the district may not exceed the amount equal
27 to one (1) week of instructional staff allowance computed for kindergarten
28 instructors in the district.
29 SECTION 4. That Section 33-1009, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
30 amended to read as follows:
31 33-1009. PAYMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC SCHOOL INCOME FUND.
32 1.a. Payments of the state general account appropriation for public
33 school support shall be made each year by the state department of educa-
34 tion to the public school districts of the state in four (4) payments.
35 Payments to the districts shall be made not later than the fifteenth day
36 of August, the fifteenth day of November, the fifteenth day of February,
37 and the fifteenth day of May each year. The first payment by the state
38 department of education shall be approximately fifty percent (50%) of
39 the total general account appropriation for the fiscal year, while the
40 second and third payments shall be approximately twenty percent (20%)
41 each, and the fourth payment approximately ten percent (10%) respec-
42 tively, except as provided for in section 33-5207, Idaho Code. Amounts
43 apportioned due to a special transfer to the public school income fund
44 to restore or reduce a deficiency in the prior year's transfer pursuant
45 to subsection 4. of this section shall not be subject to this limita-
46 tion.
47 b. Payments of moneys, other than the state general account appropria-
48 tion, that accrue to the public school income fund shall be made by the
49 state department of education to the school districts of the state on
15
1 the fifteenth day of November, February, May and July each year. The
2 total amount of such payments shall be determined by the state depart-
3 ment of education and shall not exceed the amount of moneys available
4 and on deposit in the public school income fund at the time such payment
5 is made.
6 c. Amounts apportioned due to a special transfer to the public school
7 income fund to restore or reduce a deficiency in the prior year's trans-
8 fer pursuant to subsection 4. of this section shall not be subject to
9 the limitation imposed by paragraphs a. and b. of this subsection.
10 2. Payments made to the school districts in August and November are ad-
11 vance payments for the current year and may be based upon payments from the
12 public school income fund for the preceding school year. Each school dis-
13 trict may receive its proportionate share of the advance payments in the same
14 ratio that its total payment for the preceding year was to the total payments
15 to all school districts for the preceding year.
16 3. No later than the fifteenth day of February in each year, the
17 state department of education shall compute the state distribution factor
18 weighted per-student funding based on the total average daily attendance
19 through the first Friday in November. The factor weighted per-student fund-
20 ing will be used in payments of state funds in February and May. Attendance
21 shall be reported in a format and at a time specified by the state department
22 of education.
23 As of the thirtieth day of June of each year the state department of edu-
24 cation shall determine final payments to be made on July fifteenth next suc-
25 ceeding to the several school districts from the public school income fund
26 for the school year ended June 30. The July payments shall take into consid-
27 eration:
28 a. The average daily attendance of the several school districts for the
29 twenty-eight (28) best weeks of the school year completed not later than
30 the thirtieth of June;
31 b. All funds available in the public school income fund for the fiscal
32 year ending on the thirtieth of June;
33 c. All payments distributed for the current fiscal year to the several
34 school districts;
35 d. The adjustment based on the actual amount of discretionary funds
36 per support unit student required by the provisions of section 33-1018,
37 Idaho Code;
38 e. Payments made or due for the transportation support program and the
39 exceptional education support program. The state department of educa-
40 tion shall apportion and direct the payment to the several school dis-
41 tricts the moneys in the public school income fund in each year, taking
42 into account the advance made under subsection 2. of this section, in
43 such amounts as will provide in full for each district its support pro-
44 gram, and not more than therefor required, and no school district shall
45 receive less than fifty dollars ($50.00).
46 4. If the full amount appropriated to the public school income fund
47 from the general account by the legislature is not transferred to the public
48 school income fund by the end of the fiscal year, the deficiency resulting
49 therefrom shall either be restored or reduced through a special trans-
50 fer from the general account in the first sixty (60) days of the following
16
1 fiscal year, or shall be calculated in computing district levies, and any
2 additional levy shall be certified by the state superintendent of public
3 instruction to the board of county commissioners and added to the district's
4 maintenance and operation levy. If the deficiency is restored or reduced
5 by special transfer, the amount so transferred shall be in addition to the
6 amount appropriated to be transferred in such following fiscal year and
7 shall be apportioned to each school district in the same amount as each would
8 have received had the transfer been made in the year the deficiency occurred.
9 The state department of education shall distribute to the school district
10 the full amount of the special transfer as soon as practical after such
11 transfer is made. In making the levy computations required by this subsec-
12 tion the state department of education shall take into account and consider
13 the full amount of money receipted into the public school income fund from
14 all sources for the given fiscal year. Deficits in the transfer of the ap-
15 propriated amount of general account revenue to the public school income
16 fund shall be reduced by the amount, if any, that the total amount receipted
17 from other sources into the public school income fund exceeds the official
18 estimated amount from those sources. The official estimate of receipts from
19 other sources shall be the total amount stated by the legislature in the ap-
20 propriation bill. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any
21 transfers to or from the public education stabilization fund.
22 5. Any apportionments in any year, made to any school district, which
23 may within the succeeding three (3) year period be found to have been in error
24 either of computation or transmittal, may be corrected during the three (3)
25 year period by reduction of apportionments to any school district to which
26 over-apportionments may have been made or received, and corresponding ad-
27 ditions to apportionments to any school district to which under-apportion-
28 ments may have been made or received.
29 SECTION 5. That Section 33-1018, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
30 amended to read as follows:
31 33-1018. PUBLIC SCHOOL DISCRETIONARY FUNDING VARIABILITY. (1) The
32 state department of education shall calculate the weighted per-student
33 funding formula as defined in section 33-1001, Idaho Code, to allocate ed-
34 ucational support program funding to school districts and public charter
35 schools. The state department of education shall utilize the information
36 reported on weighted student characteristics as defined in section 33-1001,
37 Idaho Code, from local education agencies pursuant to sections 33-1027 and
38 33-1028, Idaho Code.
39 (2) In fiscal years 2026 and 2027, if the allocation of general discre-
40 tionary funds and state educational support distributions shifted to gen-
41 eral discretionary funds in the current year for a school district or public
42 charter school is less than one hundred percent (100%) of what the alloca-
43 tion would have been if the allocation was based on support units, then an ad-
44 ditional allocation shall be made to that school district or public charter
45 school.
46 (3) The legislature shall annually state in the appropriation for the
47 educational support program/division of operations the estimate of the to-
48 tal discretionary the base funding provided per support unit student as de-
49 termined by the weighted per-student funding formula. The state department
17
1 of education shall, before the end of each fiscal year, calculate the actual
2 discretionary funding available per support unit student as determined by
3 the weighted per-student funding formula.
4 (1) (4) If the total estimated discretionary funding per support unit
5 student as determined by the weighted per-student funding formula stated in
6 the appropriation for the educational support program/division of opera-
7 tions is lower than the actual discretionary funding available per support
8 unit student as determined by the weighted per-student funding formula, then
9 the state controller shall multiply the difference by the number of actual
10 support units, and transfer the result from the public school income fund
11 to the public education stabilization fund and the final distributions to
12 school districts from the department of education shall be reduced by a like
13 amount.
14 (2) (5) If the total estimated discretionary funding per support unit
15 student as determined by the weighted per-student funding formula stated in
16 the appropriation for the educational support program/division of opera-
17 tions is greater than the actual discretionary funding available per support
18 unit student as determined by the weighted per-student funding formula, then
19 the state controller shall multiply the difference by the number of actual
20 support units, and transfer the result from the public education stabiliza-
21 tion fund to the public school income fund. This transfer shall be limited to
22 moneys available in the public education stabilization fund. Moneys trans-
23 ferred from the public education stabilization fund to the public school
24 income fund under the provisions of this section are hereby continuously
25 appropriated for the educational support program/division of operations.
26 SECTION 6. That Section 33-1614, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
27 amended to read as follows:
28 33-1614. CAREER EXPLORATION. (1) Starting in fiscal year 2024, every
29 student in grade 7 or grade 8 enrolled in an Idaho public school district,
30 a specially chartered district, or a public charter school shall complete
31 one (1) or more career exploration courses. A student may opt out by sub-
32 mitting a form to the school showing the student's parent or legal guardian
33 has consented to the student not participating in the career exploration
34 courses pursuant to this section. Such courses should align to the "first
35 step" standards set by the state board of education for career technical edu-
36 cation. Such courses may be offered face-to-face, through virtual education
37 programs, as online courses, or as hybrid courses consisting of a combina-
38 tion of online and in-person instruction.
39 (2) All staff teaching a career exploration course must have partici-
40 pated in a career exploration professional development course approved by
41 the state board of education.
42 (3) The state board of education will maintain resources that can be
43 utilized or modified for the implementation of this section.
44 (4) A career pathway plan shall be developed by students with the ap-
45 proval of parents or guardians, with advice and recommendation from school
46 personnel, which shall include career exploration courses or workforce dis-
47 covery activities. The purpose of a parent-approved student career pathway
48 plan is to outline a course of study and learning activities to help students
49 become successful in life. Every student's career pathway plan shall be re-
18
1 viewed annually and can be revised at any time. The student's school shall
2 provide a personalized career pathway plan progress report to the student's
3 parent or guardian. The progress report may be sent via electronic communi-
4 cation.
5 (5) Funding provided in section 33-1002(2)(r)(q), Idaho Code, in ac-
6 cordance with section 33-1212A, Idaho Code, may be used to support career ex-
7 ploration courses.
8 (6) Professional development funding provided pursuant to section
9 33-1002, Idaho Code, may be used to provide professional development to ca-
10 reer exploration course instructors.
11 SECTION 7. That Section 33-1632, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
12 amended to read as follows:
13 33-1632. MASTERY-BASED EDUCATION. (1) The legislature finds that mov-
14 ing toward mastery-based education where students progress as they demon-
15 strate mastery of a subject or grade level is in the best interest of Idaho
16 students. The legislature further finds that moving from the current time-
17 based system to a mastery-based approach will allow for more personalized
18 and differentiated learning; create a focus on explicit, measurable, trans-
19 ferable learning objectives that empower students; and emphasize competen-
20 cies that include application and knowledge along with skill development.
21 (2) The state department of education shall perform the following ac-
22 tivities to move Idaho toward mastery-based education:
23 (a) Provide ongoing statewide outreach and communications to increase
24 awareness and understanding of and promote interest in mastery-based
25 education for teachers, administrators, parents, students, business
26 leaders, and policymakers;
27 (b) Facilitate and maintain the Idaho mastery education network
28 composed of Idaho public school districts and charter schools that col-
29 laborate to transition Idaho to mastery-based education. The network
30 shall:
31 (i) Advise the superintendent of public instruction and the state
32 board of education on the progress of the transition to mastery-
33 based education;
34 (ii) Develop evidence-based recommendations for continued imple-
35 mentation;
36 (iii) Implement the policies of the legislature and the state
37 board of education for the transition to mastery-based education;
38 and
39 (iv) Provide network resources, including professional develop-
40 ment, coaching, and best practices, to Idaho public school dis-
41 tricts and charter schools; and
42 (c) Create a sustainability plan for statewide scaling of mas-
43 tery-based education and ensure that all public school districts and
44 charter schools participating in the Idaho mastery education network
45 develop plans that describe how the public school district or charter
46 school will maintain a mastery-based approach to education. Plans must
47 include a process to develop the rubrics and assessments necessary to
48 determine mastery and award credit.
19
1 (3) The state department of education may expend or distribute moneys
2 appropriated for purposes identified in subsection (2) of this section di-
3 rectly to public school districts and charter schools that are participating
4 in the mastery education network and have applied and been selected to re-
5 ceive mastery-based education grants. The cost of activities provided for
6 in this section shall be paid by the state department of education from mon-
7 eys appropriated for this program in the educational support program budget
8 as provided for in section 33-1002, Idaho Code.
9 (4) Any public school district or charter school may participate in the
10 mastery education network by applying to the state department of education,
11 even if such district or school is not selected to receive mastery-based edu-
12 cation grants.
13 (5) No later than January 31 of each year, the state department of edu-
14 cation shall report annually to the state board of education and the educa-
15 tion committees of the senate and the house of representatives regarding the
16 progress toward implementing mastery-based education.
17 (6) For purposes of this section:
18 (a) "Mastery-based education " means an education system where student
19 progress is based on a student's demonstration of mastery of competen-
20 cies and content, not seat time or the age or grade level of the student.
21 (b) "Network" means the Idaho mastery education network.
22 SECTION 8. That Section 33-5207, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
23 amended to read as follows:
24 33-5207. PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL FINANCIAL SUPPORT. (1) Except as oth-
25 erwise provided for in this section, the state department of education shall
26 make the following apportionment to each charter school for each fiscal year
27 based on attendance figures submitted in a manner and time as required by the
28 state department of education.
29 (2) Per student support. Computation of support units for each public
30 charter school shall be calculated as if it were a separate school accord-
31 ing to the schedules in section 33-1002(4), Idaho Code, except that public
32 charter schools with fewer than one hundred (100) secondary ADA shall use a
33 divisor of twelve (12) and the minimum units shall not apply. No public char-
34 ter school shall receive an increase in support units that exceeds the sup-
35 port units it received in the prior year by more than forty (40), except in
36 cases of state declared emergencies that have been approved by the autho-
37 rizer as having an impact on public education. Funding from the state ed-
38 ucational support program shall be equal to the total distribution factor
39 weighted per-student funding, plus the salary-based apportionment provided
40 in chapter 10, title 33, Idaho Code. Provided, however, any public char-
41 ter school that is formed by the conversion of an existing traditional public
42 school shall be assigned divisors, pursuant to section 33-1002, Idaho Code,
43 that are no lower than the divisors of the school district in which the tradi-
44 tional public school is located, for each category of pupils listed.
45 (3) Special education. For each student enrolled in the public char-
46 ter school who is entitled to special education services, the public charter
47 school shall receive the state and federal funds from the exceptional child
48 education program for that student that would have been apportioned to the
49 school district in which the public charter school is located.
20
1 (4) Alternative school support. Public charter schools may qualify
2 under the provisions of sections 33-1002 and 33-1002C, Idaho Code, provided
3 the public charter school meets the necessary statutory requirements and
4 students qualify for attendance at an alternative school as provided by rule
5 of the state board of education.
6 (5) Transportation support. Support shall be paid to the public char-
7 ter school as provided in chapter 15, title 33, Idaho Code, and section
8 33-1006, Idaho Code. Each public charter school shall furnish the depart-
9 ment with an enrollment count as of the first Friday in November of public
10 charter school students who are eligible for reimbursement of transporta-
11 tion costs under the provisions of this subsection and who reside more than
12 one and one-half (1 1/2) miles from the school. The state department of edu-
13 cation is authorized to include in the annual appropriation to the charter
14 school sixty percent (60%) of the estimated transportation cost. The final
15 appropriation payment in July shall reflect reimbursements of actual costs
16 pursuant to section 33-1006, Idaho Code. To be eligible for state reimburse-
17 ment under the provisions of section 33-1006, Idaho Code, the student to be
18 transported must reside within the public charter school's primary atten-
19 dance area and must meet at least one (1) of the following criteria:
20 (a) The student resides within the school district in which the public
21 charter school is physically located; or
22 (b) The student resides within fifteen (15) miles by road of the public
23 charter school. The limitations placed by this subsection on the reim-
24 bursement of transportation costs for certain students shall not apply
25 to public virtual schools.
26 (6) Facilities funds.
27 (a) The state department of education shall distribute facilities
28 funds to public charter schools for each student in which a majority
29 of the student's instruction is received at a physical facility that
30 is owned or leased by the public charter school. Such funds shall be
31 used to defray the costs associated with payments for real property used
32 by the students or employees of the public charter school for educa-
33 tional or administrative purposes. Such funds shall be distributed at
34 four hundred dollars ($400) per attending student pursuant to section
35 33-1003A, Idaho Code. For the purposes of this paragraph, beginning in
36 state fiscal year 2025, "attending student" means each student in aver-
37 age daily attendance in kindergarten through grade 12 at such physical
38 charter school facilities where the student is enrolled; except that,
39 upon formal approval by the state board of education, a charter school
40 may receive an exemption to the physical facility requirement pursuant
41 to the provisions of this paragraph if the student would have attended a
42 physical facility if not for a stated emergency.
43 (b) For those public charter schools that do not receive facilities
44 funds for all enrolled students, the school may submit to the state
45 department of education a reimbursement claim for any costs for which
46 facilities funds may be used. The state department of education shall
47 reduce such claim by the greater of fifty percent (50%) or the percent-
48 age of the school's enrolled students for which the school receives
49 facilities funds and shall pay the balance. Provided, however, that the
50 total reimbursements paid to a public charter school, in combination
21
1 with any facilities stipend received by the school, shall not exceed the
2 amount of facilities funds that would have been received by the school
3 had the school received facilities funds for all students in average
4 daily attendance pursuant to section 33-1003A, Idaho Code. For the
5 purposes of this subsection, the term "real property" shall be used as
6 defined in section 63-201, Idaho Code. A virtual public charter school
7 authorized by the public charter school commission or authorized by a
8 public school district on or after March 1, 2024, shall not be eligible
9 for funds appropriated pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
10 (7) Payment schedule. The state department of education is authorized
11 to make an advance payment of twenty-five percent (25%) of a public charter
12 school's estimated annual apportionment for its first year of operation,
13 and each year thereafter, provided the public charter school is serving more
14 grades or at least ten percent (10%) more classes than the previous year, to
15 assist the school with initial start-up costs or payroll obligations. For
16 a public charter school entering at least its second year of operation, the
17 state department of education may require documentation establishing the
18 need for such an advance payment, including comparative class schedules and
19 proof of a commensurate increase in the number of employees.
20 (a) For a public charter school to receive the advance payment, the
21 school shall submit its anticipated fall membership for each grade
22 level to the state department of education by June 1.
23 (b) Using the figures provided by the public charter school, the state
24 department of education shall determine an estimated annual apportion-
25 ment from which the amount of the advance payment shall be calculated.
26 Advance payment shall be made to the school on or after July 1 but no
27 later than July 31.
28 (c) All subsequent payments, taking into account the onetime advance
29 payment made for the first year of operation, shall be made to the public
30 charter school in the same manner as other traditional public schools in
31 accordance with the provisions of section 33-1009, Idaho Code. A public
32 charter school shall comply with all applicable fiscal requirements of
33 law, except that the following provisions shall not be applicable to
34 public charter schools: that portion of section 33-1004, Idaho Code,
35 relating to reduction of the administrative and instructional staff
36 allowance and the pupil service staff allowance when there is a dis-
37 crepancy between the number allowed and the number actually employed;
38 and section 33-1004E, Idaho Code, for calculation of district staff
39 indices.
40 (8) If an authorizer has reason to believe that a public charter school
41 cannot remain fiscally sound for the remainder of its certificate term, it
42 shall provide the state department of education with written notification of
43 such concern. Upon receiving such notification, the state department of ed-
44 ucation shall have the authority to modify the percentage of the total appro-
45 priation to be paid to the public charter school pursuant to the provisions
46 of section 33-1009 1., Idaho Code, such that equal percentages are paid on
47 each of the prescribed dates.
48 (9) Each public charter school shall pay an authorizer fee to its au-
49 thorizer, not to initially exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), or, in
50 the case of existing charter schools, up to a five-percent (5%) increase of
22
1 the previous year's fee. Authorizers shall annually set the authorizer's
2 fee and in doing so shall document the fees to actual expenditures associated
3 with authorizing.
4 (10) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a public charter school from:
5 (a) Applying for federal grant moneys or for career technical education
6 funding of any source; or
7 (b) Receiving funding or other financial assistance for the establish-
8 ment or operation of a public charter school from any private person or
9 organization.
10 (11) Each student in attendance at a public virtual school shall be
11 funded based on either the actual hours of attendance in the public virtual
12 school on a flexible schedule or the percentage of coursework completed,
13 whichever is more advantageous to the school, up to the maximum of one (1)
14 full-time equivalent student.
15 (12) All federal educational funds shall be administered and dis-
16 tributed to public charter schools, including public virtual schools, that
17 have been designated as a local education agency (LEA), as provided in sec-
18 tion 33-5203, Idaho Code.
19 (13) Nothing in this section prohibits separate face-to-face learning
20 activities or services. In order to be eligible for career technical educa-
21 tion essential components funding, virtual schools may be required to offer
22 some face-to-face instruction in order to meet industry standards, licens-
23 ing requirements, work-based learning requirements, or other requirements
24 set forth by law.
25 (14) The provisions of section 33-1021, Idaho Code, shall apply to pub-
26 lic charter schools provided for in this chapter.
27 SECTION 9. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
28 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
29 July 1, 2025.

15 average of the three (3) highest student counts for verified students
16 reported pursuant to section 33-1027, Idaho Code. The weighted amounts
17 shall be as follows:
18 (i) For economically disadvantaged students, the base amount per
19 student multiplied by one quarter (.25);
20 (ii) For English language learners, the base amount per student
21 multiplied by one quarter (.25);
22 (iii) For special education students, the base amount per student
23 multiplied by one and three quarters (1.75);
24 (iv) For students attending a school district or public charter
25 school with less than one thousand two hundred (1,200) average
26 daily attendance, except for students in a virtual program, one
27 (1) minus the result of the average daily attendance for that
28 school district or public charter school multiplied by the result
29 of one (1) divided by one thousand two hundred (1,200), the result
30 of which shall be multiplied by the base amount per student;
31 (v) For gifted and talented students, the base amount per student
32 multiplied by one quarter (.25); and
33 (vi) For at-risk students attending an alternative school, the
34 base amount per student multiplied by one (1).
35 (b) Funding for each characteristic may be combined if a student has
36 more than one (1) of the weighted student characteristics. Any school
37 district or public charter school that has at least one (1) student but
38 fewer than five (5) students who meet the criteria for any characteris-
39 tic provided for in paragraph (a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), or (vi)
40 of this subsection shall receive funding as if it has five (5) such stu-
41 dents.
42 (36) "Weighted student characteristic" means a characteristic of a
43 student that is associated with measurable student achievement and educa-
44 tional need, including a student's status as economically disadvantaged, an
45 English language learner, requiring special education, attending a school
46 district or public charter school with less than six hundred (600) average
47 daily attendance, gifted and talented, or at-risk and attending an alterna-
48 tive school.
49 SECTION 2. That Section 33-1002, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
50 amended to read as follows:

22 students in kindergarten through grade 3 will receive a minimum of
23 two thousand dollars ($2,000). Economically disadvantaged stu-
24 dents shall count as one and three quarters (1.75) students for the
25 purpose of calculating the distribution of the funds in subpara-
26 graph (ii) of this paragraph.
27 (s) For mastery-based education as provided for in section 33-1632,

36 shall be the sum of the average daily attendance of all of the school dis-
37 tricts of the state. The state board of education shall establish rules set-
38 ting forth the procedure to determine average daily attendance and the time
39 for, and method of, submission of such report. Average daily attendance cal-
40 culation shall be carried out to the nearest hundredth. Computation of av-
41 erage daily attendance shall also be governed by the provisions of section
42 33-1003A, Idaho Code.
43 (4) Support Units. The total state support units shall be determined
44 by using the tables set out hereafter called computation of kindergarten
45 support units, computation of elementary support units, computation of sec-
46 ondary support units, computation of exceptional education support units,
47 and computation of alternative school support units. The sum of all of the
48 total support units of all school districts of the state shall be the total
49 state support units.

19 In applying these tables to any given separate attendance unit, no
20 school district shall receive less total money than it would receive if it
21 had a lesser average daily attendance in such separate attendance unit. In
22 applying the kindergarten table to a kindergarten program of fewer days
23 than a full school year, the support unit allowance shall be in ratio to the
24 number of days of a full school year. The attendance of students attending
25 an alternative school in a school district reporting fewer than one hundred
26 (100) secondary students in average daily attendance shall not be assigned
27 to the alternative table if the student is from a school district reporting
28 fewer than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance,
29 but shall instead be assigned to the secondary table of the school district
30 in which they are attending the alternative school, unless the alternative
31 school in question serves students from multiple districts reporting fewer
32 than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance. The
33 tables for exceptional education and alternative school support units shall
34 be applicable only for programs approved by the state department of educa-
35 tion following rules established by the state board of education. Moneys
36 generated from computation of support units for alternative schools shall be
37 utilized for alternative school programs. School district administrative
38 and facility costs may be included as part of the alternative school expen-
39 ditures.
40 (5) State Distribution Factor per Support Unit. Divide educational
41 support program distribution funds, after subtracting the amounts necessary
42 to pay the obligations specified in subsection (2) of this section, by the

11
1 total state support units to secure the state distribution factor per sup-
2 port unit.
3 (6) (5) District Support Units. The number of support units for each
4 school district in the state shall be determined as follows:
5 (a)(i) Divide the actual average daily attendance, excluding stu-
6 dents approved for inclusion in the exceptional child educational
7 program for the administrative schools and each of the separate
8 schools and attendance units, by the appropriate divisor from the
9 tables of support units in this section, then add the quotients
10 to obtain the district's support units allowance for regular stu-
11 dents, kindergarten through grade 12 including alternative school
12 students. Calculations in application of this subsection shall be
13 carried out to the nearest hundredth.
14 (ii) Divide the combined totals of the average daily attendance
15 of all preschool, kindergarten, elementary, secondary, juvenile
16 detention center students and students with disabilities approved
17 for inclusion in the exceptional child program of the district by
18 the appropriate divisor from the table for computation of excep-
19 tional education support units to obtain the number of support
20 units allowed for the district's approved exceptional child pro-
21 gram. Calculations for this subsection shall be carried out to the
22 nearest hundredth when more than one (1) unit is allowed.
23 (iii) The total number of support units of the district shall be
24 the sum of the total support units for regular students, subpara-
25 graph (i) of this paragraph, and the support units allowance for
26 the approved exceptional child program, subparagraph (ii) of this
27 paragraph.
28 (b) Total District Allowance Educational Program. Multiply the dis-
29 trict's total number of support units average daily attendance as
30 provided in section 33-1003A, Idaho Code, carried out to the near-
31 est hundredth, by the state distribution factor per support unit base
32 amount, with weighted amounts added per student as determined by the
33 weighted per-student funding formula, and to this product add the ap-
34 proved amount of programs of the district provided in subsection (2) of
35 this section to secure the district's total allowance for the educa-
36 tional support program.
37 (c) District Share. The district's share of state apportionment is the
38 amount of the total district allowance, paragraph (b) of this subsec-
39 tion.
40 (d) Adjustment of District Share. The contract salary of every noncer-
41 tificated teacher shall be subtracted from the district's share as cal-
42 culated from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this subsection.
43 (7) (6) Property Tax Computation Ratio. In order to receive state funds
44 pursuant to this section, a charter district shall utilize a school mainte-
45 nance and operation property tax computation ratio for the purpose of calcu-
46 lating its maintenance and operation levy that is no greater than that which
47 it utilized in tax year 1994, less four-tenths of one percent (.4%). As used
48 herein, the term "property tax computation ratio" shall mean a ratio deter-
49 mined by dividing the district's certified property tax maintenance and op-
50 eration budget by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment pur-

12
1 poses as such values existed on December 31, 1993. Such maintenance and op-
2 eration levy shall be based on the property tax computation ratio multiplied
3 by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment purposes as such values
4 existed on December 31 of the prior calendar year.
5 SECTION 3. That Section 33-1004, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
6 amended to read as follows:
7 33-1004. STAFF ALLOWANCE. For each school district, a staff allowance
8 shall be determined as follows:
9 (1) Using the daily attendance reports that have been submitted for
10 computing the February 15 apportionment of state funds as provided in sec-
11 tion 33-1009, Idaho Code, calculate the total support units for the district
12 in the manner provided in section 33-1002(6)(a)(5)(a), Idaho Code. If the
13 support units used to calculate discretionary funding pursuant to sections
14 33-1009 and 33-1018, Idaho Code, are at least three percent (3%) greater,
15 seventy-five percent (75%) of the difference shall be added to the support
16 units used for the February 15 apportionment of state funds;
17 (2) Determine the instructional staff allowance by multiplying the
18 support units by 1.021. A district must demonstrate that it actually employs
19 the number of certificated instructional staff allowed, except as provided
20 in subsection (6)(f) and (g) of this section. If the district does not employ
21 the number allowed, the staff allowance shall be reduced to the actual number
22 employed, except as provided in subsection (6)(f) and (g) of this section;
23 (3) Determine the pupil service staff allowance by multiplying the sup-
24 port units by 0.079;
25 (4) Determine the administrative staff allowance by multiplying the
26 support units by .075;
27 (5) Determine the classified staff allowance by multiplying the sup-
28 port units by .375;
29 (6) Additional conditions governing staff allowance:
30 (a) In determining the number of staff in subsections (2), (3), (4) and
31 (5) of this section, a district may contract separately for services to
32 be rendered by nondistrict employees and such employees may be counted
33 in the staff allowance. A "nondistrict employee" means a person for
34 whom the school district does not pay the employer's obligations for
35 employee benefits. When a district contracts for the services of a
36 nondistrict employee, only the salary portion of the contract shall be
37 allowable for computations.
38 (b) If there are circumstances preventing eligible use of staff al-
39 lowance to which a district is entitled as provided in subsections (2),
40 (3) and (4) of this section, an appeal may be filed with the state de-
41 partment of education outlining the reasons and proposed alternative
42 use of these funds, and a waiver may be granted.
43 (c) For any district with less than forty (40) support units:
44 (i) The instructional staff allowance shall be calculated
45 applying the actual number of support units. If the actual in-
46 structional staff employed in the school year is greater than the
47 instructional staff allowance, then the instructional staff al-
48 lowance shall be increased by one-half (1/2) staff allowance; and

13
1 (ii) The administrative staff allowance shall be calculated ap-
2 plying the actual number of support units. If the actual adminis-
3 trative staff employed in the school year is greater than the ad-
4 ministrative staff allowance, then the administrative staff al-
5 lowance shall be increased by one-half (1/2) staff allowance.
6 (iii) Additionally, for any district with less than twenty (20)
7 support units, the instructional staff allowance shall be calcu-
8 lated applying the actual number of support units. If the number
9 of instructional staff employed in the school year is greater than
10 the instructional staff allowance, the staff allowance shall be
11 increased as provided in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this para-
12 graph, and by an additional one-half (1/2) instructional staff al-
13 lowance.
14 (d) For any school district with one (1) or more separate secondary
15 schools serving grades 9 through 12, the instructional staff allowance
16 shall be increased by two (2) additional instructional staff allowances
17 for each such separate secondary school.
18 (e) Only instructional, pupil service and administrative staff and
19 classified personnel compensated by the school district from the gen-
20 eral maintenance and operation fund of the district shall be included in
21 the calculation of staff allowance or in any other calculations based
22 upon staff, including determination of the experience and education
23 multiplier, the reporting requirements, or the district's salary-based
24 apportionment calculation. No food service staff or transportation
25 staff shall be included in the staff allowance.
26 (f) A district may utilize up to fifteen percent (15%) of the moneys
27 associated with positions funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this
28 section to pay another school district or public charter school for
29 instructional services or to defray the cost of providing virtual edu-
30 cation coursework, including virtual dual credit coursework, without a
31 reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed.
32 (g) A district may employ nine and one-half percent (9.5%) fewer posi-
33 tions than funded pursuant to subsections (2) and (3) of this section,
34 without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed.
35 Beginning in fiscal year 2016, this figure shall be reduced by one per-
36 cent (1%) each year for each school district in which the average class
37 size, as determined from prior fiscal year data reported to the state
38 department of education, was at least one (1) student greater than the
39 statewide average class size. The state department of education shall
40 report to the legislature every February, beginning in 2015, on the re-
41 ductions scheduled to take place in this figure, by school district, in
42 the ensuing fiscal year.
43 (i) In the determination of statewide average class size, the
44 state department of education shall not use a single figure de-
45 veloped through the averaging of all districts of varying size,
46 geographical location and pupil populations throughout the state.
47 The statewide average class size shall be comprised of multiple
48 figures determined through analysis of like and similarly sit-
49 uated districts and use of the divisor breakdown established in
50 section 33-1002, Idaho Code.

14
1 (ii) The state board of education may promulgate rules outlining
2 the method of calculation of the statewide average class size fig-
3 ures.
4 (iii) The one percent (1%) reduction required in paragraph (g) of
5 this subsection shall not be applicable for any school year subse-
6 quent to a year when the school district's boundaries have changed
7 because of division, consolidation, excision or annexation of
8 territory.
9 (7) In the event that the staff allowance in any category is insuffi-
10 cient to meet accreditation standards, a district may appeal to the state
11 board of education, demonstrating the insufficiency, and the state board may
12 grant a waiver authorizing sufficient additional staff to be included within
13 the staff allowance to meet accreditation standards. Such a waiver shall be
14 limited to one (1) year, but may be renewed upon showing of continuing justi-
15 fication.
16 (8) A district may utilize a portion of the instructional staff al-
17 lowance provided for in this section for kindergarten teachers to visit the
18 parents or guardians of students during the first week of the kindergarten
19 school year. Such visits may take place at school, at the student's home
20 or at another location agreed to by the teacher and parents or guardians.
21 The purpose of such visits is to help strengthen the working relationship
22 between the teacher, the parents or guardians, and the student. The visits
23 should be used as an opportunity to help establish the teacher's expecta-
24 tions of the student. The visit should also provide an opportunity for the
25 parents or guardians to explain their expectations. The amount of moneys to
26 be expended for such visits by the district may not exceed the amount equal
27 to one (1) week of instructional staff allowance computed for kindergarten
28 instructors in the district.
29 SECTION 4. That Section 33-1009, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
30 amended to read as follows:
31 33-1009. PAYMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC SCHOOL INCOME FUND.
32 1.a. Payments of the state general account appropriation for public
33 school support shall be made each year by the state department of educa-
34 tion to the public school districts of the state in four (4) payments.
35 Payments to the districts shall be made not later than the fifteenth day
36 of August, the fifteenth day of November, the fifteenth day of February,
37 and the fifteenth day of May each year. The first payment by the state
38 department of education shall be approximately fifty percent (50%) of
39 the total general account appropriation for the fiscal year, while the
40 second and third payments shall be approximately twenty percent (20%)
41 each, and the fourth payment approximately ten percent (10%) respec-
42 tively, except as provided for in section 33-5207, Idaho Code. Amounts
43 apportioned due to a special transfer to the public school income fund
44 to restore or reduce a deficiency in the prior year's transfer pursuant
45 to subsection 4. of this section shall not be subject to this limita-
46 tion.
47 b. Payments of moneys, other than the state general account appropria-
48 tion, that accrue to the public school income fund shall be made by the
49 state department of education to the school districts of the state on

15
1 the fifteenth day of November, February, May and July each year. The
2 total amount of such payments shall be determined by the state depart-
3 ment of education and shall not exceed the amount of moneys available
4 and on deposit in the public school income fund at the time such payment
5 is made.
6 c. Amounts apportioned due to a special transfer to the public school
7 income fund to restore or reduce a deficiency in the prior year's trans-
8 fer pursuant to subsection 4. of this section shall not be subject to
9 the limitation imposed by paragraphs a. and b. of this subsection.
10 2. Payments made to the school districts in August and November are ad-
11 vance payments for the current year and may be based upon payments from the
12 public school income fund for the preceding school year. Each school dis-
13 trict may receive its proportionate share of the advance payments in the same
14 ratio that its total payment for the preceding year was to the total payments
15 to all school districts for the preceding year.
16 3. No later than the fifteenth day of February in each year, the
17 state department of education shall compute the state distribution factor
18 weighted per-student funding based on the total average daily attendance
19 through the first Friday in November. The factor weighted per-student fund-
20 ing will be used in payments of state funds in February and May. Attendance
21 shall be reported in a format and at a time specified by the state department
22 of education.
23 As of the thirtieth day of June of each year the state department of edu-
24 cation shall determine final payments to be made on July fifteenth next suc-
25 ceeding to the several school districts from the public school income fund
26 for the school year ended June 30. The July payments shall take into consid-
27 eration:
28 a. The average daily attendance of the several school districts for the
29 twenty-eight (28) best weeks of the school year completed not later than
30 the thirtieth of June;
31 b. All funds available in the public school income fund for the fiscal
32 year ending on the thirtieth of June;
33 c. All payments distributed for the current fiscal year to the several
34 school districts;
35 d. The adjustment based on the actual amount of discretionary funds
36 per support unit student required by the provisions of section 33-1018,
37 Idaho Code;
38 e. Payments made or due for the transportation support program and the
39 exceptional education support program. The state department of educa-
40 tion shall apportion and direct the payment to the several school dis-
41 tricts the moneys in the public school income fund in each year, taking
42 into account the advance made under subsection 2. of this section, in
43 such amounts as will provide in full for each district its support pro-
44 gram, and not more than therefor required, and no school district shall
45 receive less than fifty dollars ($50.00).
46 4. If the full amount appropriated to the public school income fund
47 from the general account by the legislature is not transferred to the public
48 school income fund by the end of the fiscal year, the deficiency resulting
49 therefrom shall either be restored or reduced through a special trans-
50 fer from the general account in the first sixty (60) days of the following

16
1 fiscal year, or shall be calculated in computing district levies, and any
2 additional levy shall be certified by the state superintendent of public
3 instruction to the board of county commissioners and added to the district's
4 maintenance and operation levy. If the deficiency is restored or reduced
5 by special transfer, the amount so transferred shall be in addition to the
6 amount appropriated to be transferred in such following fiscal year and
7 shall be apportioned to each school district in the same amount as each would
8 have received had the transfer been made in the year the deficiency occurred.
9 The state department of education shall distribute to the school district
10 the full amount of the special transfer as soon as practical after such
11 transfer is made. In making the levy computations required by this subsec-
12 tion the state department of education shall take into account and consider
13 the full amount of money receipted into the public school income fund from
14 all sources for the given fiscal year. Deficits in the transfer of the ap-
15 propriated amount of general account revenue to the public school income
16 fund shall be reduced by the amount, if any, that the total amount receipted
17 from other sources into the public school income fund exceeds the official
18 estimated amount from those sources. The official estimate of receipts from
19 other sources shall be the total amount stated by the legislature in the ap-
20 propriation bill. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any
21 transfers to or from the public education stabilization fund.
22 5. Any apportionments in any year, made to any school district, which
23 may within the succeeding three (3) year period be found to have been in error
24 either of computation or transmittal, may be corrected during the three (3)
25 year period by reduction of apportionments to any school district to which
26 over-apportionments may have been made or received, and corresponding ad-
27 ditions to apportionments to any school district to which under-apportion-
28 ments may have been made or received.
29 SECTION 5. That Section 33-1018, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
30 amended to read as follows:
31 33-1018. PUBLIC SCHOOL DISCRETIONARY FUNDING VARIABILITY. (1) The
32 state department of education shall calculate the weighted per-student
33 funding formula as defined in section 33-1001, Idaho Code, to allocate ed-
34 ucational support program funding to school districts and public charter
35 schools. The state department of education shall utilize the information
36 reported on weighted student characteristics as defined in section 33-1001,
37 Idaho Code, from local education agencies pursuant to sections 33-1027 and
38 33-1028, Idaho Code.
39 (2) In fiscal years 2026 and 2027, if the allocation of general discre-
40 tionary funds and state educational support distributions shifted to gen-
41 eral discretionary funds in the current year for a school district or public
42 charter school is less than one hundred percent (100%) of what the alloca-
43 tion would have been if the allocation was based on support units, then an ad-
44 ditional allocation shall be made to that school district or public charter
45 school.
46 (3) The legislature shall annually state in the appropriation for the
47 educational support program/division of operations the estimate of the to-
48 tal discretionary the base funding provided per support unit student as de-
49 termined by the weighted per-student funding formula. The state department

17
1 of education shall, before the end of each fiscal year, calculate the actual
2 discretionary funding available per support unit student as determined by
3 the weighted per-student funding formula.
4 (1) (4) If the total estimated discretionary funding per support unit
5 student as determined by the weighted per-student funding formula stated in
6 the appropriation for the educational support program/division of opera-
7 tions is lower than the actual discretionary funding available per support
8 unit student as determined by the weighted per-student funding formula, then
9 the state controller shall multiply the difference by the number of actual
10 support units, and transfer the result from the public school income fund
11 to the public education stabilization fund and the final distributions to
12 school districts from the department of education shall be reduced by a like
13 amount.
14 (2) (5) If the total estimated discretionary funding per support unit
15 student as determined by the weighted per-student funding formula stated in
16 the appropriation for the educational support program/division of opera-
17 tions is greater than the actual discretionary funding available per support
18 unit student as determined by the weighted per-student funding formula, then
19 the state controller shall multiply the difference by the number of actual
20 support units, and transfer the result from the public education stabiliza-
21 tion fund to the public school income fund. This transfer shall be limited to
22 moneys available in the public education stabilization fund. Moneys trans-
23 ferred from the public education stabilization fund to the public school
24 income fund under the provisions of this section are hereby continuously
25 appropriated for the educational support program/division of operations.
26 SECTION 6. That Section 33-1614, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
27 amended to read as follows:
28 33-1614. CAREER EXPLORATION. (1) Starting in fiscal year 2024, every
29 student in grade 7 or grade 8 enrolled in an Idaho public school district,
30 a specially chartered district, or a public charter school shall complete
31 one (1) or more career exploration courses. A student may opt out by sub-
32 mitting a form to the school showing the student's parent or legal guardian
33 has consented to the student not participating in the career exploration
34 courses pursuant to this section. Such courses should align to the "first
35 step" standards set by the state board of education for career technical edu-
36 cation. Such courses may be offered face-to-face, through virtual education
37 programs, as online courses, or as hybrid courses consisting of a combina-
38 tion of online and in-person instruction.
39 (2) All staff teaching a career exploration course must have partici-
40 pated in a career exploration professional development course approved by
41 the state board of education.
42 (3) The state board of education will maintain resources that can be
43 utilized or modified for the implementation of this section.
44 (4) A career pathway plan shall be developed by students with the ap-
45 proval of parents or guardians, with advice and recommendation from school
46 personnel, which shall include career exploration courses or workforce dis-
47 covery activities. The purpose of a parent-approved student career pathway
48 plan is to outline a course of study and learning activities to help students
49 become successful in life. Every student's career pathway plan shall be re-

18
1 viewed annually and can be revised at any time. The student's school shall
2 provide a personalized career pathway plan progress report to the student's
3 parent or guardian. The progress report may be sent via electronic communi-
4 cation.
5 (5) Funding provided in section 33-1002(2)(r)(q), Idaho Code, in ac-
6 cordance with section 33-1212A, Idaho Code, may be used to support career ex-
7 ploration courses.
8 (6) Professional development funding provided pursuant to section
9 33-1002, Idaho Code, may be used to provide professional development to ca-
10 reer exploration course instructors.
11 SECTION 7. That Section 33-1632, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
12 amended to read as follows:
13 33-1632. MASTERY-BASED EDUCATION. (1) The legislature finds that mov-
14 ing toward mastery-based education where students progress as they demon-
15 strate mastery of a subject or grade level is in the best interest of Idaho
16 students. The legislature further finds that moving from the current time-
17 based system to a mastery-based approach will allow for more personalized
18 and differentiated learning; create a focus on explicit, measurable, trans-
19 ferable learning objectives that empower students; and emphasize competen-
20 cies that include application and knowledge along with skill development.
21 (2) The state department of education shall perform the following ac-
22 tivities to move Idaho toward mastery-based education:
23 (a) Provide ongoing statewide outreach and communications to increase
24 awareness and understanding of and promote interest in mastery-based
25 education for teachers, administrators, parents, students, business
26 leaders, and policymakers;
27 (b) Facilitate and maintain the Idaho mastery education network
28 composed of Idaho public school districts and charter schools that col-
29 laborate to transition Idaho to mastery-based education. The network
30 shall:
31 (i) Advise the superintendent of public instruction and the state
32 board of education on the progress of the transition to mastery-
33 based education;
34 (ii) Develop evidence-based recommendations for continued imple-
35 mentation;
36 (iii) Implement the policies of the legislature and the state
37 board of education for the transition to mastery-based education;
38 and
39 (iv) Provide network resources, including professional develop-
40 ment, coaching, and best practices, to Idaho public school dis-
41 tricts and charter schools; and
42 (c) Create a sustainability plan for statewide scaling of mas-
43 tery-based education and ensure that all public school districts and
44 charter schools participating in the Idaho mastery education network
45 develop plans that describe how the public school district or charter
46 school will maintain a mastery-based approach to education. Plans must
47 include a process to develop the rubrics and assessments necessary to
48 determine mastery and award credit.

19
1 (3) The state department of education may expend or distribute moneys
2 appropriated for purposes identified in subsection (2) of this section di-
3 rectly to public school districts and charter schools that are participating
4 in the mastery education network and have applied and been selected to re-
5 ceive mastery-based education grants. The cost of activities provided for
6 in this section shall be paid by the state department of education from mon-
7 eys appropriated for this program in the educational support program budget
8 as provided for in section 33-1002, Idaho Code.
9 (4) Any public school district or charter school may participate in the
10 mastery education network by applying to the state department of education,
11 even if such district or school is not selected to receive mastery-based edu-
12 cation grants.
13 (5) No later than January 31 of each year, the state department of edu-
14 cation shall report annually to the state board of education and the educa-
15 tion committees of the senate and the house of representatives regarding the
16 progress toward implementing mastery-based education.
17 (6) For purposes of this section:
18 (a) "Mastery-based education " means an education system where student
19 progress is based on a student's demonstration of mastery of competen-
20 cies and content, not seat time or the age or grade level of the student.
21 (b) "Network" means the Idaho mastery education network.
22 SECTION 8. That Section 33-5207, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
23 amended to read as follows:
24 33-5207. PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL FINANCIAL SUPPORT. (1) Except as oth-
25 erwise provided for in this section, the state department of education shall
26 make the following apportionment to each charter school for each fiscal year
27 based on attendance figures submitted in a manner and time as required by the
28 state department of education.
29 (2) Per student support. Computation of support units for each public
30 charter school shall be calculated as if it were a separate school accord-
31 ing to the schedules in section 33-1002(4), Idaho Code, except that public
32 charter schools with fewer than one hundred (100) secondary ADA shall use a
33 divisor of twelve (12) and the minimum units shall not apply. No public char-
34 ter school shall receive an increase in support units that exceeds the sup-
35 port units it received in the prior year by more than forty (40), except in
36 cases of state declared emergencies that have been approved by the autho-
37 rizer as having an impact on public education. Funding from the state ed-
38 ucational support program shall be equal to the total distribution factor
39 weighted per-student funding, plus the salary-based apportionment provided
40 in chapter 10, title 33, Idaho Code. Provided, however, any public char-
41 ter school that is formed by the conversion of an existing traditional public
42 school shall be assigned divisors, pursuant to section 33-1002, Idaho Code,
43 that are no lower than the divisors of the school district in which the tradi-
44 tional public school is located, for each category of pupils listed.
45 (3) Special education. For each student enrolled in the public char-
46 ter school who is entitled to special education services, the public charter
47 school shall receive the state and federal funds from the exceptional child
48 education program for that student that would have been apportioned to the
49 school district in which the public charter school is located.

20
1 (4) Alternative school support. Public charter schools may qualify
2 under the provisions of sections 33-1002 and 33-1002C, Idaho Code, provided
3 the public charter school meets the necessary statutory requirements and
4 students qualify for attendance at an alternative school as provided by rule
5 of the state board of education.
6 (5) Transportation support. Support shall be paid to the public char-
7 ter school as provided in chapter 15, title 33, Idaho Code, and section
8 33-1006, Idaho Code. Each public charter school shall furnish the depart-
9 ment with an enrollment count as of the first Friday in November of public
10 charter school students who are eligible for reimbursement of transporta-
11 tion costs under the provisions of this subsection and who reside more than
12 one and one-half (1 1/2) miles from the school. The state department of edu-
13 cation is authorized to include in the annual appropriation to the charter
14 school sixty percent (60%) of the estimated transportation cost. The final
15 appropriation payment in July shall reflect reimbursements of actual costs
16 pursuant to section 33-1006, Idaho Code. To be eligible for state reimburse-
17 ment under the provisions of section 33-1006, Idaho Code, the student to be
18 transported must reside within the public charter school's primary atten-
19 dance area and must meet at least one (1) of the following criteria:
20 (a) The student resides within the school district in which the public
21 charter school is physically located; or
22 (b) The student resides within fifteen (15) miles by road of the public
23 charter school. The limitations placed by this subsection on the reim-
24 bursement of transportation costs for certain students shall not apply
25 to public virtual schools.
26 (6) Facilities funds.
27 (a) The state department of education shall distribute facilities
28 funds to public charter schools for each student in which a majority
29 of the student's instruction is received at a physical facility that
30 is owned or leased by the public charter school. Such funds shall be
31 used to defray the costs associated with payments for real property used
32 by the students or employees of the public charter school for educa-
33 tional or administrative purposes. Such funds shall be distributed at
34 four hundred dollars ($400) per attending student pursuant to section
35 33-1003A, Idaho Code. For the purposes of this paragraph, beginning in
36 state fiscal year 2025, "attending student" means each student in aver-
37 age daily attendance in kindergarten through grade 12 at such physical
38 charter school facilities where the student is enrolled; except that,
39 upon formal approval by the state board of education, a charter school
40 may receive an exemption to the physical facility requirement pursuant
41 to the provisions of this paragraph if the student would have attended a
42 physical facility if not for a stated emergency.
43 (b) For those public charter schools that do not receive facilities
44 funds for all enrolled students, the school may submit to the state
45 department of education a reimbursement claim for any costs for which
46 facilities funds may be used. The state department of education shall
47 reduce such claim by the greater of fifty percent (50%) or the percent-
48 age of the school's enrolled students for which the school receives
49 facilities funds and shall pay the balance. Provided, however, that the
50 total reimbursements paid to a public charter school, in combination

21
1 with any facilities stipend received by the school, shall not exceed the
2 amount of facilities funds that would have been received by the school
3 had the school received facilities funds for all students in average
4 daily attendance pursuant to section 33-1003A, Idaho Code. For the
5 purposes of this subsection, the term "real property" shall be used as
6 defined in section 63-201, Idaho Code. A virtual public charter school
7 authorized by the public charter school commission or authorized by a
8 public school district on or after March 1, 2024, shall not be eligible
9 for funds appropriated pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
10 (7) Payment schedule. The state department of education is authorized
11 to make an advance payment of twenty-five percent (25%) of a public charter
12 school's estimated annual apportionment for its first year of operation,
13 and each year thereafter, provided the public charter school is serving more
14 grades or at least ten percent (10%) more classes than the previous year, to
15 assist the school with initial start-up costs or payroll obligations. For
16 a public charter school entering at least its second year of operation, the
17 state department of education may require documentation establishing the
18 need for such an advance payment, including comparative class schedules and
19 proof of a commensurate increase in the number of employees.
20 (a) For a public charter school to receive the advance payment, the
21 school shall submit its anticipated fall membership for each grade
22 level to the state department of education by June 1.
23 (b) Using the figures provided by the public charter school, the state
24 department of education shall determine an estimated annual apportion-
25 ment from which the amount of the advance payment shall be calculated.
26 Advance payment shall be made to the school on or after July 1 but no
27 later than July 31.
28 (c) All subsequent payments, taking into account the onetime advance
29 payment made for the first year of operation, shall be made to the public
30 charter school in the same manner as other traditional public schools in
31 accordance with the provisions of section 33-1009, Idaho Code. A public
32 charter school shall comply with all applicable fiscal requirements of
33 law, except that the following provisions shall not be applicable to
34 public charter schools: that portion of section 33-1004, Idaho Code,
35 relating to reduction of the administrative and instructional staff
36 allowance and the pupil service staff allowance when there is a dis-
37 crepancy between the number allowed and the number actually employed;
38 and section 33-1004E, Idaho Code, for calculation of district staff
39 indices.
40 (8) If an authorizer has reason to believe that a public charter school
41 cannot remain fiscally sound for the remainder of its certificate term, it
42 shall provide the state department of education with written notification of
43 such concern. Upon receiving such notification, the state department of ed-
44 ucation shall have the authority to modify the percentage of the total appro-
45 priation to be paid to the public charter school pursuant to the provisions
46 of section 33-1009 1., Idaho Code, such that equal percentages are paid on
47 each of the prescribed dates.
48 (9) Each public charter school shall pay an authorizer fee to its au-
49 thorizer, not to initially exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), or, in
50 the case of existing charter schools, up to a five-percent (5%) increase of

22
1 the previous year's fee. Authorizers shall annually set the authorizer's
2 fee and in doing so shall document the fees to actual expenditures associated
3 with authorizing.
4 (10) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a public charter school from:
5 (a) Applying for federal grant moneys or for career technical education
6 funding of any source; or
7 (b) Receiving funding or other financial assistance for the establish-
8 ment or operation of a public charter school from any private person or
9 organization.
10 (11) Each student in attendance at a public virtual school shall be
11 funded based on either the actual hours of attendance in the public virtual
12 school on a flexible schedule or the percentage of coursework completed,
13 whichever is more advantageous to the school, up to the maximum of one (1)
14 full-time equivalent student.
15 (12) All federal educational funds shall be administered and dis-
16 tributed to public charter schools, including public virtual schools, that
17 have been designated as a local education agency (LEA), as provided in sec-
18 tion 33-5203, Idaho Code.
19 (13) Nothing in this section prohibits separate face-to-face learning
20 activities or services. In order to be eligible for career technical educa-
21 tion essential components funding, virtual schools may be required to offer
22 some face-to-face instruction in order to meet industry standards, licens-
23 ing requirements, work-based learning requirements, or other requirements
24 set forth by law.
25 (14) The provisions of section 33-1021, Idaho Code, shall apply to pub-
26 lic charter schools provided for in this chapter.
27 SECTION 9. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
28 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
29 July 1, 2025.
