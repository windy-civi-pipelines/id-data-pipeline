36 SECTION 2. That Chapter 30, Title 63, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
37 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
38 ignated as Section 63-3022W, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
39 63-3022W. PRIVATE SCHOOL TUITION AND FEES -- RULEMAKING. (1) For tax-
40 able years commencing January 1, 2026, there shall be allowed for individual
41 taxpayers a deduction to Idaho taxable income an amount equal to the cost
42 of tuition and fees paid by the taxpayer for a qualified dependent child
43 of the taxpayer who is attending a qualified school as defined in section
44 33-6802(8), Idaho Code, offering instruction in grades kindergarten through
45 grade 12 during the taxable year. A school shall be deemed accredited pur-
46 suant to this section if it has been accredited according to the accrediting
47 standards promulgated by the Idaho department of education, the Idaho state

8
1 board of education, or a secular or religious accrediting association recog-
2 nized by the Idaho department of education.
3 (2) As used in this section, a "qualified dependent child" also in-
4 cludes the plural term and means one (1) or more individuals who:
5 (a) Qualifies as a dependent of the taxpayer under section 152, Inter-
6 nal Revenue Code;
7 (b) Is actually claimed as a dependent on the taxpayer's Idaho income
8 tax return;
9 (c) Is a child of the taxpayer, a stepchild of the taxpayer, an individ-
10 ual for whom the taxpayer has been appointed guardian, or a descendant
11 of a child of a taxpayer; and
12 (d) Resides in Idaho for at least one hundred eighty (180) days dur-
13 ing the taxable year. If the qualified dependent child resides in Idaho
14 less than one hundred eighty (180) days, the taxpayer shall be allowed a
15 partial deduction, on a pro rata basis.
16 (3) The deduction to taxable income allowed by this section shall be
17 in the amount of the actual tuition paid by the taxpayer to an Idaho kinder-
18 garten through grade 12 private school, subject to subsection (2)(d) of this
19 section, and shall not include any money received or paid on behalf of a stu-
20 dent pursuant to the Idaho education opportunity program provided chapter
21 68, title 33, Idaho Code.
22 (4) The deduction to taxable income allowed by this section shall be
23 claimed in a manner prescribed by the state tax commission. The deduction
24 provided in this section shall be claimed on only one (1) tax return for any
25 individual qualified dependent child. In the case of divorced parents or
26 parents who do not live together, if the qualified dependent child is in the
27 custody of one (1) or both of the child's parents for more than one-half of a
28 calendar year, such child is the qualified dependent child of the custodial
29 parent for the taxable year beginning during such calendar year. However,
30 the child may be the qualified dependent child of the noncustodial parent if
31 either of the following requirements are met:
32 (a) A court of competent jurisdiction has unconditionally awarded, in
33 writing, to the noncustodial parent the tax benefits associated with
34 the child pursuant to section 32-706, Idaho Code, and the noncustodial
35 parent attaches a copy of the court order to the noncustodial parent's
36 income tax return for the taxable year; or
37 (b) The custodial parent signs a written declaration that such custo-
38 dial parent will not claim the deduction of this section with respect to
39 such child for any taxable year beginning in such calendar year, and the
40 noncustodial parent attaches such written declaration to the noncusto-
41 dial parent's income tax return for the taxable year beginning during
42 such calendar year.
43 (5) The state tax commission shall establish rules, subject to legisla-
44 tive approval, to implement the provisions of this section.
45 SECTION 3. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this act are hereby declared
46 to be severable and if any provision of this act or the application of such
47 provision to any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason,
48 such declaration shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of
49 this act.

9
1 SECTION 4. This act shall be in full force and effect on and after Jan-
2 uary 1, 2026.
