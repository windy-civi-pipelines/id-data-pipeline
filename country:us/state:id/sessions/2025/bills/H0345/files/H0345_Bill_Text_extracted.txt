26 social security act.
27 (2) No later than ninety (90) days after approval of this act, the
28 department shall submit any necessary state plan amendments to the United
29 States department of health and human services, centers for medicare and
30 medicaid services to implement the provisions of this section. The depart-
31 ment is required and authorized to take all actions necessary to implement
32 the provisions of this section as soon as practicable.
33 (3) Eligibility for medicaid as described in this section shall not be
34 delayed if the centers for medicare and medicaid services fail to approve any
35 waivers of the state plan for which the department applies, nor shall such
36 eligibility be delayed while the department is considering or negotiating
37 any waivers to the state plan. The department shall not implement any waiver
38 that would result in a reduction in federal financial participation for per-

47 and house of representatives health and welfare committees shall, as soon
48 as practicable, review the effects of such reduction and make a recommenda-
49 tion to the legislature as to whether medicaid eligibility expansion should
8
1 remain in effect. The review and recommendation described in this subsec-
2 tion shall be conducted by the date of adjournment of the regular legisla-
3 tive session following the date of reduction in federal financial partici-
4 pation. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if the
5 reduction in federal financial participation occurs outside of a state leg-
6 islative session, the department shall take any action necessary to offset
7 the increase in state funding, including but not limited to reductions in
8 provider payment rates or elimination of optional benefits. Such actions
9 shall be taken until such time as the state legislature may convene and de-
10 termine a proper course of action.
11 (6) The department:
12 (a) Shall place all persons participating in medicaid pursuant to

24 amended to read as follows:
25 56-1403. HOSPITAL ASSESSMENT FUND ESTABLISHED. (1) There is hereby
26 created in the office of the state treasurer a dedicated fund to be known
27 as the hospital assessment fund, hereinafter "fund," to be administered by
28 the department of health and welfare, hereinafter "department." The state
29 treasurer shall invest idle moneys in the fund and any interest received on
30 those investments shall be returned to the fund. All moneys in the fund are
31 continuously appropriated to the department for the purposes specified in
32 this chapter.
33 (2) Moneys in the fund shall consist of:
34 (a) All moneys collected or received by the department from private
35 hospital assessments required by this chapter;
36 (b) All federal matching funds received by the department as a result
37 of expenditures made by the department that are attributable to moneys
38 deposited in the fund;
39 (c) Any interest or penalties levied in conjunction with the adminis-
40 tration of this chapter; and
41 (d) Any appropriations, federal funds, donations, gifts or moneys from
42 any other sources.
43 (3) The fund is created for the purpose of receiving moneys in accor-
44 dance with this section and section 56-1404, Idaho Code. Moneys in the fund
45 shall be distributed by the department subject to appropriation for the fol-
46 lowing purposes only:
47 (a) Payments to private hospitals as required under Idaho's medical
48 assistance program as set forth in sections 56-209b through 56-209d,
49 Idaho Code;
9
1 (b) Reimbursement of moneys collected by the department from private
2 hospitals through error or mistake in performing the activities autho-
3 rized under Idaho's medical assistance program;
4 (c) Payments of administrative expenses incurred by the department or
5 its agent in performing the activities authorized by this chapter;
6 (d) Payments made to the federal government to repay excess payments
7 made to private hospitals from the fund if the assessment plan is deemed
8 out of compliance and after the state has appealed the findings. Hospi-
9 tals shall refund the payments in question to the assessment fund. The
10 state in turn shall return funds to both the federal government and hos-
11 pital providers in the same proportion as the original financing. Indi-
12 vidual hospitals shall be reimbursed based on the proportion of the in-
13 dividual hospital's assessment to the total assessment paid by all pri-
14 vate hospitals. If a hospital is unable to refund payments, the state
15 shall develop a payment plan and deduct moneys from future medicaid pay-
16 ments;
17 (e) Transfers to any other fund in the state treasury, provided such
18 transfers shall not exceed the amount transferred previously from that
19 other fund into the hospital assessment fund;
20 (f) Making refunds to hospitals pursuant to section 56-1410, Idaho
21 Code; and
22 (g) Offsetting general funding needed to support Idaho medicaid.
23 SECTION 8. That Section 56-1404, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
24 amended to read as follows:
25 56-1404. ASSESSMENTS. (1) All private hospitals, except those ex-
26 empted under section 56-1408, Idaho Code, shall make payments to the fund in
27 accordance with this chapter. Subject to section 56-1410, Idaho Code, an an-
28 nual assessment on both inpatient and outpatient services is determined for
29 each qualifying hospital for each state fiscal year in an amount calculated
30 by multiplying the rate, as set forth in subsections (2)(c) and (3)(b) of
31 this section, by the assessment base, as set forth in subsection (5) of this
32 section.
33 (2)(a) The department shall calculate the private hospital upper pay-
34 ment limit gap for both inpatient and outpatient services. The upper
35 payment limit gap is the difference between the maximum allowable pay-
36 ments eligible for federal match, less medicaid payments not financed
37 using hospital assessment funds. The upper payment limit gap shall be
38 calculated separately for hospital inpatient and outpatient services.
39 Medicaid disproportionate share payments shall be excluded from the
40 calculation.
41 (b) Idaho medicaid will start work toward approval by the centers for
42 medicare and medicaid services (CMS) of an updated upper payment limit
43 calculation methodology no later than July 1, 2022. This change is
44 needed due to the change reflected in section 56-265, Idaho Code, in re-
45 imbursement from retrospective cost settlements to prospective payment
46 systems.
47 (c) The department shall calculate the upper payment limit assessment
48 rate for each state fiscal year to be the percentage that, when multi-
10
1 plied by the assessment base as defined in subsection (5) of this sec-
2 tion, equals the upper payment limit payment.
3 (d) Beginning July 1, 2022, or upon approval by CMS, whichever is later,
4 the assessment rate referenced in paragraph (c) of this subsection will
5 increase to the amount needed to attain an increased supplemental upper
6 payment limit payment. This payment amount is subject to CMS approval
7 of the updated upper payment limit methodology described in paragraph
8 (a) of this subsection and legislative appropriation shall be continu-
9 ously appropriated.
10 (e) Beginning July 1, 2023, an additional amount will be assessed at
11 thirty percent (30%) of the upper payment limit payment to be utilized
12 for general fund medicaid needs.
13 (f) If CMS does not approve the updated upper payment limit methodology
14 described in paragraph (b) of this subsection, then the additional as-
15 sessment described in paragraph (e) of this subsection shall not be im-
16 plemented.
17 (g) The assessment described in paragraph (e) of this subsection shall
18 be assessed only if the upper payment limit payment is greater than the
19 total assessment.
20 (3)(a) The department shall calculate the disproportionate share al-
21 lotment amount to be paid to private in-state hospitals.
22 (b) The department shall calculate the disproportionate share assess-
23 ment rate for private in-state hospitals to be the percentage that, when
24 multiplied by the assessment base as defined in subsection (5) of this
25 section, equals the amount of state funding necessary to pay the private
26 in-state hospital disproportionate share allotment determined in para-
27 graph (a) of this subsection.
28 (4) For private in-state hospitals, the assessments calculated pur-
29 suant to subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall not be greater than
30 the federal limit as referenced in 42 CFR 433.68 of the assessment base as
31 defined in subsection (5) of this section.
32 (5) The assessment base shall be the hospital's net patient revenue
33 for the applicable period. Net patient revenue, beginning with state fis-
34 cal year 2023, shall be determined using each hospital's fiscal year 2021
35 medicare cost report on file with the department, without regard to any sub-
36 sequent adjustments or changes to such data. If the 2021 cost report has not
37 been filed, the prior year's cost report will be used. Net patient revenue
38 for each state fiscal year thereafter shall be determined in the same manner
39 using a rolling yearly schedule for each hospital's fiscal year medicare
40 cost report.

8 supplanted by the new comprehensive managed care plan required under
9 this section;

11 contracts with predetermined inflationary adjustments or withholding
12 a percentage of capitation if managed care organizations do not meet
13 these cost containment targets; and

15 sign of a comprehensive managed care plan.

5 hundred percent (100%) of the federal poverty level to receive the ad-
6 vance premium tax credit to purchase a qualified health plan through the
7 Idaho health insurance exchange established by chapter 61, title 41,

21 state plan to expand medicaid eligibility to include those persons under
22 sixty-five (65) years of age whose modified adjusted gross income is one hun-
23 dred thirty-three percent (133%) of the federal poverty level or below and
24 who are not otherwise eligible for any other coverage under the state plan,
25 in accordance with sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) and 1902(e)(14) of the
26 social security act.
27 (2) No later than ninety (90) days after approval of this act, the
28 department shall submit any necessary state plan amendments to the United
29 States department of health and human services, centers for medicare and
30 medicaid services to implement the provisions of this section. The depart-
31 ment is required and authorized to take all actions necessary to implement
32 the provisions of this section as soon as practicable.
33 (3) Eligibility for medicaid as described in this section shall not be
34 delayed if the centers for medicare and medicaid services fail to approve any
35 waivers of the state plan for which the department applies, nor shall such
36 eligibility be delayed while the department is considering or negotiating
37 any waivers to the state plan. The department shall not implement any waiver
38 that would result in a reduction in federal financial participation for per-
39 sons identified in subsection (1) of this section below the ninety percent
40 (90%) commitment described in section 1905(y) of the social security act.
41 (4) If section 1905(y) of the social security act is held unlawful or
42 unconstitutional by the United States supreme court, then the legislature
43 shall declare this section to be null, void, and of no force and effect.
44 (5) If federal financial participation for persons identified in sub-
45 section (1) of this section is reduced below the ninety percent (90%) commit-
46 ment described in section 1905(y) of the social security act, then the senate
47 and house of representatives health and welfare committees shall, as soon
48 as practicable, review the effects of such reduction and make a recommenda-
49 tion to the legislature as to whether medicaid eligibility expansion should

8
1 remain in effect. The review and recommendation described in this subsec-
2 tion shall be conducted by the date of adjournment of the regular legisla-
3 tive session following the date of reduction in federal financial partici-
4 pation. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if the
5 reduction in federal financial participation occurs outside of a state leg-
6 islative session, the department shall take any action necessary to offset
7 the increase in state funding, including but not limited to reductions in
8 provider payment rates or elimination of optional benefits. Such actions
9 shall be taken until such time as the state legislature may convene and de-
10 termine a proper course of action.
11 (6) The department:
12 (a) Shall place all persons participating in medicaid pursuant to
13 this section in a care management program authorized under section

19 ate and house of representatives health and welfare committees shall review
20 all fiscal, health, and other impacts of medicaid eligibility expansion pur-
21 suant to this section and shall make a recommendation to the legislature as
22 to whether such expansion should remain in effect.
23 SECTION 7. That Section 56-1403, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
24 amended to read as follows:
25 56-1403. HOSPITAL ASSESSMENT FUND ESTABLISHED. (1) There is hereby
26 created in the office of the state treasurer a dedicated fund to be known
27 as the hospital assessment fund, hereinafter "fund," to be administered by
28 the department of health and welfare, hereinafter "department." The state
29 treasurer shall invest idle moneys in the fund and any interest received on
30 those investments shall be returned to the fund. All moneys in the fund are
31 continuously appropriated to the department for the purposes specified in
32 this chapter.
33 (2) Moneys in the fund shall consist of:
34 (a) All moneys collected or received by the department from private
35 hospital assessments required by this chapter;
36 (b) All federal matching funds received by the department as a result
37 of expenditures made by the department that are attributable to moneys
38 deposited in the fund;
39 (c) Any interest or penalties levied in conjunction with the adminis-
40 tration of this chapter; and
41 (d) Any appropriations, federal funds, donations, gifts or moneys from
42 any other sources.
43 (3) The fund is created for the purpose of receiving moneys in accor-
44 dance with this section and section 56-1404, Idaho Code. Moneys in the fund
45 shall be distributed by the department subject to appropriation for the fol-
46 lowing purposes only:
47 (a) Payments to private hospitals as required under Idaho's medical
48 assistance program as set forth in sections 56-209b through 56-209d,
49 Idaho Code;

9
1 (b) Reimbursement of moneys collected by the department from private
2 hospitals through error or mistake in performing the activities autho-
3 rized under Idaho's medical assistance program;
4 (c) Payments of administrative expenses incurred by the department or
5 its agent in performing the activities authorized by this chapter;
6 (d) Payments made to the federal government to repay excess payments
7 made to private hospitals from the fund if the assessment plan is deemed
8 out of compliance and after the state has appealed the findings. Hospi-
9 tals shall refund the payments in question to the assessment fund. The
10 state in turn shall return funds to both the federal government and hos-
11 pital providers in the same proportion as the original financing. Indi-
12 vidual hospitals shall be reimbursed based on the proportion of the in-
13 dividual hospital's assessment to the total assessment paid by all pri-
14 vate hospitals. If a hospital is unable to refund payments, the state
15 shall develop a payment plan and deduct moneys from future medicaid pay-
16 ments;
17 (e) Transfers to any other fund in the state treasury, provided such
18 transfers shall not exceed the amount transferred previously from that
19 other fund into the hospital assessment fund;
20 (f) Making refunds to hospitals pursuant to section 56-1410, Idaho
21 Code; and
22 (g) Offsetting general funding needed to support Idaho medicaid.
23 SECTION 8. That Section 56-1404, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
24 amended to read as follows:

26 empted under section 56-1408, Idaho Code, shall make payments to the fund in
27 accordance with this chapter. Subject to section 56-1410, Idaho Code, an an-
28 nual assessment on both inpatient and outpatient services is determined for
29 each qualifying hospital for each state fiscal year in an amount calculated
30 by multiplying the rate, as set forth in subsections (2)(c) and (3)(b) of
31 this section, by the assessment base, as set forth in subsection (5) of this
32 section.
33 (2)(a) The department shall calculate the private hospital upper pay-
34 ment limit gap for both inpatient and outpatient services. The upper
35 payment limit gap is the difference between the maximum allowable pay-
36 ments eligible for federal match, less medicaid payments not financed
37 using hospital assessment funds. The upper payment limit gap shall be
38 calculated separately for hospital inpatient and outpatient services.
39 Medicaid disproportionate share payments shall be excluded from the
40 calculation.
41 (b) Idaho medicaid will start work toward approval by the centers for
42 medicare and medicaid services (CMS) of an updated upper payment limit
43 calculation methodology no later than July 1, 2022. This change is
44 needed due to the change reflected in section 56-265, Idaho Code, in re-
45 imbursement from retrospective cost settlements to prospective payment
46 systems.
47 (c) The department shall calculate the upper payment limit assessment
48 rate for each state fiscal year to be the percentage that, when multi-

10
1 plied by the assessment base as defined in subsection (5) of this sec-
2 tion, equals the upper payment limit payment.
3 (d) Beginning July 1, 2022, or upon approval by CMS, whichever is later,
4 the assessment rate referenced in paragraph (c) of this subsection will
5 increase to the amount needed to attain an increased supplemental upper
6 payment limit payment. This payment amount is subject to CMS approval
7 of the updated upper payment limit methodology described in paragraph
8 (a) of this subsection and legislative appropriation shall be continu-
9 ously appropriated.
10 (e) Beginning July 1, 2023, an additional amount will be assessed at
11 thirty percent (30%) of the upper payment limit payment to be utilized
12 for general fund medicaid needs.
13 (f) If CMS does not approve the updated upper payment limit methodology
14 described in paragraph (b) of this subsection, then the additional as-
15 sessment described in paragraph (e) of this subsection shall not be im-
16 plemented.
17 (g) The assessment described in paragraph (e) of this subsection shall
18 be assessed only if the upper payment limit payment is greater than the
19 total assessment.
20 (3)(a) The department shall calculate the disproportionate share al-
21 lotment amount to be paid to private in-state hospitals.
22 (b) The department shall calculate the disproportionate share assess-
23 ment rate for private in-state hospitals to be the percentage that, when
24 multiplied by the assessment base as defined in subsection (5) of this
25 section, equals the amount of state funding necessary to pay the private
26 in-state hospital disproportionate share allotment determined in para-
27 graph (a) of this subsection.
28 (4) For private in-state hospitals, the assessments calculated pur-
29 suant to subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall not be greater than
30 the federal limit as referenced in 42 CFR 433.68 of the assessment base as
31 defined in subsection (5) of this section.
32 (5) The assessment base shall be the hospital's net patient revenue
33 for the applicable period. Net patient revenue, beginning with state fis-
34 cal year 2023, shall be determined using each hospital's fiscal year 2021
35 medicare cost report on file with the department, without regard to any sub-
36 sequent adjustments or changes to such data. If the 2021 cost report has not
37 been filed, the prior year's cost report will be used. Net patient revenue
38 for each state fiscal year thereafter shall be determined in the same manner
39 using a rolling yearly schedule for each hospital's fiscal year medicare
40 cost report.
41 SECTION 9. The rules contained in IDAPA 16.03.17, Department of Health
42 and Welfare, relating to Medicare/Medicaid Coordinated Plan Benefits, shall
43 be null, void, and of no force and effect on and after July 1, 2025.
44 SECTION 10. The rules contained in IDAPA 16.03.18, Department of Health
45 and Welfare, relating to Medicaid Cost-Sharing, shall be null, void, and of
46 no force and effect on and after July 1, 2025.

11
1 SECTION 11. The rules contained in IDAPA 16.03.09, Department of Health
2 and Welfare, relating to Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits, shall be null, void,
3 and of no force and effect on and after July 1, 2025.
4 SECTION 12. The rules contained in IDAPA 16.03.10, Department of Health
5 and Welfare, relating to Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits, shall be null,
6 void, and of no force and effect on and after July 1, 2025.
7 SECTION 13. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
8 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after its
9 passage and approval.
