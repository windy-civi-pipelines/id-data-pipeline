35 applied uniformly within each category subject to the tax. The city coun-
36 cil or board shall have the power and authority to adopt and collect a tax
37 if approved by a majority of all votes cast by the qualified electors of
38 the city or county voting in an election conducted for that purpose held in

2 fifty-one (51) weeks after an election to approve or disapprove such tax.
3 (3) The rate of the tax shall be the amount approved by the electors but
4 no more than two percent (2%) of the sales price of a product or service sub-
5 ject to the tax.
6 (4) The revenues generated by a tax as provided in this chapter, after
7 the necessary costs of collection and administration and distribution of any
8 refund or credits authorized pursuant to section 63-4604(2), Idaho Code, may
9 only be used to pay for the services that the city or county identifies in

33 tax commission to be paid shall be paid through the state refund account
34 and those moneys are continuously appropriated.
35 (b) An amount shall be distributed to the state tax commission equal to
36 the fee as may be agreed upon between the state tax commission and the

4 within the county's boundaries on a pro rata basis in proportion
5 to the population of each city within the boundaries of the county
6 adopting the tax.
7 63-4605. TAX REPEAL, REAUTHORIZATION, OR RATE CHANGE. The tax or the
8 rate of tax in effect may be changed, repealed, or extended only if approved
