8 We, your Memorialists, the Senate and the House of Representatives of
9 the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Sixty-eighth
10 Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that:
11 WHEREAS, the United States Bureau of Reclamation completed the con-
12 struction of the Teton Dam in 1976 to provide irrigation water, flood
13 protection, electrical power, and water-based recreation; and
14 WHEREAS, the dam suffered a catastrophic failure as the reservoir was
15 being filled with water for the first time; and
16 WHEREAS, the investigation of the dam's failure determined that,
17 although geological factors played a role in the disaster, design and oper-
18 ational decisions and a lack of information also played a role and that the
19 collapse of the dam was avoidable; and
20 WHEREAS, additional water storage in the Eastern Snake Plain continues
21 to be a priority to help address extended periods of drought, population
22 growth, and other demands associated with limited water resources in the
23 state; and
24 WHEREAS, in 2007, the Idaho Department of Water Resources identified
25 the Teton Dam reconstruction as one of two potential large-scale storage
26 projects that warrant consideration; and
27 WHEREAS, studies on other river basins have concluded that there are
28 several potential sites that would provide additional water storage, could
29 be built safely and economically, and would provide significant long-term
30 benefits to the State of Idaho; and
31 WHEREAS, potential projects include rebuilding the Teton Dam and en-
32 larging the Minidoka Dam, Jackson Lake Dam, Twin Springs Dam, Galloway Dam,
33 and Lost Valley Dam; and
34 WHEREAS, Idaho's water resources are vital to the state's economy,
35 agriculture, and growing population, making long-term water storage solu-
36 tions a critical priority; and
37 WHEREAS, rebuilding the Teton Dam would assist with the production of
38 affordable electricity, provide greater security of water supplies to the
39 region, and create valuable new recreation opportunities for the region.
40 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
41 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Rep-
42 resentatives concurring therein, that we support an update to recent studies
43 conducted by the Idaho Department of Water Resources and other water policy
2
1 organizations on the total water storage available in Idaho and additional
2 opportunities for new storage, including the replacement of the Teton Dam.
3 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that we encourage the Bureau of Reclamation, the
4 United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Governor of the State of Idaho,
5 the Idaho Water Resource Board, the Idaho Department of Water Resources, and
6 other federal, state, and local agencies to cooperate with the residents of
7 the State of Idaho in updating or conducting studies to identify and con-
8 struct additional water storage in Idaho, including reconstruction of the
9 Teton Dam.
10 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is
11 hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the
