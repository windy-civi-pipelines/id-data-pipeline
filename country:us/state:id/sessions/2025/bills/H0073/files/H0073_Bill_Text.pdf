3 (60) days prior to any foreclosure sale of the property. Said assessment
4 liens shall not be removed until the assessments are paid or the property
5 is sold for the payment thereof, and shall constitute such lien until paid.

7 property subject to any annual assessments of the district subsequent in

18 to the treasurer of the district as grantee in trust for the district of all
19 property to which a lien has attached as a result of such unpaid assessments.
20 (2) The treasurer shall compile a list of such delinquency entries
21 which shall contain the names of the persons or entities to whom the assess-
22 ments were directed and the amount of such delinquent assessments together
23 with the amount of the penalties to be added thereto. A certified copy of the
24 delinquency list, duly acknowledged by the treasurer, shall be filed with
25 the county recorder of each county in which the properties affected by such
26 delinquent assessments are located, and the treasurer shall then provide by
27 certified mail a notice of delinquency to each ground water user having a
28 delinquent assessment.
29 (3) Upon the payment in full of any delinquent assessment and penalty
30 that was entered on a recorded delinquency list, the treasurer shall file
31 with the county recorder of each county in which the list of delinquent as-
32 sessments was recorded an acknowledged notice that the delinquent assess-
33 ment and any penalty owed has been paid in full. The treasurer shall file any

43 satisfaction of the director of the department of water resources suitable
44 headgates and controlling works at the point where the water is diverted.
45 Each device shall be of such construction that it can be locked and kept
46 closed by the watermaster or other officer in charge, and shall also be of
47 such construction as to regulate the flow of water at the diversion point.

5
1 Each such appropriator shall construct and maintain, when required by the
2 director of the department of water resources, a rating flume, water teleme-
3 try system, or other measuring device at such point as is most practical in
4 such canal, ditch, wellhead or pipeline for the purpose of assisting the
5 watermaster or department in determining the amount of water that may be
6 diverted into said canal, ditch, wellhead or pipeline from the stream, well
7 or other source of public water. Plans for such headgates, rating flumes,
8 water telemetry system, or other measuring devices shall be approved by the
9 department of water resources.
10 (2) If an appropriator determines that installation and maintenance
11 of a measuring device required by the director would be burdensome for his
12 diversion, the appropriator may, upon approval of the director, execute an
13 agreement with the director and submit to the director such information and
14 technical data concerning the diversion and pumping facilities as the di-
15 rector determines necessary to establish the relationship of power usage to
16 water withdrawal by any pump used to divert public water.

22 ter resources within which to begin and diligently pursue to completion the
23 construction or installation of the required device or devices or to begin
24 and diligently pursue to completion a remedy to such defects as exist in
25 accordance with said notice, then the director of the department of water
26 resources may order the duly qualified and acting watermaster of the water
27 district to shut off and refuse to deliver at the point of diversion, the
28 water owned by such appropriator or user until the user does construct and
29 maintain such headgates, controlling works or measuring devices or remedy
30 the defects which exist or the director may take action pursuant to section
31 42-1701B, Idaho Code, to enforce the requirement to construct, install or
32 maintain such devices.
33 (4) The appropriators or users of the public waters of the state of
34 Idaho shall be given a reasonable time within which to complete construction
35 of such headgates, controlling works or measuring devices, depending upon on
36 the size and extent thereof, when due diligence has been used in the prose-
37 cution of such work.

41 sure their water diversions and report said diversions annually thereafter
42 on a form approved by the director of the department of water resources.
43 Such report shall include: a legal description of the point of diversion,
44 the number assigned to each water right diverting from the public waters
45 of the state, the maximum authorized rate of diversion, the maximum rate
46 at which diversions have been made during the reporting period, the total
47 volume diverted during the reporting period, and a description of the phys-
48 ical changes to the diversion works that have been made during the reporting
49 period. The appropriator shall furnish each year the depth to water in any
50 well prior to commencement of pumping, the depth to water during the pumping

6
1 period, and the pressure in the pipe distribution system during diversion if
2 the well is not free flowing. When the director of the department of water
3 resources determines that any person is in substantial violation of any pro-
4 vision of this section or any rule, permit, condition of approval or order
5 issued or promulgated pursuant to this section, the director may commence an
6 administrative enforcement action by issuing a written notice of violation
7 in accordance with the provisions of section 42-1701B, Idaho Code. Subsec-
8 tions (5) and (6) of this section shall not apply to:
9 (a) any Any appropriator or water user with respect to a water right in-
10 cluded in an active water district created pursuant to chapter 6, title
11 42, Idaho Code, the annual report of which meets the reporting require-
12 ments of section 42-708, Idaho Code;
13 (b) any Any irrigation district or ground water district having shown
14 to the satisfaction of the director that they are currently making and
15 recording sufficient measurements of their diversions with measuring
16 methods acceptable to the director and upon their agreement to provide
17 an annual report of their diversions to the director in substantially
18 the same form as required in section 42-708, Idaho Code; and
19 (c) any Any water right included in an active water measurement dis-
20 trict created pursuant to this chapter.
21 (6) The director of the department of water resources shall collect
22 a report processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per diversion re-
23 quired to be reported, including those diversions covered by an agreement
24 in lieu of a measuring device as provided in subsection (2) of this section.
25 Such fee shall be submitted with the annual report of diversions and well
26 data. All such fees received by the department shall be deposited in the wa-
27 ter administration account created pursuant to section 42-238a, Idaho Code,
28 for use by the department to collect, analyze and report water use informa-
29 tion and to regulate water withdrawal and use.
30 (7) All domestic uses, as defined in section 42-111, Idaho Code, and all
31 stock watering uses, as defined in section 42-1401A, Idaho Code, shall be ex-
32 empt from the measuring device installation and maintenance, measuring and
33 reporting requirements of this section.
34 SECTION 6. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
35 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
36 July 1, 2025.
