5 DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.
6 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
7 SECTION 1. That Chapter 3, Title 61, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
8 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
9 ignated as Section 61-335, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
10 61-335. COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT AND RATEPAYER PROTECTION. (1) For the
11 purposes of this section:
12 (a) "New large load" means any electric load associated with a new ser-
13 vice entrance, an existing service entrance, or an expansion of an ex-
14 isting service entrance that results in an increase in power require-
15 ments of such service entrance of thirty (30) megawatts or more in any
16 consecutive twelve (12) month period.
17 (b) The following terms shall have the same meaning as provided for in
18 section 61-332A, Idaho Code:
19 (i) "Commission";
20 (ii) "Consumer";
21 (iii) "Electric service";
22 (iv) "New service entrance";
23 (v) "Public utility"; and
24 (vi) "Service entrance."
25 (2) A public utility providing a new large load service to a customer
26 shall not provide such service from its existing resources or from resources
27 that have been identified and are planned or anticipated to serve its gen-
28 eral body of ratepayers within ten (10) years from the initial date of ser-
29 vice of the new large load. A public utility may recover the costs associated
30 with a new large load service from only that customer and may not recover any
31 costs associated with a new large load service from any other ratepayer. The
32 prohibited costs include but are not limited to cost of capital, generation,
33 transmission, and distribution, and customer-related costs.
34 (3) To further the competitive supply of electric service for a new
35 large load, an electric consumer may receive electric service for a new large
36 load, entirely or in part, from an entity other than the public utility that
37 would otherwise be selected to provide such service pursuant to the electric
38 supplier stabilization act, sections 61-332 through 61-334C, Idaho Code.
39 The public utility shall make its transmission, distribution, and electric
40 supply delivery facilities available, at cost, to facilitate such competi-
41 tively procured electric service.

2
1 (4) A new large load does not change its status as such by means of ar-
2 tifice such as by splitting its load among more than one (1) electric sup-
3 plier or by adding additional connections, meters, or new service entrances
4 to serve an otherwise single entity or enterprise.
5 (5)(a) The commission may promulgate rules, subject to legislative
6 approval, to implement the provisions of this section, facilitate the
7 competitive procurement of electric services for a new large load, and
8 ensure there are no cost shifts from a new large load to the public util-
9 ity's other customers.
10 (b) The commission shall have the jurisdiction to resolve all disputes
11 arising under this section.
12 (6) Providing electric service pursuant to this section shall not be
13 construed to:
14 (a) Be a grant of preference or advantage;
15 (b) Subject any person or corporation to any prejudice or disadvantage;
16 or
17 (c) Have established or to maintain any unreasonable difference in
18 rates, charges, or services in any respect.
19 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
20 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
21 July 1, 2025.
