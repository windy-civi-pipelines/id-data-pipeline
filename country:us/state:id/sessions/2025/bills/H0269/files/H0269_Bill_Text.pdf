7 proportion each such district's current property tax budget bears
8 to the sum of the current property tax budgets of all such dis-
9 tricts in the state. Each year, starting with the distribution

41 districts, the state tax commission shall distribute one-fourth (1/4) of
42 this amount certified quarterly to each county. For school districts, the
43 state tax commission shall distribute one-fourth (1/4) of the amount cer-
44 tified quarterly to each school district. For nonschool districts, the

46 (30) calendar days from receipt of moneys from the state tax commission.

49 taxation. The moneys remitted to the county treasurer for replacement of
50 property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602EE, Idaho Code, may

8
1 be considered by the counties and other taxing districts and budgeted at the
2 same time, in the same manner, and in the same year as revenues from taxation
3 on personal property, which these moneys replace. If taxing districts are
4 consolidated, the resulting district is entitled to an amount equal to the
5 sum of the amounts received in the last calendar quarter by each district
6 pursuant to this subsection prior to the consolidation. If a taxing district
7 is dissolved or disincorporated, the state tax commission shall continu-
8 ously distribute to the board of county commissioners an amount equal to the
9 last quarter's distribution prior to dissolution or disincorporation. The
10 board of county commissioners shall determine any redistribution of moneys
11 so received. If a taxing district annexes territory, the distribution of
12 moneys received pursuant to this subsection shall be unaffected. Taxing
13 districts formed after January 1, 2001, are not entitled to a payment under
14 the provisions of this subsection. School districts shall receive an amount

17 property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602EE, Idaho Code, pro-
18 vided that the result of these calculations shall not be less than zero (0).

31 propriated unless the legislature enacts a different appropriation for a
32 particular fiscal year. For purposes of the limitation provided by section
33 63-802, Idaho Code, moneys received pursuant to this section as property tax
34 replacement for property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602KK,
35 Idaho Code, shall be treated as property tax revenues. If taxing districts
36 are consolidated, the resulting district is entitled to an amount equal to
37 the sum of the amounts that were received in the last calendar year by each
38 district pursuant to this subsection prior to the consolidation. If a taxing
39 district or revenue allocation area annexes territory, the distribution of
40 moneys received pursuant to this subsection shall be unaffected. Taxing
41 districts and revenue allocation areas formed after January 1, 2022, are not
42 entitled to a payment under the provisions of this subsection.

44 ($34,000,000) shall be distributed each year by the state tax commission to
