BY STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
1 AN ACT
2 RELATING TO THE GOVERNOR AND DISASTER EMERGENCIES; AMENDING SECTION
3 46-1008, IDAHO CODE, TO REVISE PROVISIONS REGARDING THE GOVERNOR AND
4 DISASTER EMERGENCIES; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND PROVIDING AN EF-
5 FECTIVE DATE.
6 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
7 SECTION 1. That Section 46-1008, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
8 amended to read as follows:
9 46-1008. THE GOVERNOR AND DISASTER EMERGENCIES. (1) Under this act,
10 the governor may issue executive orders and proclamations and may amend or
11 rescind them. Executive orders and proclamations have the force and effect
12 of law; provided, however, that any such orders, proclamations, or rules
13 must be essential to protect life or property from the occurrence or immi-
14 nent threat of the state of disaster emergency threatening the safety of per-
15 sons or property within the state and must be narrowly tailored to effec-
16 tively protect life or property without placing unnecessary restrictions on
17 the ability for a person or persons, regardless of job type or classifica-
18 tion, to work, provide for their families, or otherwise contribute to the
19 economy of the state of Idaho.
20 (2) A If the governor has exercised his authority to convene a special
21 session of the legislature by proclamation under section 9, article IV of
22 the constitution of the state of Idaho, then he may also declare a disaster
23 emergency shall be declared by executive order or proclamation of the gover-
24 nor if he finds a disaster has occurred or that the occurrence or the threat
25 thereof is imminent. The governor may declare a disaster emergency only if
26 the stated purpose for convening the special session includes the matter
27 of the disaster emergency. The state of disaster emergency shall continue
28 until the governor finds that the threat or danger has passed or the disaster
29 has been dealt with to the extent that emergency conditions no longer exist,
30 and when either or both of these events occur, the governor shall terminate
31 the state of disaster emergency by executive order or proclamation; pro-
32 vided, however, that no state of disaster emergency may continue for longer
33 than thirty (30) days unless the governor finds that it should be continued
34 for another thirty (30) days or any part thereof. The governor shall not
35 continue the state of disaster emergency beyond sixty (60) days from the date
36 the disaster emergency was declared. The legislature by concurrent reso-
37 lution may terminate a state of disaster emergency at any time. Thereupon,
38 the governor shall issue an executive order or proclamation ending the state
39 of disaster emergency. All executive orders or proclamations issued under
40 this subsection shall indicate the nature of the disaster, the area or areas
41 threatened, the area subject to the proclamation, and the conditions caus-
42 ing the disaster. An executive order or proclamation shall be disseminated

2
1 promptly by means calculated to bring its contents to the attention of the
2 general public and, unless the circumstances attendant upon the disaster
3 prevent or impede, be promptly filed with the Idaho office of emergency man-
4 agement, the office of the secretary of state, and the office of the recorder
5 of each county where the state of disaster emergency applies.
6 (3) An executive order or proclamation of a state of disaster emergency
7 shall activate the disaster response and recovery aspects of the state, lo-
8 cal, and intergovernmental disaster emergency plans applicable to the po-
9 litical subdivision or area in question and be authority for the deployment
10 and use of any forces to which the plan or plans apply and for use or dis-
11 tribution of any supplies, equipment, and materials and facilities assem-
12 bled, stockpiled, or arranged to be made available pursuant to this act or
13 any other provision of law relating to disaster emergencies.
14 (4) During the continuance of any state of disaster emergency, the
15 governor is commander-in-chief of the militia and may assume command of all
16 other forces available for emergency duty. To the greatest extent prac-
17 ticable, the governor shall delegate or assign command authority by prior
18 arrangement embodied in appropriate executive orders or rules, but nothing
19 herein restricts his authority to do so by orders issued at the time of the
20 disaster emergency.
21 (5) In addition to any other powers conferred upon the governor by law,
22 he may:
23 (a) Suspend the provisions of any rules prescribing the procedures for
24 conduct of public business that would in any way prevent, hinder, or de-
25 lay necessary action in coping with the emergency;
26 (b) Utilize all resources of the state, including, but not limited to,
27 those sums in the disaster emergency account as he shall deem necessary
28 to pay obligations and expenses incurred during a declared state of dis-
29 aster emergency;
30 (c) Transfer the direction, personnel, or functions of state depart-
31 ments and agencies or units thereof for the purpose of performing or fa-
32 cilitating emergency services;
33 (d) Subject to any applicable requirements for compensation under sec-
34 tion 46-1012, Idaho Code, and except as provided in subsection (7)(c) of
35 this section, commandeer or utilize any private property, real or per-
36 sonal, if he finds this necessary to cope with the disaster emergency;
37 (e) Direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population
38 from any stricken or threatened area within the state if he deems this
39 action necessary for the preservation of life or other disaster mitiga-
40 tion, response, or recovery;
41 (f) Prescribe routes, modes of transportation, and destinations in
42 connection with evacuation;
43 (g) Control ingress and egress to and from a disaster area, the movement
44 of persons within the area, and the occupancy of premises therein;
45 (h) Suspend or limit the sale, dispensing or transportation of alco-
46 holic beverages, explosives, and combustibles; and
47 (i) Make provision for the availability and use of temporary emergency
48 housing.

3
1 (6) Whenever an emergency or a disaster has been declared to exist in
2 Idaho by the president under the provisions of the disaster relief act of
3 1974 (P.L. 93-288, 42 U.S.C. 5121), as amended, the governor may:
4 (a) Enter into agreements with the federal government for the sharing
5 of disaster recovery expenses involving public facilities;
6 (b) Require as a condition of state assistance that a local taxing dis-
7 trict be responsible for paying forty percent (40%) of the nonfederal
8 share of costs incurred by the local taxing district that have been de-
9 termined to be eligible for reimbursement by the federal government,
10 provided that the total local share of eligible costs for a taxing dis-
11 trict shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the taxing district's tax
12 charges authorized by section 63-802, Idaho Code;
13 (c) Obligate the state to pay the balance of the nonfederal share of el-
14 igible costs within local taxing entities qualifying for federal assis-
15 tance; and
16 (d) Enter into agreements with the federal government for the sharing
17 of disaster assistance expenses to include individual and family grant
18 programs.
19 (7) During the continuance of any state of disaster emergency, neither
20 the governor nor any agency of any governmental entity or political subdivi-
21 sion of the state shall:
22 (a) Impose or enforce any additional restrictions on the lawful man-
23 ufacturing, possession, transfer, sale, transport, storage, display
24 or use of firearms or ammunition or their components or accessories, or
25 otherwise limit or suspend any rights guaranteed by the United States
26 constitution or the constitution of the state of Idaho, including but
27 not limited to the right to peaceable assembly or free exercise of re-
28 ligion. The transport, storage, transfer, sale, commerce in, import
29 and export of, distribution, repair, maintenance, and manufacture of
30 firearms, ammunition, and related accessories and components, shooting
31 ranges, and other goods and services directly related to lawful firearm
32 possession, use, storage, repair, maintenance, sale or transfer, and
33 training in the use of firearms are declared to be life-sustaining,
34 essential businesses and services for the purposes of safety and secu-
35 rity in times of declared emergency or any other statutorily authorized
36 responses to disaster, war, acts of terrorism, riot or civil disorder,
37 public health crises, or emergencies of whatever kind or nature;
38 (b) Suspend or revoke a license to carry concealed weapons or refuse
39 to accept and process an application for a license to carry concealed
40 weapons, except in accordance with the provisions of chapter 33, title
41 18, Idaho Code; or
42 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (5) of this section,
43 seize, commandeer, or confiscate in any manner any privately owned
44 firearm, ammunition, or firearms or ammunition components that are pos-
45 sessed, carried, displayed, sold, transferred, transported, stored, or
46 used in connection with otherwise lawful conduct.
47 (8) During any state of disaster emergency, the governor may not alter,
48 adjust, or create any provision of the Idaho Code.
