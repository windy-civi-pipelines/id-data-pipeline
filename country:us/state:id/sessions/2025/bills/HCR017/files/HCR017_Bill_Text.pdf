LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF IDAHO
Sixty-eighth Legislature First Regular Session - 2025
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 17
BY STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
1 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
2 STATING FINDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND DENOUNCING ACTS OF POLITICAL VIO-
3 LENCE AND INTIMIDATION.
4 Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
5 WHEREAS, the foundation of a free and civil society is the ability to en-
6 gage in open and respectful political discourse without fear of violence or
7 retribution; and
8 WHEREAS, recent events in North Idaho have involved acts of violence and
9 intimidation, including the disruption of a public meeting by pulling a fire
10 alarm, an assault on a trustee, the arson of a legislator's place of busi-
11 ness, threats to burn down a legislator's residence, and threats to murder a
12 legislator; and
13 WHEREAS, these acts of violence and intimidation are unacceptable in a
14 constitutional republic and have no place in the political process of the
15 State of Idaho; and
16 WHEREAS, political disagreements must be resolved through debate, due
17 process, and democratic means, rather than through threats, destruction, or
18 harm to individuals or property; and
19 WHEREAS, such acts of violence and intimidation do not represent the
20 values of the people of Idaho, who respect the rule of law, the democratic
21 process, and the principles of free speech and civil discourse; and
22 WHEREAS, law enforcement agencies should be fully supported in investi-
23 gating and prosecuting acts of political violence to ensure that justice is
24 served and to deter future threats and attacks, but such agencies must also
25 be held accountable to ensure they are not selectively enforcing laws based
26 on political considerations; and
27 WHEREAS, all elected officials, public servants, and citizens, regard-
28 less of political affiliation, deserve to feel safe in their communities and
29 places of work; and
30 WHEREAS, Idaho's leaders must take a firm and unequivocal stand against
31 all forms of political violence and intimidation to preserve public trust in
32 our institutions and to uphold the state's commitment to law and order.
33 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
34 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and
35 the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature hereby denounces acts of
36 political violence and intimidation in the strongest possible terms and com-
37 mits to fostering a culture of respect, civility, and lawful engagement in
38 the democratic process.
39 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that copies of this resolution be transmitted to
40 the Governor of the State of Idaho, the Attorney General, and local law en-
41 forcement agencies to reaffirm the state's commitment to maintaining law and
42 order and protecting public officials and citizens from politically moti-
43 vated violence.
