29 or treatment and the adoption agency selected by the department of health

31 prospective adoptive family within forty-eight (48) hours, the child shall
32 be left in the care of a hospital, and the peace officer or other person
33 appointed by the court shall notify the court and prosecutor of the action
34 taken and the location of the child so that a shelter care hearing may be
35 held.

37 an Indian child, the jurisdiction of the Indian child welfare act (ICWA), 25
38 U.S.C. 1901, et seq., applies. If a party knows or has reason to know that the
39 child is an Indian child, the department of health and welfare shall send im-
40 mediate ICWA notification to the child's Indian tribe and to any other tribe
41 or to the bureau of Indian affairs as required by ICWA or federal regulations
42 implementing ICWA. Within ten (10) days of receiving the information that
43 causes the department of health and welfare to know or have reason to know
44 that the child is an Indian child, the department shall issue any notice re-
45 quired by this subsection.
46 (3) (5) A peace officer or other person appointed by the court who takes
