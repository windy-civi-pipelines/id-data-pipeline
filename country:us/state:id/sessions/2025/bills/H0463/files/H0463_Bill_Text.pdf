42 On this.... day of...., 20.., before me, the undersigned....,....
43 (Judge or Magistrate) of the District Court of the.... Judicial District of
44 the state of Idaho, in and for the county of...., personally appeared....,
45 known to me (or proved to me on the oath of....) to be the person(s) whose

1 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and affixed my official
2 seal the day and year in this certificate first above written.
3 ...................... (District Judge or Magistrate)
4 (6) The court shall accept a consent or a surrender and release executed
5 in another state if:
6 (a) It is witnessed by a magistrate or district judge of the state where
7 signed; or
8 (b) The court receives an affidavit or a certificate from a court of
9 comparable jurisdiction stating that the consent or the surrender and
10 release was executed in accordance with the laws of the state in which it
11 was executed, or the court is satisfied by other showing that the con-
12 sent or surrender and release was executed in accordance with the laws
13 of the state in which it was executed.
14 (7) The court shall accept a termination or relinquishment from a sis-
15 ter state that has been ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction under
16 like proceedings; or in any other manner authorized by the laws of a sister
17 state. In a state where the father has failed to file notice of claim to pa-
18 ternity and willingness to assume responsibility as provided for pursuant to
19 the laws of such state, and where such failure constitutes an abandonment of
20 such child and constitutes a termination or relinquishment of the rights of
21 the putative father, the court shall accept such failure as a termination in
22 this state without further hearing on the merits, if the court is satisfied
23 that such failure constitutes a termination or relinquishment of parental
24 rights pursuant to the laws of that state.
25 (8) Unless a consent to termination signed by the parent(s) of the child
26 has been filed by an adoption agency licensed in the state of Idaho, or unless
27 the consent to termination was filed in conjunction with a petition for adop-
28 tion of the child, the court shall hold a hearing.
29 (9) If the parent has a disability, as defined in this chapter, the par-
30 ent shall have the right to provide evidence to the court regarding the man-
31 ner in which the use of adaptive equipment or supportive services will enable
32 the parent to carry out the responsibilities of parenting the child. Nothing
33 in this section shall be construed to create any new or additional obligation
34 on state or local governments to purchase or provide adaptive equipment or
35 supportive services for parents with disabilities.
36 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
37 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
38 July 1, 2025.
