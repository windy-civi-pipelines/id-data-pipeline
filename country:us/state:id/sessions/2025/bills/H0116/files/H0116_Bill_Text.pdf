6 quirements of this section notwithstanding any assessments paid or
7 payable by small employer carriers pursuant to section 41-4711, Idaho

9 (f)(i) Small employer carriers shall apply rating factors, in-

34 carriers are consistent with the purposes of this chapter, including
35 rules that:
36 (i) Assure that differences in rates charged for health benefit
37 plans by small employer carriers are reasonable and reflect objec-
38 tive differences in plan design, not including differences due to
39 the nature of the groups assumed to select particular health bene-
40 fit plans;
41 (ii) Prescribe the manner in which case characteristics may be
42 used by small employer carriers; and
43 (iii) Prescribe the manner in which a small employer carrier is to

48 untarily into or out of a class of business. A small employer carrier shall

6 ployer carrier for one (1) or more rating periods upon a filing by the small
7 employer carrier and a finding by the director either that the suspension is
8 reasonable in light of the financial condition of the small employer carrier
9 or that the suspension would enhance the efficiency and fairness of the mar-
10 ketplace for small employer health insurance.

12 to a small employer, a small employer carrier shall make a reasonable disclo-
13 sure, as part of its solicitation and sales materials, of all of the follow-
14 ing:
15 (a) The extent to which premium rates for a specified small employer are
16 established or adjusted based upon on the actual or expected variation

29 tices are based upon on commonly accepted actuarial assumptions and are
30 in accordance with sound actuarial principles.
31 (b) Each small employer carrier shall file with the director annually
32 on or before March 15, an actuarial certification certifying that the
33 carrier is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and that

36 information, as specified by the director. A copy of the certification
37 shall be retained by the small employer carrier at its principal place
38 of business.

45 employer carrier or as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.

16 the base premium rate, provided that such change does not exceed,
17 on a percentage basis, the change in the new business premium rate
18 for the most similar health benefit plan into which the individual
19 carrier is actively enrolling new individuals.
20 (ii) Any adjustment, not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) annually
21 and adjusted pro rata for rating periods of less than one (1) year,
22 due to the claim experience, health status or duration of coverage
23 of the individual or dependents as determined from the individual
24 carrier's rate manual; and
25 (iii) Any adjustment due to change in coverage or change in the
26 case characteristics of the individual as determined from the in-
27 dividual carrier's rate manual.
28 (c) Premium rates for health benefit plans shall comply with the re-
29 quirements of this section notwithstanding any assessments paid or
30 payable by carriers pursuant to section 41-4711, Idaho Code, or chapter
31 55, title 41, Idaho Code.
32 (d)(i) Individual carriers shall apply rating factors, including
33 case characteristics, consistently with respect to all individu-
34 als. Rating factors shall produce premiums for identical individ-
35 uals which differ only by the amounts attributable to plan design
36 and do not reflect differences due to the nature of the individuals
37 assumed to select particular health benefit plans; and
38 (ii) An individual carrier shall treat all health benefit plans
39 issued or renewed in the same calendar month as having the same
40 rating period.
41 (e) For purposes of this subsection, a health benefit plan that uti-
42 lizes a restricted provider network shall not be considered similar
43 coverage to a health benefit plan that does not utilize such a network,
44 provided that utilization of the restricted provider network results in
45 substantial differences in claims costs.
46 (f) The individual carrier shall not use case characteristics, other
47 than age, individual tobacco use, geography as defined by rule of the
48 director, or gender, without prior approval of the director.
49 (g) An individual carrier may utilize age as a case characteristic in
50 establishing premium rates, provided that the same rating factor shall

11
1 be applied to all dependents under twenty-five (25) years of age, and
2 the same rating factor may be applied on an annual basis as to individu-
3 als or nondependents twenty (20) years of age or older.
4 (h) The director may establish rules to implement the provisions of
5 this section and to assure that rating practices used by individual car-
6 riers are consistent with the purposes of this chapter, including rules
7 that:
8 (i) Assure that differences in rates charged for health benefit
9 plans by individual carriers are reasonable and reflect objective
10 differences in plan design, not including differences due to the
11 nature of the individuals assumed to select particular health ben-
12 efit plans;
13 (ii) Prescribe the manner in which case characteristics may be
14 used by individual carriers; and
15 (iii) Prescribe the manner in which an individual carrier is to
16 demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this section, in-
17 cluding requirements that an individual carrier provide the di-
18 rector with actuarial certification as to such compliance.
19 (2) The director may suspend for a specified period the application of
20 subsection (1)(a) of this section as to the premium rates applicable to one
21 (1) or more individuals for one (1) or more rating periods upon a filing by
22 the individual carrier and a finding by the director either that the suspen-
23 sion is reasonable in light of the financial condition of the individual car-
24 rier or that the suspension would enhance the efficiency and fairness of the
25 marketplace for individual health insurance.
26 (3) In connection with the offering for sale of any health benefit plan
27 to an individual, an individual carrier shall make a reasonable disclosure,
28 as part of its solicitation and sales materials, of all of the following:
29 (a) The extent to which premium rates for an individual are established
30 or adjusted based upon on the actual or expected variation in claims
31 costs or actual or expected variation in health status of the individual
32 and his dependents;
33 (b) The provisions of the health benefit plan concerning the individ-
34 ual carrier's right to change premium rates and the factors, other than
35 claim experience, that affect changes in premium rates;
36 (c) The provisions relating to renewability of policies and contracts;
37 and
38 (d) The provisions relating to any preexisting condition provision.
39 (4)(a) Each individual carrier shall maintain at its principal place
40 of business a complete and detailed description of its rating practices
41 and renewal underwriting practices, including information and documen-
42 tation that demonstrate that its rating methods and practices are based
43 upon on commonly accepted actuarial assumptions and are in accordance
44 with sound actuarial principles.
45 (b) Each individual carrier shall file with the director annually on
46 or before September 15, an actuarial certification certifying that the
47 carrier is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and that
48 the rating methods of the individual carrier are actuarially sound.
49 Such certification shall be in a form and manner, and shall contain such
50 information, as specified by the director. A copy of the certification

12
1 shall be retained by the individual carrier at its principal place of
2 business.
3 (c) An individual carrier shall make the information and documentation
4 described in subsection (4)(a) of this section available to the direc-
5 tor upon request. Except in cases of violations of the provisions of
6 this chapter, the information shall be considered proprietary and trade
7 secret information and shall not be subject to disclosure by the direc-
8 tor to persons outside of the department except as agreed to by the indi-
9 vidual carrier or as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
10 SECTION 12. That Section 41-5210, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby

30 hearing.
31 (4) The director may rescind the approval granted to a risk-assuming
32 carrier under the provisions of this section if the director finds that:
