20 amended to read as follows:
21 33-1004E. DISTRICT'S SALARY-BASED APPORTIONMENT. Each district shall
22 be entitled to a salary-based apportionment calculated as provided in this
23 section.
24 (1) To determine the apportionment for instructional staff, take
25 the amounts indicated on the career ladder table plus the amounts associ-
26 ated with the additional education allocation amounts pursuant to section
27 33-1004B, Idaho Code, and calculate the weighted average. The amount so
28 determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for instruc-
29 tional staff determined as provided in section 33-1004(2), Idaho Code.
30 Full-time instructional staff salaries shall be determined from a salary
31 schedule developed by each district and submitted to the state department of
32 education. No full-time instructional staff member or pupil service staff
33 member on the residency compensation rung shall be paid less than the minimum
34 dollar amount on the career ladder residency compensation rung pursuant to
35 section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, for the applicable fiscal year.
36 (2) Effective July 1, 2022, no full-time instructional staff member
37 or pupil service staff member on the professional or advanced professional
38 compensation rung shall be paid less than the minimum dollar amount on the
39 career ladder professional compensation rung pursuant to section 33-1004B,
40 Idaho Code, for the applicable fiscal year.

3 shall be paid less than the minimum dollar amount on the advanced profes-
4 sional compensation rung pursuant to section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, for the
5 applicable fiscal year.
6 (4) If an instructional staff member has been certified by the national
7 board for professional teaching standards, the staff member shall receive
8 two thousand dollars ($2,000) per year for five (5) years from the year in
9 which national board certification was earned. The district staff allot-
10 ment shall be increased by two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each national
11 board-certified instructional staff member who earned national board cer-
12 tification; provided however, that no such awards shall be paid for the pe-
13 riod July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, nor shall any liabilities accrue
14 or payments be made pursuant to this section in the future to any individu-
15 als who would have otherwise qualified for a payment during this stated time
16 period. The resulting amount is the district's salary-based apportionment
17 for instructional staff. For purposes of this section, teachers qualifying
18 for the salary increase shall be those who have been recognized as national
19 board-certified teachers as of July 1 of each year.
20 (5) To determine the apportionment for pupil service staff, take
21 the amounts indicated on the career ladder table plus the amounts associ-
22 ated with the additional education allocation amounts pursuant to section
23 33-1004B, Idaho Code, and calculate the weighted average. If the district
24 does not employ any pupil service staff, the district's pupil service staff
25 average salary shall equal the district's instructional staff average
26 salary for purposes of calculating pupil service salary-based apportion-
27 ment. The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff al-
28 lowance for pupil service staff determined pursuant to section 33-1004(3),
29 Idaho Code. Full-time pupil service staff salaries shall be determined from
30 a salary schedule developed by each district and submitted to the state de-
31 partment of education. The resulting amount is the district's salary-based
32 apportionment for pupil service staff. No full-time pupil service staff
33 member shall be paid less than the minimum dollar amount on the career ladder
34 residency compensation rung pursuant to section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, for
35 the applicable fiscal year.
36 (6) To determine the apportionment for district administrative staff,
37 first determine the district average experience and education index by plac-
38 ing all eligible certificated administrative employees on the statewide
39 index provided in section 33-1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting average is the
40 district index. If the district does not employ any administrative staff,
41 the district administrative index shall equal the statewide average index
42 for purposes of calculating administrative salary-based apportionment.
43 On and after July 1, 2024 2025, the district administrative staff index
44 shall be multiplied by the base salary of forty-four thousand four hundred
45 forty-six dollars ($44,446) forty-six thousand six hundred sixty-eight dol-
46 lars ($46,668). The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district
47 staff allowance for administrative staff determined as provided in section
48 33-1004(4), Idaho Code. The resulting amount is the district's salary-based
49 apportionment for administrative staff. forty-three thousand five hundred
50 eighty-three dollars ($43,583)
4
1 (7) On and after July 1, 2024 2025, to determine the apportionment for
2 classified staff, multiply thirty-nine thousand nine hundred sixty-six dol-
3 lars ($39,966) forty-one thousand nine hundred sixty-four dollars ($41,964)
4 by the district classified staff allowance determined as provided in section
5 33-1004(5), Idaho Code. The amount so determined is the district's appor-
6 tionment for classified staff. thirty-nine thousand one hundred ninety dol-
7 lars ($39,190)
8 (8) The district's salary-based apportionment shall be the sum of the
9 apportionments calculated in subsections (1), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of this
10 section, plus the benefit apportionment as provided in section 33-1004F,
11 Idaho Code.

23 port, $17,197,900 shall be considered reduced from the amounts considered
24 expended from the Public School Income Fund for the period July 1, 2025,

32 islative approval. The agency receiving the appropriation shall take all
33 necessary actions to ensure that the state is not obligated to replace lost
34 federal funds. Pursuant to Section 67-1917, Idaho Code, the agency will
35 submit an inventory of federal funds utilized by the agency. State funds ap-
36 propriated to satisfy match requirements for federal funds shall be reverted

25 the amounts indicated on the career ladder table plus the amounts associ-
26 ated with the additional education allocation amounts pursuant to section
27 33-1004B, Idaho Code, and calculate the weighted average. The amount so

30 Full-time instructional staff salaries shall be determined from a salary
31 schedule developed by each district and submitted to the state department of

34 residency compensation rung pursuant to section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, for
