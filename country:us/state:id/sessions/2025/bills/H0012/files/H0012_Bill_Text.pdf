9 SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. The purpose of this act is to protect

11 from purchasing land near military bases or from purchasing agricultural
12 land, forest land, water rights, mining claims, or mineral rights.
13 SECTION 2. That Section 55-103, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
14 amended to read as follows:
15 55-103. WHO MAY OWN PROPERTY. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2)
16 or (3) of this section, any person, whether citizen or alien, may take, hold,
17 and dispose of property, real or personal.
18 (2) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, on and af-
19 ter the effective date of this subsection, a foreign government or a foreign
20 state-controlled enterprise shall not purchase, acquire, or hold any con-
21 trolling interest in agricultural land, forest land, water rights, mining
22 claims, or mineral rights in the state of Idaho. This subsection does not
23 apply to any interest in agricultural land, forest land, water rights, min-
24 ing claims, or mineral rights acquired by a foreign government or foreign

30 tural land, water rights, mining claims, or mineral rights in the state of

33 ties in a publicly traded company owning the land and if the foreign princi-
34 pal's ownership in the company is either:

37 istered equities; or

39 is both registered with the United States securities and exchange com-
40 mission as an investment advisor under the investment advisers act of
41 1940, as amended, and is not a foreign entity.

2

2 controls agricultural land in the state of Idaho must sell, transfer, or
3 otherwise divest itself of the agricultural land within one hundred eighty
4 (180) days of the effective date of this act.
5 (5) A foreign principal that directly or indirectly owns or acquires
6 agricultural land or any interest in such land in this state must register
7 with the Idaho state department of agriculture within sixty (60) days of the
8 effective date of this act or the date of acquisition, whichever is latest.
9 The department must establish a form for such registration, which, at a mini-
10 mum, must include all of the following:
11 (a) The name of the owner of the agricultural land or the owner of the
12 interest in such land;
13 (b) The address of the agricultural land, the property appraiser's par-
14 cel identification number, and the property's legal description; and

17 foreign principal from a foreign adversary country may acquire agricultural
18 land on or after July 1, 2025, by devise or descent, through the enforcement
19 of security interests, or through the collection of debts, provided that the
20 foreign principal sells, transfers, or otherwise divests itself of the agri-
21 cultural land within one hundred eighty (180) days of acquiring the agricul-
22 tural land.

24 agreements in conflict with this law shall be deemed invalid from the date of
25 adoption unless otherwise provided.

27 ject to legislative approval, to implement the provisions of this section.

30 any qualifying whistleblower, and no other individual or entity. An indi-
31 vidual or entity who is not a foreign entity shall not be required to deter-
32 mine or inquire whether another person or entity is or may be subject to the
33 provisions of this section and shall bear no civil or criminal liability un-
34 der this section.

36 divest the public or private lands as required by this section, the attorney
37 general shall commence an action in the district court within the jurisdic-
38 tion of the public or private land.
39 (11) If the public or private land is held in violation of this sec-
40 tion, the district court shall order that the public or private land be sold
41 through judicial foreclosure.

43 der of priority, except for liens that, under the terms of the sale, are to
