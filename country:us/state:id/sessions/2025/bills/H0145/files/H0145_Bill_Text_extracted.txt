46 practices that may unduly impact and congest the department's rights-
47 of-way;
48 (b) A requirement that a broadband provider shall be charged for the
49 actual cost incurred by the department or district as a result of the
50 installation of a broadband provider's broadband infrastructure. If
4
1 there is more than one (1) broadband provider installing broadband
2 infrastructure, then each broadband provider shall share equally in
3 the common charges of the installation of broadband infrastructure,
4 including but not limited to trenching, boring, traffic controls, and

14 the Idaho administrative procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho
15 Code.
16 (9) The department or district may not grant any longitudinal access
17 under this section that results in a significant compromise of the safe, ef-
18 ficient, and convenient use of a highway for the traveling public.
19 SECTION 4. That Section 40-520, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
20 amended to read as follows:
21 40-520. RIGHTS-OF-WAY FOR BROADBAND. (1) Except as provided in sub-
22 section (5) of this section, the department or district shall allow a broad-
23 band provider longitudinal use and access to the rights-of-way of a highway
24 for the installation, operation, and maintenance of broadband infrastruc-
25 ture.
26 (2) The department or district shall enter into a license agreement
27 with a broadband provider and issue a permit before granting it any longi-
28 tudinal access under this section. Except as specifically provided by the
29 agreement, a property interest in a right-of-way may not be granted under the
30 provisions of this section. An agreement entered into by the department or
31 district under this section:
32 (a) Shall include terms and conditions that are nondiscriminatory as
33 among broadband providers and are consistent with the public policy
34 promoting the expansion of broadband infrastructure in Idaho, such as
35 liability provisions, requirements related to the financial responsi-
36 bilities for future relocation of underground broadband infrastructure
37 if relocation is necessary, and indemnification provisions;
38 (b) Shall specify maintenance responsibilities for broadband infra-
39 structure being placed;
40 (c) May require that the department be allowed to utilize the broadband
41 infrastructure only for public safety warnings, road condition notifi-
42 cations, and amber alerts to motorists on highways;
43 (d) May With respect to the department, the agreement may require that
44 the broadband provider install conduit for nonexclusive use, in which
45 the cost of the project shall be shared proportionally. Alternatively,
46 if the department requires the broadband provider to install only one
47 (1) conduit of equal or smaller size of the conduit being installed ex-
48 clusively for internal department purposes, then the department shall
49 be responsible only for the costs of the additional materials and labor
5
1 for the installation of its own conduit. The department must keep all
2 documents and records regarding the internal use of the conduit and make
3 public such documents if requested. The department may not allow the
4 use of its internal conduit to any other entity. If the department al-
5 lows the use of internal conduit to another entity, then the department
6 shall reimburse the broadband provider for half of the project costs;
7 (e) Shall specify that the broadband provider shall own its broadband
8 infrastructure; and
9 (f) Shall specify that the use of the rights-of-way shall be nonexclu-
10 sive.
11 (3) A broadband provider shall be responsible for the costs of in-
12 stalling its own broadband infrastructure on the department's or the
13 district's right-of-way. If there is more than one (1) broadband provider
14 installing broadband infrastructure at the same project, then the broadband
15 provider is responsible for its pro rata share of the cost.
16 (4) The department or district shall require the same fees from a broad-
17 band provider under this section for longitudinal access to the right-of-way
18 as a public utility defined under section 61-129, Idaho Code. However, fees
19 charged to a cable provider shall be in accordance with applicable federal
20 law.
21 (5) The department or district may not grant any longitudinal access
22 under this section that results in a significant compromise of the safe, ef-
23 ficient, and convenient use of a highway for the traveling public.
24 (6) The department may install conduit for its own use where appro-
25 priate or in support of expanding broadband infrastructure in the state of
26 Idaho.
27 (7) The department and district shall promulgate rules:
28 (a) Governing the installation, operation, and maintenance of broad-
29 band infrastructure granted longitudinal access pursuant to this sec-
30 tion;
31 (b) Specifying the procedures for establishing an agreement for longi-
32 tudinal access for a broadband provider;
33 (c) Specifying criteria for the installation of the department's own
34 conduit and use of such conduit by broadband providers consistent with
35 this section. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply only to the
36 department; and
37 (d) Providing for the relocation or removal of broadband infrastruc-
38 ture for needed changes to a highway on the interstate system.
39 (8) Nothing in section 40-515, Idaho Code, through this section is in-
40 tended to preempt, diminish, or otherwise limit the authority of the depart-
41 ment or district over public rights-of-way.
42 SECTION 5. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
43 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
44 July 1, 2025.

27 of broadband infrastructure if relocation is necessary, and indemnifica-
28 tion provisions. The department or district may deny the installation of
29 broadband infrastructure if the installation hinders or obstructs highway
30 construction, maintenance, or operational safety, is contrary to statute or
31 rule, or unduly delays or interferes with construction, maintenance, joint
32 trenching projects, or the repair or construction of water, wastewater,
33 electrical, or gas line facilities.
34 (7) The department may install conduit for its own use where appro-
35 priate or in support of expanding broadband infrastructure in the state of
36 Idaho.
37 (8) The department and district shall promulgate and follow rules for
38 carrying out the provisions of this section that are nondiscriminatory, neu-
39 tral, fair, and objective as between all broadband providers and that pro-
40 mote competition among broadband providers. Rules shall include, at a mini-
41 mum:
42 (a) Procedures consistent with the "Dig Once Policy" for processing and
43 reviewing statements of interest received from a broadband provider by
44 the department or district. Consistent with the "Dig Once Policy," the
45 department or district shall issue rules that will restrict speculative
46 practices that may unduly impact and congest the department's rights-
47 of-way;
48 (b) A requirement that a broadband provider shall be charged for the
49 actual cost incurred by the department or district as a result of the
50 installation of a broadband provider's broadband infrastructure. If

4
1 there is more than one (1) broadband provider installing broadband
2 infrastructure, then each broadband provider shall share equally in
3 the common charges of the installation of broadband infrastructure,
4 including but not limited to trenching, boring, traffic controls, and
5 make-ready costs;
6 (c) Criteria for identifying projects that would be suitable for the
7 placement of broadband infrastructure;
8 (d) Criteria for the installation of the department's own conduit.
9 Rules may allow use of such conduit by broadband providers;
10 (e) Procedures and forms for permitting processes; and
11 (f) A prohibition on districts allowing micro-trenching of a highway;
12 and
13 (f) (g) A contested case administrative appeals process, pursuant to
14 the Idaho administrative procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho
15 Code.
16 (9) The department or district may not grant any longitudinal access
17 under this section that results in a significant compromise of the safe, ef-
18 ficient, and convenient use of a highway for the traveling public.
19 SECTION 4. That Section 40-520, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
20 amended to read as follows:
21 40-520. RIGHTS-OF-WAY FOR BROADBAND. (1) Except as provided in sub-
22 section (5) of this section, the department or district shall allow a broad-
23 band provider longitudinal use and access to the rights-of-way of a highway
24 for the installation, operation, and maintenance of broadband infrastruc-
25 ture.
26 (2) The department or district shall enter into a license agreement
27 with a broadband provider and issue a permit before granting it any longi-
28 tudinal access under this section. Except as specifically provided by the
29 agreement, a property interest in a right-of-way may not be granted under the
30 provisions of this section. An agreement entered into by the department or
31 district under this section:
32 (a) Shall include terms and conditions that are nondiscriminatory as
33 among broadband providers and are consistent with the public policy
34 promoting the expansion of broadband infrastructure in Idaho, such as
35 liability provisions, requirements related to the financial responsi-
36 bilities for future relocation of underground broadband infrastructure
37 if relocation is necessary, and indemnification provisions;
38 (b) Shall specify maintenance responsibilities for broadband infra-
39 structure being placed;
40 (c) May require that the department be allowed to utilize the broadband
41 infrastructure only for public safety warnings, road condition notifi-
42 cations, and amber alerts to motorists on highways;
43 (d) May With respect to the department, the agreement may require that
44 the broadband provider install conduit for nonexclusive use, in which
45 the cost of the project shall be shared proportionally. Alternatively,
46 if the department requires the broadband provider to install only one
47 (1) conduit of equal or smaller size of the conduit being installed ex-
48 clusively for internal department purposes, then the department shall
49 be responsible only for the costs of the additional materials and labor

5
1 for the installation of its own conduit. The department must keep all
2 documents and records regarding the internal use of the conduit and make
3 public such documents if requested. The department may not allow the
4 use of its internal conduit to any other entity. If the department al-
5 lows the use of internal conduit to another entity, then the department
6 shall reimburse the broadband provider for half of the project costs;
7 (e) Shall specify that the broadband provider shall own its broadband
8 infrastructure; and
9 (f) Shall specify that the use of the rights-of-way shall be nonexclu-
10 sive.
11 (3) A broadband provider shall be responsible for the costs of in-
12 stalling its own broadband infrastructure on the department's or the
13 district's right-of-way. If there is more than one (1) broadband provider
14 installing broadband infrastructure at the same project, then the broadband
15 provider is responsible for its pro rata share of the cost.
16 (4) The department or district shall require the same fees from a broad-
17 band provider under this section for longitudinal access to the right-of-way
18 as a public utility defined under section 61-129, Idaho Code. However, fees
19 charged to a cable provider shall be in accordance with applicable federal
20 law.
21 (5) The department or district may not grant any longitudinal access
22 under this section that results in a significant compromise of the safe, ef-
23 ficient, and convenient use of a highway for the traveling public.
24 (6) The department may install conduit for its own use where appro-
25 priate or in support of expanding broadband infrastructure in the state of
26 Idaho.
27 (7) The department and district shall promulgate rules:
28 (a) Governing the installation, operation, and maintenance of broad-
29 band infrastructure granted longitudinal access pursuant to this sec-
30 tion;
31 (b) Specifying the procedures for establishing an agreement for longi-
32 tudinal access for a broadband provider;
33 (c) Specifying criteria for the installation of the department's own
34 conduit and use of such conduit by broadband providers consistent with
35 this section. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply only to the
36 department; and
37 (d) Providing for the relocation or removal of broadband infrastruc-
38 ture for needed changes to a highway on the interstate system.
39 (8) Nothing in section 40-515, Idaho Code, through this section is in-
40 tended to preempt, diminish, or otherwise limit the authority of the depart-
41 ment or district over public rights-of-way.
42 SECTION 5. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
43 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
44 July 1, 2025.
