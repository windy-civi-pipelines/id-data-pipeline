3 SENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED, AND TO THE CON-
4 GRESSIONAL DELEGATION REPRESENTING THE STATE OF IDAHO IN THE CONGRESS
5 OF THE UNITED STATES.
6 We, your Memorialists, the Senate and the House of Representatives of
7 the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Sixty-eighth
8 Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that:
9 WHEREAS, the State of Idaho had the foresight to obtain a water right for
10 Lake Pend Oreille in 1928; and
11 WHEREAS, the Flood Control Act of 1950 authorized the construction of
12 the Albeni Falls project in substantial compliance with the recommendation
13 of the Interim Report of the Chief of Engineers in the Senate Document No. 9;
14 and
15 WHEREAS, among other things, Senate Document No. 9 discusses the water
16 level elevation and duration of such elevation of the proposed Albeni Falls
17 project; and
18 WHEREAS, the Governor and people of Idaho trusted the federal govern-
19 ment enough to agree to support the construction of the Albeni Falls Dam by
20 the Army Corps of Engineers in 1954; and
21 WHEREAS, to benefit the economy and recreation, a full lake from May to
22 October, each year, was promised to the people of Idaho; and
23 WHEREAS, the Albeni Falls Dam contributes to the Lake Pend Oreille basin
24 by providing flood control, impoundment of Idaho's water rights, naviga-
25 tion, and transportation; and
26 WHEREAS, the Dam provides economic benefits, power generation, and wa-
27 ter storage; and
28 WHEREAS, the Dam helps create a scenic and valuable mountain lake that
29 is accessible to Idaho residents and nonresidents for recreation; and
30 WHEREAS, the Dam supports native fish and wildlife; and
31 WHEREAS, overall, the Dam provides numerous invaluable benefits to the
32 health, safety, and welfare of Idaho residents and to the nation as a whole;
33 and
34 WHEREAS, the water in Lake Pend Oreille has been managed in accordance
35 with the Columbia River Treaty; and
36 WHEREAS, the Army Corps of Engineers have stated that management of the
37 water in the lake at levels of 2,051 to 2,051.5 feet in elevation benefits
38 Kokanee spawning and flood management, which starts in late September and
39 ends in mid-June each year; and
40 WHEREAS, the ownership, management, and control of all federally built
41 projects revert to local and state organizations as soon as the federal gov-
42 ernment is fully reimbursed for its reimbursable expenditures; and

2
1 WHEREAS, seventy years of power generation has more than paid for the
2 federal government's investment in the Albeni Falls Dam and should lead to
3 consideration for state ownership.
4 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
5 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Rep-
6 resentatives concurring therein, that Lake Pend Oreille is too valuable to
7 allow the Albeni Falls Dam to be in disrepair and to lack the appropriate ca-
8 pacity to handle the natural and economic responsibilities incumbent on the
9 important structure that so many depend on for their safety, economic inter-
10 ests, and enjoyment.
11 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature calls upon President Trump
12 and the congressional delegation to: direct the immediate and complete re-
13 pair of the Albeni Falls Dam in a way that does not impact the recreational
14 use or economic benefits of Lake Pend Oreille; evaluate the operations of Al-
15 beni Falls Dam to determine if Senate Document No. 9 is being substantially
16 complied with; ensure the promises made to the people of Idaho are kept; de-
17 termine the elevation of water level necessary for Kokanee spawning; deter-
18 mine if the lake level draw-down to 2,051 feet in elevation by November of
19 each year is necessary or if the lake can be maintained at a higher level to
20 allow for emergency and recreational access at more boat ramp locations; de-
21 termine if ownership and operation of the Albeni Falls Dam should reside with
22 the State of Idaho; and determine if the Columbia River Treaty negotiations
23 should include language to codify the operations of Albeni Falls Dam to ac-
24 complish these goals and objectives.
25 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is
26 hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Joint Memorial
27 to the President of the United States, the President of the Senate and the
28 Speaker of the House of Representatives of Congress, and to the congres-
29 sional delegation representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of the
30 United States.
