12 tion amounts. The state tax commission shall calculate the per
13 capita distribution for each city resulting from the previous fis-
14 cal year's distributions.

16 account from the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, then the

20 rent quarter is greater than the balance of the revenue-sharing
21 account for the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, then:
22 1. If the distributions made to the cities during the same
23 quarter of the previous fiscal year were below the base
24 amount established in fiscal year 2020, then the various
25 cities shall first receive a proportional increase up to the
26 base amount for each city and up to a one-percent (1%) in-
27 crease over such base amount. Any remaining moneys shall be
28 distributed to cities with a below-average per capita dis-
29 tribution in the proportion that the population of that city
30 bears to the population of all cities with below-average per
31 capita distributions within the state.
32 2. If the distributions made to the cities during the same
33 quarter of the previous fiscal year were at or above the
34 base amount established in fiscal year 2020, then the cities
35 shall receive the same distribution they received during the
36 same quarter of the previous fiscal year plus a proportional
37 increase up to one percent (1%). Any remaining moneys shall
38 be distributed to the cities with a below-average per capita

43 rent quarter is less than the balance of the revenue-sharing ac-
44 count for the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, then the
45 cities shall first receive a proportional reduction down to the
46 base amount established in fiscal year 2020. If further reduc-
47 tions are necessary, the cities shall receive reductions based on
48 the proportion that each city's population bears to the population
49 of all cities within the state.

14 tributed under this paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be dis-
15 tributed as follows:

17 of section 63-3638(e), Idaho Code, as that subsection ex-
18 isted immediately prior to July 1, 2000, during the fourth

23 paid in the fourth quarter of calendar year 1999, each
24 county's payment shall be reduced proportionately.
25 3. If the dollar amount of money available under this sub-
26 section (10)(b)(ii) in any quarter exceeds the amount paid
27 in the fourth quarter of calendar year 1999, each county
28 shall be entitled to a proportionately increased payment,
29 but such increase shall not exceed one hundred five percent
30 (105%) of the total payment made in the fourth quarter of
31 calendar year 1999.
32 4. If the dollar amount of money available under this sub-
33 section (10)(b)(ii) in any quarter exceeds one hundred five
34 percent (105%) of the total payment made in the fourth quar-
35 ter of calendar year 1999, any amount over and above such
36 one hundred five percent (105%) shall be paid to the various
37 counties in the proportion that the population of the county
38 bears to the population of the state; and
39 (c) Seven and seven-tenths percent (7.7%) of the amount appropriated in
40 this subsection shall be paid to the several counties for distribution
41 to special purpose taxing districts as follows:
42 (i) Each such district that received a payment under the provi-
43 sions of section 63-3638(e), Idaho Code, as such subsection ex-
44 isted immediately prior to July 1, 2000, during the fourth quarter
45 of calendar year 1999, shall be entitled to a like amount during
46 succeeding calendar quarters.
47 (ii) If the dollar amount of money available under this subsec-
48 tion (10)(c) in any quarter does not equal the amount paid in the
49 fourth quarter of calendar year 1999, each special purpose taxing
50 district's payment shall be reduced proportionately.
5
1 (iii) If the dollar amount of money available under this subsec-
2 tion (10)(c) in any quarter exceeds the amount distributed under
3 paragraph (c)(i) of this subsection, each special purpose taxing
4 district shall be entitled to a share of the excess based on the
5 proportion each such district's current property tax budget bears
6 to the sum of the current property tax budgets of all such dis-
7 tricts in the state. Each year, starting with the distribution
8 for the quarter ending December 31, the state tax commission shall
9 calculate this distribution based on the district's current prop-
10 erty tax budgets, including any unrecovered forgone amounts as de-
11 termined under section 63-802(1)(e), Idaho Code. When a special
12 purpose taxing district is situated in more than one (1) county,
13 the state tax commission shall determine the portion attributable
14 to the special purpose taxing district from each county in which it
15 is situated.
16 (iv) If special purpose taxing districts are consolidated, the
17 resulting district is entitled to a base amount equal to the sum of
18 the base amounts received in the last calendar quarter by each dis-
19 trict prior to the consolidation.
20 (v) If a special purpose taxing district is dissolved or disin-
21 corporated, the state tax commission shall continuously distrib-
22 ute to the board of county commissioners an amount equal to the
23 last quarter's distribution prior to dissolution or disincorpora-
24 tion. The board of county commissioners shall determine any re-
25 distribution of moneys so received.
26 (vi) Taxing districts formed after January 1, 2001, are not en-
27 titled to a payment under the provisions of this paragraph (c) of
28 this subsection.

30 cial purpose taxing district is any taxing district that is not a
31 city, a county, or a school district.

33 under the provisions of this subsection only for the purposes for
34 which the special purpose taxing districts were formed.

36 of 2001, for annual distribution to counties and other taxing districts be-
37 ginning in October 2001 for replacement of property tax on farm machinery and
38 equipment exempted pursuant to section 63-602EE, Idaho Code. For nonschool
39 districts, the state tax commission shall distribute one-fourth (1/4) of
40 this amount certified quarterly to each county. For school districts, the
41 state tax commission shall distribute one-fourth (1/4) of the amount cer-
42 tified quarterly to each school district. For nonschool districts, the
43 county auditor shall distribute such amounts to each district within thirty
44 (30) calendar days from receipt of moneys from the state tax commission.
45 Moneys received by each taxing district for replacement shall be utilized
46 in the same manner and in the same proportions as revenues from property
47 taxation. The moneys remitted to the county treasurer for replacement of
48 property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602EE, Idaho Code, may
49 be considered by the counties and other taxing districts and budgeted at the
50 same time, in the same manner, and in the same year as revenues from taxation
6
1 on personal property, which these moneys replace. If taxing districts are
2 consolidated, the resulting district is entitled to an amount equal to the
3 sum of the amounts received in the last calendar quarter by each district
4 pursuant to this subsection prior to the consolidation. If a taxing district
5 is dissolved or disincorporated, the state tax commission shall continu-
6 ously distribute to the board of county commissioners an amount equal to the
7 last quarter's distribution prior to dissolution or disincorporation. The
8 board of county commissioners shall determine any redistribution of moneys
9 so received. If a taxing district annexes territory, the distribution of
10 moneys received pursuant to this subsection shall be unaffected. Taxing
11 districts formed after January 1, 2001, are not entitled to a payment under
12 the provisions of this subsection. School districts shall receive an amount
13 determined by multiplying the sum of the year 2000 school district levy mi-
14 nus .004 times the market value on December 31, 2000, in the district of the
15 property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602EE, Idaho Code, pro-
16 vided that the result of these calculations shall not be less than zero (0).
17 The result of these school district calculations shall be further increased
18 by six percent (6%). For purposes of the limitation provided by section
19 63-802, Idaho Code, moneys received pursuant to this section as property tax
20 replacement for property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602EE,
21 Idaho Code, shall be treated as property tax revenues.

23 Idaho Code, to a developer of a retail complex shall be remitted to the demon-
24 stration pilot project fund created in section 63-3641, Idaho Code.

26 Code, for annual distribution to counties and other taxing districts for
27 replacement of property tax on personal property tax exemptions pursuant
28 to section 63-602KK(2), Idaho Code, which amounts are continuously ap-
29 propriated unless the legislature enacts a different appropriation for a
30 particular fiscal year. For purposes of the limitation provided by section
31 63-802, Idaho Code, moneys received pursuant to this section as property tax
32 replacement for property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602KK,
33 Idaho Code, shall be treated as property tax revenues. If taxing districts
34 are consolidated, the resulting district is entitled to an amount equal to
35 the sum of the amounts that were received in the last calendar year by each
36 district pursuant to this subsection prior to the consolidation. If a taxing
37 district or revenue allocation area annexes territory, the distribution of
38 moneys received pursuant to this subsection shall be unaffected. Taxing
39 districts and revenue allocation areas formed after January 1, 2022, are not
40 entitled to a payment under the provisions of this subsection.
41 (14) For fiscal year 2023 only, a sum of thirty-four million dollars
42 ($34,000,000) shall be distributed each year by the state tax commission to
43 the forty-four (44) counties in the proportion that the expenditures of each
44 county for indigent defense services during county fiscal year 2021, exclud-
45 ing any state funding or grants, bear to the expenditures of all counties
46 in the state for indigent defense services during county fiscal year 2021,
47 excluding any state funding or grants. No later than July 1, 2022, the state
48 public defense commission shall certify to the state tax commission each

4 in the state treasury, and the moneys in the revenue-sharing account will be
5 paid in installments each calendar quarter by the state tax commission as
6 follows:
7 (a) Forty-five and two-tenths percent (45.2%) shall be paid to the var-
8 ious cities as follows:
9 (i) The revenue-sharing amount calculated by the state tax com-
10 mission for the various cities for each quarter of fiscal year 2020
11 shall be the base amount for current quarterly revenue distribu-
12 tion amounts. The state tax commission shall calculate the per
13 capita distribution for each city resulting from the previous fis-
14 cal year's distributions.
15 (ii) If there is no change in the amount of the revenue-sharing
16 account from the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, then the
17 various cities shall receive the same amount received for the same
18 quarter of the previous fiscal year.
19 (iii) If the balance of the revenue-sharing account for the cur-
20 rent quarter is greater than the balance of the revenue-sharing
21 account for the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, then:
22 1. If the distributions made to the cities during the same
23 quarter of the previous fiscal year were below the base
24 amount established in fiscal year 2020, then the various
25 cities shall first receive a proportional increase up to the
26 base amount for each city and up to a one-percent (1%) in-
27 crease over such base amount. Any remaining moneys shall be
28 distributed to cities with a below-average per capita dis-
29 tribution in the proportion that the population of that city
30 bears to the population of all cities with below-average per
31 capita distributions within the state.
32 2. If the distributions made to the cities during the same
33 quarter of the previous fiscal year were at or above the
34 base amount established in fiscal year 2020, then the cities
35 shall receive the same distribution they received during the
36 same quarter of the previous fiscal year plus a proportional
37 increase up to one percent (1%). Any remaining moneys shall
38 be distributed to the cities with a below-average per capita
39 distribution in the proportion that the population of that
40 city bears to the population of all cities with a below-aver-
41 age per capita distribution within the state.
42 (iv) If the balance of the revenue-sharing account for the cur-
43 rent quarter is less than the balance of the revenue-sharing ac-
44 count for the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, then the
45 cities shall first receive a proportional reduction down to the
46 base amount established in fiscal year 2020. If further reduc-
47 tions are necessary, the cities shall receive reductions based on
48 the proportion that each city's population bears to the population
49 of all cities within the state.

4
1 (b) Forty-seven and one-tenth percent (47.1%) shall be paid to the var-
2 ious counties as follows:
3 (i) Fifty-nine and eight-tenths percent (59.8%) of the amount to
4 be distributed under this paragraph (b) of this subsection shall
5 be distributed as follows:
6 1. One million three hundred twenty thousand dollars
7 ($1,320,000) annually shall be distributed one forty-fourth
8 (1/44) to each of the various counties; and
9 2. The balance of such amount shall be paid to the various
10 counties, and each county shall be entitled to an amount in
11 the proportion that the population of that county bears to
12 the population of the state; and
13 (ii) Forty and two-tenths percent (40.2%) of the amount to be dis-
14 tributed under this paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be dis-
15 tributed as follows:
16 1. Each county that received a payment under the provisions
17 of section 63-3638(e), Idaho Code, as that subsection ex-
18 isted immediately prior to July 1, 2000, during the fourth
19 quarter of calendar year 1999, shall be entitled to a like
20 amount during succeeding calendar quarters.
21 2. If the dollar amount of money available under this sub-
22 section (10)(b)(ii) in any quarter does not equal the amount
23 paid in the fourth quarter of calendar year 1999, each
24 county's payment shall be reduced proportionately.
25 3. If the dollar amount of money available under this sub-
26 section (10)(b)(ii) in any quarter exceeds the amount paid
27 in the fourth quarter of calendar year 1999, each county
28 shall be entitled to a proportionately increased payment,
29 but such increase shall not exceed one hundred five percent
30 (105%) of the total payment made in the fourth quarter of
31 calendar year 1999.
32 4. If the dollar amount of money available under this sub-
33 section (10)(b)(ii) in any quarter exceeds one hundred five
34 percent (105%) of the total payment made in the fourth quar-
35 ter of calendar year 1999, any amount over and above such
36 one hundred five percent (105%) shall be paid to the various
37 counties in the proportion that the population of the county
38 bears to the population of the state; and
39 (c) Seven and seven-tenths percent (7.7%) of the amount appropriated in
40 this subsection shall be paid to the several counties for distribution
41 to special purpose taxing districts as follows:
42 (i) Each such district that received a payment under the provi-
43 sions of section 63-3638(e), Idaho Code, as such subsection ex-
44 isted immediately prior to July 1, 2000, during the fourth quarter
45 of calendar year 1999, shall be entitled to a like amount during
46 succeeding calendar quarters.
47 (ii) If the dollar amount of money available under this subsec-
48 tion (10)(c) in any quarter does not equal the amount paid in the
49 fourth quarter of calendar year 1999, each special purpose taxing
50 district's payment shall be reduced proportionately.

5
1 (iii) If the dollar amount of money available under this subsec-
2 tion (10)(c) in any quarter exceeds the amount distributed under
3 paragraph (c)(i) of this subsection, each special purpose taxing
4 district shall be entitled to a share of the excess based on the
5 proportion each such district's current property tax budget bears
6 to the sum of the current property tax budgets of all such dis-
7 tricts in the state. Each year, starting with the distribution
8 for the quarter ending December 31, the state tax commission shall
9 calculate this distribution based on the district's current prop-
10 erty tax budgets, including any unrecovered forgone amounts as de-
11 termined under section 63-802(1)(e), Idaho Code. When a special
12 purpose taxing district is situated in more than one (1) county,
13 the state tax commission shall determine the portion attributable
14 to the special purpose taxing district from each county in which it
15 is situated.
16 (iv) If special purpose taxing districts are consolidated, the
17 resulting district is entitled to a base amount equal to the sum of
18 the base amounts received in the last calendar quarter by each dis-
19 trict prior to the consolidation.
20 (v) If a special purpose taxing district is dissolved or disin-
21 corporated, the state tax commission shall continuously distrib-
22 ute to the board of county commissioners an amount equal to the
23 last quarter's distribution prior to dissolution or disincorpora-
24 tion. The board of county commissioners shall determine any re-
25 distribution of moneys so received.
26 (vi) Taxing districts formed after January 1, 2001, are not en-
27 titled to a payment under the provisions of this paragraph (c) of
28 this subsection.
29 (vii) For purposes of this paragraph (c) of this subsection, a spe-
30 cial purpose taxing district is any taxing district that is not a
31 city, a county, or a school district.
32 (viii) Special purpose taxing districts shall use funds received
33 under the provisions of this subsection only for the purposes for
34 which the special purpose taxing districts were formed.
35 (11) Amounts calculated in accordance with section 2, chapter 356, laws
36 of 2001, for annual distribution to counties and other taxing districts be-
37 ginning in October 2001 for replacement of property tax on farm machinery and
38 equipment exempted pursuant to section 63-602EE, Idaho Code. For nonschool
39 districts, the state tax commission shall distribute one-fourth (1/4) of
40 this amount certified quarterly to each county. For school districts, the
41 state tax commission shall distribute one-fourth (1/4) of the amount cer-
42 tified quarterly to each school district. For nonschool districts, the
43 county auditor shall distribute such amounts to each district within thirty
44 (30) calendar days from receipt of moneys from the state tax commission.
45 Moneys received by each taxing district for replacement shall be utilized
46 in the same manner and in the same proportions as revenues from property
47 taxation. The moneys remitted to the county treasurer for replacement of
48 property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602EE, Idaho Code, may
49 be considered by the counties and other taxing districts and budgeted at the
50 same time, in the same manner, and in the same year as revenues from taxation

6
1 on personal property, which these moneys replace. If taxing districts are
2 consolidated, the resulting district is entitled to an amount equal to the
3 sum of the amounts received in the last calendar quarter by each district
4 pursuant to this subsection prior to the consolidation. If a taxing district
5 is dissolved or disincorporated, the state tax commission shall continu-
6 ously distribute to the board of county commissioners an amount equal to the
7 last quarter's distribution prior to dissolution or disincorporation. The
8 board of county commissioners shall determine any redistribution of moneys
9 so received. If a taxing district annexes territory, the distribution of
10 moneys received pursuant to this subsection shall be unaffected. Taxing
11 districts formed after January 1, 2001, are not entitled to a payment under
12 the provisions of this subsection. School districts shall receive an amount
13 determined by multiplying the sum of the year 2000 school district levy mi-
14 nus .004 times the market value on December 31, 2000, in the district of the
15 property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602EE, Idaho Code, pro-
16 vided that the result of these calculations shall not be less than zero (0).
17 The result of these school district calculations shall be further increased
18 by six percent (6%). For purposes of the limitation provided by section
19 63-802, Idaho Code, moneys received pursuant to this section as property tax
20 replacement for property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602EE,
21 Idaho Code, shall be treated as property tax revenues.
22 (12) Amounts necessary to pay refunds as provided in section 63-3641,
23 Idaho Code, to a developer of a retail complex shall be remitted to the demon-
24 stration pilot project fund created in section 63-3641, Idaho Code.
25 (13) Amounts calculated in accordance with section 63-602KK(4), Idaho
26 Code, for annual distribution to counties and other taxing districts for
27 replacement of property tax on personal property tax exemptions pursuant
28 to section 63-602KK(2), Idaho Code, which amounts are continuously ap-
29 propriated unless the legislature enacts a different appropriation for a
30 particular fiscal year. For purposes of the limitation provided by section
31 63-802, Idaho Code, moneys received pursuant to this section as property tax
32 replacement for property exempt from taxation pursuant to section 63-602KK,
33 Idaho Code, shall be treated as property tax revenues. If taxing districts
34 are consolidated, the resulting district is entitled to an amount equal to
35 the sum of the amounts that were received in the last calendar year by each
36 district pursuant to this subsection prior to the consolidation. If a taxing
37 district or revenue allocation area annexes territory, the distribution of
38 moneys received pursuant to this subsection shall be unaffected. Taxing
39 districts and revenue allocation areas formed after January 1, 2022, are not
40 entitled to a payment under the provisions of this subsection.
41 (14) For fiscal year 2023 only, a sum of thirty-four million dollars
42 ($34,000,000) shall be distributed each year by the state tax commission to
43 the forty-four (44) counties in the proportion that the expenditures of each
