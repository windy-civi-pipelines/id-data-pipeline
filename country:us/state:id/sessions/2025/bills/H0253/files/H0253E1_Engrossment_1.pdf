2 right to examine and take a copy of any public record of this state and there
3 is a presumption that all public records in Idaho are open at all reasonable
4 times for inspection except as otherwise expressly provided by statute.
5 (2) The right to copy public records shall include the right to make
6 photographs or photographic or other copies while the records are in the pos-
7 session of the custodian of the records using equipment provided by the pub-
8 lic agency or using equipment designated by the custodian.
9 (3) Additionally, the custodian of any public record shall give the
10 person, on demand, a certified copy of it if the record is of a nature permit-
11 ting such copying or shall furnish reasonable opportunity to inspect or copy
12 such record.
13 (4) A public agency may require that a request for public records be
14 submitted to it in a writing that specifically describes the subject mat-
15 ter and records sought, including a specific date range for when the records
16 sought were created. The requesting party shall be as specific as possible
17 when requesting records. A request shall describe records sought in suffi-
18 cient detail to enable the public body to locate such records with reasonable
19 effort. A request shall also provide the requester's name, mailing address,
20 e-mail email address, and telephone number, and a written declaration by the
21 requesting party attesting or affirming under oath whether such requester is
22 a resident. A request for public records and delivery of the public records
23 may be made by electronic mail.
24 (5) The custodian shall make no inquiry of any person who requests a
25 public record, except:
26 (a) To verify the identity of the requester in accordance with section
27 74-113, Idaho Code; or
28 (b) To ensure that the requested record or information will not be
29 used for purposes of a mailing or telephone list prohibited by section
30 74-120, Idaho Code, or as otherwise provided by law; or
31 (c) As required for purposes of protecting personal information from
32 disclosure under chapter 2, title 49, Idaho Code, and federal law.
33 (6) The custodian shall not review, examine or scrutinize any copy,
34 photograph or memoranda in the possession of any such person and shall extend
35 to the person all reasonable comfort and facility for the full exercise of
36 the right granted under this act.
37 (7) Nothing herein contained shall prevent the custodian from main-
38 taining such vigilance as is required to prevent alteration of any public
39 record while it is being examined.
40 (8) Examination of public records under the authority of this section
41 must be conducted during regular office or working hours unless the custo-
42 dian shall authorize examination of records in other than regular office or
43 working hours. In this event, the persons designated to represent the cus-
44 todian during such examination shall be entitled to reasonable compensation
45 to be paid to them by the public agency having custody of such records, out of
46 funds provided in advance by the person examining such records, at other than
47 regular office or working hours.
48 (9) The public agency may provide the requester information to help the
49 requester narrow the scope of the request or to help the requester make the

4
1 request more specific when the response to the request is likely to be volu-
2 minous or require payment as provided in subsection (10) of this section.
3 (10)(a) Except for fees that are authorized or prescribed under other
4 provisions of Idaho law, no fee shall be charged for the first two (2)
5 hours of labor in responding to a request submitted by a resident for
6 public records, or for copying the first one hundred (100) pages of pa-
7 per records that are requested by a resident.
8 (b) A public agency or public official may establish fees to recover
9 the actual labor and copying costs associated with locating and copying
10 documents if:
11 (i) The request is for more than one hundred (100) pages of paper
12 records; or
13 (ii) The request includes records from which nonpublic informa-
14 tion must be deleted; or
15 (iii) The actual labor associated with responding to requests for
16 public records in compliance with the provisions of this chapter
17 exceeds two (2) person hours.
18 (c) A public agency or public official may establish a separate copying
19 fee schedule schedules for requests submitted by residents and requests
20 submitted by persons who are not residents. The fee for residents may
21 not exceed the actual cost to the agency of copying the record if another
22 fee is not otherwise provided by law.
23 (d)(i) For providing a duplicate of a computer tape, computer
24 disc, microfilm or similar or analogous record system containing
25 public record information, a public agency or public official may
26 charge a fee, uniform to all persons residents, that does not ex-
27 ceed the sum of the following:
28 (i) 1. The agency's direct cost of copying the information
29 in that form;
30 (ii) 2. The standard cost, if any, for selling the same in-
31 formation in the form of a publication;
32 (iii) 3. The agency's cost of conversion, or the cost of con-
33 version charged by a third party, if the existing electronic
34 record is converted to another electronic form.
35 (ii) A public agency or public official may charge additional
36 fees, uniform to all persons who are not residents, for requests
37 involving duplication of a computer tape, computer disc, mi-
38 crofilm or similar or analogous record system containing public
39 record information.
40 (e) Fees for requests made by residents shall not exceed reasonable
41 labor costs necessarily incurred in responding to a public records
42 request. Fees, and if charged, shall reflect the personnel and quan-
43 tity of time that are reasonably necessary to process a request. Fees
44 for requests made by residents for labor costs shall be charged at the
45 per hour pay rate of the lowest paid administrative staff employee or
46 public official of the public agency who is necessary and qualified to
47 process the request. If a request from a resident requires redactions
48 to be made by an attorney who is employed by the public agency, the rate
49 charged shall be no more than the per hour rate of the lowest paid attor-
50 ney within the public agency who is necessary and qualified to process

5
1 the public records request. If a request from a resident is submitted
2 to a public agency that does not have an attorney on staff, and requires
3 redactions by an attorney, the rate shall be no more than the usual and
4 customary rate of the attorney who is retained by the public agency for
5 that purpose.
6 (f) The public agency shall not charge any cost or fee for copies or
7 labor when the requester is a resident and demonstrates that the re-
8 quester's examination and/or copying of public records:
9 (i) Is likely to contribute significantly to the public's under-
10 standing of the operations or activities of the government;
11 (ii) Is not primarily in the individual interest of the requester
12 including, but not limited to, the requester's interest in litiga-
13 tion in which the requester is or may become a party; and
14 (iii) Will not occur if fees are charged because the requester has
15 insufficient financial resources to pay such fees.
16 (g) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a public
17 agency or public official may charge fees for labor and copying costs
18 associated with locating and copying documents requested by a person
19 who is not a resident or an employee of a resident. The fee rates and
20 schedule for requests made by persons who are not residents or employees
21 of residents shall be at the discretion of the public agency or public
22 official as long as such fees do not exceed actual costs of the public
23 agency or public official.
24 (g) (h) Statements of fees by a public agency shall be itemized to show
25 the per page costs for copies, and hourly rates of employees and attor-
26 neys involved in responding to the request, and the actual time spent on
27 the public records request. No lump sum costs shall be assigned to any
28 public records request. If a separate fee schedule is adopted for re-
29 quests from persons who are not residents or employees of residents, the
30 separate fees for such nonresidents shall be separately identified.
31 (11) A requester may not file multiple requests for public records
32 solely to avoid payment of fees. When a public agency reasonably believes
33 that one (1) or more requesters is segregating a request into a series of
34 requests to avoid payment of fees authorized pursuant to this section, the
35 public agency may aggregate such requests and charge the appropriate fees.
36 The public agency may consider the time period in which the requests have
37 been made in its determination to aggregate the related requests. A public
38 agency shall not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one
39 (1) requester.
40 (12) The custodian may require advance payment of fees authorized by
41 this section. Any money received by the public agency shall be credited to
42 the account for which the expense being reimbursed was or will be charged,
43 and such funds may be expended by the agency as part of its appropriation from
44 that fund. Any portion of an advance payment in excess of the actual costs of
45 labor and copying incurred by the agency in responding to the request shall
46 be returned to the requester.
47 (13) A public agency shall not prevent the examination or copying of a
48 public record by contracting with a nongovernmental body to perform any of
49 its duties or functions.

6
1 (14) Nothing contained herein shall prevent a public agency from dis-
2 closing statistical information that is descriptive of an identifiable per-
3 son or persons, unless prohibited by law.
4 (15) Nothing contained herein shall prevent a public agency from pro-
5 viding a copy of a public record in electronic form if the record is available
6 in electronic form and if the person specifically requests an electronic
7 copy.
8 (16) A public agency or elected official shall designate a custodian or
9 custodians for all public records, which includes any public official having
10 custody of, control of, or authorized access to public records and also in-
11 cludes all delegates of such officials, employees or representatives.
12 SECTION 3. That Section 74-103, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
13 amended to read as follows:
14 74-103. REQUEST AND RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR EXAMINATION OF PUBLIC

16 designated custodian of such records as defined in section 74-101(3), Idaho
17 Code. A public agency, a public official, or an employee of a public agency
18 shall have no obligation and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obli-
19 gation to respond to a public records request that fails to comply with the
20 requirements of this subsection. A public records request must clearly in-
21 dicate that it is a public records request.
22 (2) A public agency or custodian shall either grant or deny a person's a
23 resident's request to examine or copy public records within three (3) work-
24 ing days of the date of the receipt of the request for examination or copy-
25 ing. A public agency or custodian shall either grant or deny a request from
26 a person who is not a resident and not employed by a resident to examine or
27 copy public records within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the receipt
28 of the request for examination or copying. If it is determined by employees
29 of the public agency that a longer period of time is needed to locate or re-
30 trieve the public records, the public agency shall so notify in writing the
31 person requesting to examine or copy the records and shall provide the public
32 records no later than ten (10) working days following the person's request,
33 if such person is an Idaho a resident, and no later than twenty-one (21) work-
34 ing thirty-five (35) days following a request from a nonresident. Provided
35 however, if Additionally, if it is determined that the existing electronic
36 record requested will first have to be converted to another electronic for-
37 mat by the agency or by a third party and that such conversion cannot be com-
38 pleted within ten (10) working days the time allotted for the response, the
39 agency shall so notify in writing the person requesting to examine or copy
40 the records. The agency shall provide the converted public record at a time
41 mutually agreed upon between the agency and the requester, with due consid-
42 eration given to any limitations that may exist due to the process of conver-
43 sion or due to the use of a third party to make the conversion.
44 (3) If the public agency or custodian fails to respond within the time
45 allotted for the response, the request shall be deemed to be denied within
46 ten (10) working days following the request.
47 (4) If the public agency denies the person's request for examination
48 or copying the public records or denies in part and grants in part the per-
49 son's request for examination and copying of the public records, the person

7
1 legally responsible for administering the public agency or that person's de-
2 signee shall notify the person in writing of the denial or partial denial of
3 the request for the public record.
4 (5) The notice of denial or partial denial shall state that the attorney
5 for the public agency has reviewed the request or shall state that the public
6 agency has had an opportunity to consult with an attorney regarding the re-
7 quest for examination or copying of a record and has chosen not to do so. The
8 notice of denial or partial denial also shall indicate the statutory author-
9 ity for the denial and indicate clearly the person's right to appeal the de-
10 nial or partial denial and the time periods for doing so.
