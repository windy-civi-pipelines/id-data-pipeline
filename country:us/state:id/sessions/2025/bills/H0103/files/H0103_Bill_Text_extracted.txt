23 property, or immediate financial loss, or the likelihood of such injury,
24 damage or loss, when the notice requirements of this section would make such
25 notice impracticable or increase the likelihood or severity of such injury,
26 damage or loss, and the reason for the emergency is stated at the outset of

41 inal agenda notice, all items known to be probable items of discussion. An
42 agenda item that requires a vote shall be identified on the agenda as an
2
1 "action item" to provide notice that action may be taken on that item. Iden-
2 tifying an item as an action item on the agenda does not require a vote to be
3 taken on that item.
4 (a) If an amendment to an agenda is made after an agenda has been posted
5 but forty-eight (48) hours or more prior to the start of a regular meet-
6 ing, or twenty-four (24) hours or more prior to the start of a special
7 meeting, then the agenda is amended upon the posting of the amended

16 that states the reason for the amendment and states the good faith rea-
17 son the agenda item was not included in the original agenda posting. Fi-
18 nal action may not be taken on an agenda item added after the start of
19 a meeting unless an emergency is declared necessitating action at that
20 meeting. The declaration and justification shall be reflected in the
21 minutes.
22 (d) Any action item containing more than one (1) action or decision,
23 such as in a consent calendar or consent agenda, shall be passed only by
24 unanimous consent with every voting member in agreement. If the vote is
25 not unanimous, then each item shall be voted on separately as individual
26 action items.
27 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
28 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
29 July 1, 2025.
