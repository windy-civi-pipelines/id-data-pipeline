21 mission shall establish and regulate the rates, terms, and conditions, and

23 ity the recovery of not less than all the additional costs of providing and
24 maintaining pole attachments and not more than the associated capital cost
25 and operating expenses of the public utility attributable to that portion of
26 the pole, duct, or conduit used for the pole attachment, including a share
27 of the required support and clearance space. In determining and fixing the
28 rates, terms, and conditions, the commission shall consider the interest of
29 the customers of the attaching provider of the telecommunications service,
30 broadband or cable services company, the public utility on which the attach-
31 ment is made, and the customers of the public utility.
