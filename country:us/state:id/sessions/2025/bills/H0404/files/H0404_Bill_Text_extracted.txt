5 tirely, but may adopt reasonable rules related to the housing and pasturing
6 of chickens, including but not limited to rules regarding manure and odor

22 allow for chicken ownership.

24 to be severable and if any provision of this act or the application of such
25 provision to any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason,
