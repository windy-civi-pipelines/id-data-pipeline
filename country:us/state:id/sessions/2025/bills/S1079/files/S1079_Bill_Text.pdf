7 SECTION 1. That Section 48-305, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
8 amended to read as follows:
9 48-305. FEES AND COSTS FOR EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION ACTION. (1)
10 Notwithstanding any provision of law or agreement to the contrary, a patient
11 shall have no liability to any party taking extraordinary collection action
12 for costs, expenses, and fees, including attorney's fees, unless the party
13 has complied with section 48-304, Idaho Code, and then subject to the follow-
14 ing limitations:
15 (a) In the case of an uncontested judgment against the patient, the
16 court may award, in addition to the outstanding principal, up to three
17 hundred fifty dollars ($350) or an amount equal to one hundred percent
18 (100%) of the outstanding principal amount, whichever is less, plus any
19 prejudgment interest accrued in accordance with section 48-304(1)(d),
20 Idaho Code, and any postjudgment interest awarded by the court;
21 (b) In the case of a contested judgment against the patient, the court
22 may award, in addition to the outstanding principal, up to seven hundred
23 fifty dollars ($750) or an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
24 the outstanding principal amount, whichever is less, plus any prejudg-
25 ment interest accrued in accordance with section 48-304(1)(d), Idaho
26 Code, and any postjudgment interest awarded by the court;
27 (c) In the case of postjudgment motions and writs, the court may award
28 up to seventy-five dollars ($75.00) for any successful motion or ap-
29 plication for a writ of attachment to any particular garnishee and
30 twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for any subsequent application for a writ
31 to the same garnishee. In the case of garnishments, the court may also
32 award service fees as prescribed by the applicable board of county com-
33 missioners pursuant to section 11-729, Idaho Code.
34 (2) In the case of a contested judgment, if a party taking extraordi-
35 nary collection action against a patient prevails against a patient and in-
36 curs costs, expenses, and fees, including attorney's fees, that are grossly
37 disproportionate to the award amounts set forth in subsection (1)(b) of this
38 section, then the party may petition the court for a supplemental award for
39 costs, expenses, and fees. Upon an affirmative showing that the incurred
40 costs, expenses, and fees are grossly disproportionate to the award amounts
41 set forth in subsection (1)(b) of this section, and that fees were incurred
42 because of the patient's willful attempt to avoid paying a bona fide debt,

2
1 then the court may take into account the factors outlined in rule 54(e)(3) of
2 the Idaho rules of civil procedure and may, in its discretion, award supple-
3 mental costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees.
4 (3) Notwithstanding any provision of law or agreement to the contrary,
5 if a patient in a contested judgment is a prevailing party, then the patient
6 shall be entitled to recover from a nonprevailing party all costs, expenses,
7 and fees, including attorney's fees, incurred by the patient in contesting
8 the action, and the patient shall have no liability to any nonprevailing par-
9 ties for any costs, expenses, and fees, including attorney's fees and pre-
10 judgment interest incurred by a nonprevailing party.
11 (4) The limitations on costs, expenses, and fees, including attorney's
12 fees, provided for in this section shall apply to every action, proceeding,
13 or judgment to which this chapter applies and to every action, proceeding, or
14 judgment founded on or derived from such a judgment, including without lim-
15 itation a new cause of action on a judgment, a judgment recovery case, or a
16 judgment sold, transferred, or assigned by the original creditor or judg-
17 ment creditor. The original action and judgment and any subsequent actions
18 or judgments shall be considered a single action or judgment for purposes of
19 computing or applying such limitations.
20 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
21 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
22 July 1, 2025.
