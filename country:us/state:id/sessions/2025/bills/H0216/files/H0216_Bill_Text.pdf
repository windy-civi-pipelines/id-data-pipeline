26 "amended" and shall not contain markings identifying the specific comple-
27 tion or correction. A completed or corrected certificate shall be identi-

4 signed by the husband attesting that he is not the father, and a notarized
5 acknowledgment of paternity signed by the mother and the alleged father
6 attesting that the alleged father is the father, the state registrar shall
7 amend the certificate of birth to show such paternity, and change the child's
8 name, if so requested by the mother and the alleged father. Such certificate

19 tary evidence, and if the deficiencies are not corrected, the state regis-
20 trar shall not amend the vital record and shall advise the applicant of the
21 reason for this action and shall further advise the applicant of the right
22 to petition a court of competent jurisdiction for an order establishing the
23 facts necessary to make the requested amendment.

25 is rescinded pursuant to section 7-1106, Idaho Code, and the certificate of
26 birth had been prepared or amended in accordance with the acknowledgment,
27 the state registrar shall not release any copies of the certificate of birth
28 except as required for a legal proceeding until a court order determining pa-
29 ternity has been provided to the state registrar. If the mother was married
