10
1 canceled, denied, refused or disqualified, the licensee may request
2 in writing on a form prescribed by the department an extension of the
3 driver's license. The request shall be accompanied by the fee fixed in
4 section 49-306, Idaho Code, and the extension shall be no more than a
5 twelve (12) month period. If the department determines that an exten-
6 sion of the driver's license is necessary, it may issue a license show-
7 ing the date to which the expired driver's license is extended. License
8 extensions are limited to two (2) consecutive extensions per licensee.

16 effect upon entering active duty, shall remain in full force and effect and
17 shall, upon application, be extended for a period of four (4) years as long as
18 active duty continues or shall be renewed upon application in person without
19 the requirement to take a knowledge or skills test if the Idaho driver's li-

29 license may be obtained in any twelve (12) month period and may be obtained
30 only twice in a driver's lifetime.
31 (12) A person who applies for renewal of a license may request that the
32 notation "permanently disabled" be imprinted on the license, and the depart-
33 ment shall imprint "permanently disabled" on the license if:
34 (a) The person has a permanent disability;
35 (b) The person presents written certification from a licensed physi-
36 cian, licensed physician assistant, or licensed advanced practice

28 nation contribution fund created in section 49-2447, Idaho Code.
29 (5) Every application shall state the applicant's true and full name,

35 her application pursuant to this section, the applicant's alternative Idaho
36 mailing address in place of his or her Idaho residence address and mail-
37 ing address. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 49-303(13), Idaho
38 Code, an applicant for a nondomiciled class A, B or C driver's license or
39 nondomiciled commercial learner's permit having residency in a state that
40 is prohibited from issuing class A, B or C driver's licenses or commercial
41 learner's permits, as provided in 49 CFR 384, is excepted from providing
42 proof of Idaho residency and an Idaho mailing address.

44 as verified by the social security administration shall apply only to
45 applicants who have been assigned a social security number.
46 (b) An applicant who has not been assigned a social security number
47 shall:
48 (i) Present written verification from the social security admin-
49 istration that the applicant has not been assigned a social secu-
50 rity number; and

6
1 (ii) Submit a birth certificate, passport or other documentary
2 evidence issued by an entity other than a state or the United
3 States; and
4 (iii) Submit such proof as the department may require that the ap-
5 plicant is lawfully present in the United States.
6 A driver's license, commercial learner's permit or any instruction
7 permit issued on and after January 1, 1993, shall not contain an appli-
8 cant's social security number. Applications on file shall be exempt
9 from disclosure except as provided in sections 49-202, 49-203, 49-203A
10 and 49-204, Idaho Code.

15 to operate in interstate commerce and is required to provide a med-
16 ical examiner's certificate;
17 (ii) Excepted interstate. The applicant operates or expects to
18 operate in interstate commerce, but engages exclusively in trans-
19 portation or operations excepted by the federal motor carrier
20 safety administration from all or parts of the qualification re-
21 quirements of federal motor carrier safety regulation 49, part
22 391, and is therefore not required to provide a medical examiner's
23 certificate;
24 (iii) Non-excepted intrastate. The applicant operates only in
25 intrastate commerce and is subject to and meets all Idaho driver
26 qualification requirements and the applicable parts of federal
27 motor carrier safety regulation 49, part 391, and is required to
28 provide a medical examiner's certificate; or
29 (iv) Excepted intrastate. The applicant operates in intrastate
30 commerce, but engages exclusively in exempted transportation or
31 operations as listed in section 67-2901B(2), Idaho Code, and the
32 applicable parts of federal motor carrier safety regulation 49,
33 part 391, and is therefore not required to provide a medical exam-
34 iner's certificate.
35 All applications shall also state whether the applicant has previously
36 been licensed as a driver and, if so, when and by what state or country
37 and whether a driver's license or privileges have ever been suspended,
38 revoked, denied, disqualified, canceled or refused and, if so, the
39 date of and reason for the suspension, revocation, denial, disquali-
40 fication, cancellation or refusal and the applicant's oath that all
41 information is correct as signified by the applicant's signature.
42 (d) The applicant must submit proof of identity and citizenship sta-
43 tus acceptable to the examiner or the department and date of birth as
44 set forth in a certified copy of his birth certificate. When a certified
45 copy of his birth certificate or a delayed birth certificate is impossi-
46 ble to obtain from a vital statistics agency, another government-issued
47 document may be submitted that provides satisfactory evidence of a per-
48 son's full legal name and date of birth acceptable to the examiner or the
49 department.

7
1 (e) Every applicant for a class A, B or C driver's license or commer-
2 cial learner's permit shall provide proof of United States citizenship
3 or lawful permanent residency in the United States upon application for
4 issuance, transfer, upgrade or renewal, unless the applicant's driving
5 record already contains documentation confirming United States citi-
6 zenship or lawful permanent residency. Every applicant for a nondomi-
7 ciled class A, B or C driver's license or commercial learner's permit
8 domiciled in a foreign country must provide an unexpired employment au-
9 thorization document issued by the department of homeland security or

12 (f) Individuals required to register in compliance with section 3 of
13 the federal military selective service act, 50 U.S.C. App. 451 et seq.,
14 as amended, shall be provided an opportunity to fulfill such registra-
15 tion requirements in conjunction with an application for a driver's li-
16 cense, commercial learner's permit or instruction permit. Any regis-
17 tration information so supplied shall be transmitted by the department
18 to the selective service system.
19 (6) Whenever an application is received from a person previously li-
20 censed in another jurisdiction, the department shall request a copy of the
21 driver's record from the other jurisdiction and shall contact the national
22 driver register. When received, the driver's record from the previous ju-
23 risdiction shall become a part of the driver's record in this state with the
24 same force and effect as though entered on the driver's record in this state
25 in the original instance.
26 (7) Whenever the department receives a request for a driver's record
27 from another licensing jurisdiction, the record shall be forwarded without
28 charge.
29 (8) The department shall contact and notify the commercial driver li-
30 cense information system of the proposed application for a class A, B or C
31 driver's license or commercial learner's permit to ensure identification of
32 the person and to obtain clearance to issue the license.
33 (9) The department shall request information from the drug and alco-
34 hol clearinghouse to determine whether an applicant for any class A, B, or C
35 driver's license or commercial learner's permit is eligible for the creden-
36 tial.
37 (10) A contractor administering a class A, B, or C skills test may col-
38 lect an additional fee for the use of the contractor's vehicle for the skills
39 test.

44 require class B or C commercial driver's licenses;

17 49-319. EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL OF DRIVER'S LICENSE. (1) Every noncom-
18 mercial Idaho driver's license issued to a driver shall expire and be renew-
19 able as follows:
20 (a) For drivers twenty-one (21) years of age or older, the driver's li-
21 cense shall expire on the licensee's birthday in the fourth year follow-
22 ing the issuance of the driver's license.
23 (b) At the option of the applicant, for drivers twenty-one (21) years of
24 age through sixty-two (62) years of age, the driver's license shall ex-
25 pire on the licensee's birthday in either the fourth year or the eighth
26 year following the issuance of the driver's license.
27 (c) Except for the provisions found in subsections (1)(e) and (3) of
28 this section, every driver's license issued to a driver under eighteen
29 (18) years of age shall expire five (5) days after the licensee's eigh-
30 teenth birthday.
31 (d) Except for the provisions found in subsections (1)(e) and (3) of
32 this section, every driver's license issued to a driver eighteen (18)
33 years of age but under twenty-one (21) years of age shall expire five (5)
34 days after the licensee's twenty-first birthday.
35 (e) Every driver's license that is not, as provided by law, suspended,
36 revoked or disqualified in this state or any other jurisdiction shall
37 be renewable on or before its expiration, but not more than twenty-five
38 (25) months before, upon application, payment of the required fee, and
39 satisfactory completion of the required vision screening. Notwith-
40 standing the provisions of this section, a person who has had his
41 noncommercial Idaho driver's license suspended may renew his driver's
42 license as provided in this section, which renewal shall be subject to
43 the suspension.
44 (2) Except for the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, at the
45 option of the applicant, every commercial driver's license issued to a per-
46 son twenty-one (21) years of age through sixty-two (62) years of age shall
47 expire on the licensee's birthday in the fourth or eighth year following is-
48 suance of the license. Any class A, B or C license issued to a person eighteen

9
1 (18), nineteen (19) or twenty (20) years of age shall expire five (5) days af-
2 ter the licensee's twenty-first birthday.
3 (3) Every driver's license issued to a person who is not a citizen or
4 permanent legal resident of the United States shall have an expiration date
5 that is the same date as the end of lawful stay in the United States, as
6 indicated on documents issued and verified by the department of homeland
7 security; however, the expiration date shall not extend beyond the expira-
8 tion date for the same category of license issued to citizens. Persons whose
9 department of homeland security documents do not state an expiration date
10 shall be issued a driver's license with an expiration date of one (1) year
11 from the date of issuance. Fees shall be in accordance with the expiration
12 periods and classes listed in section 49-306(1), Idaho Code.
13 (4) An applicant who is issued a driver's license in another jurisdic-
14 tion after an Idaho driver's license has been issued is not eligible for re-
15 newal or a duplicate of the Idaho driver's license. The applicant may apply
16 for a new Idaho driver's license as provided in section 49-306, Idaho Code.
17 (5) No knowledge test shall be required for renewal of a driver's li-
18 cense, except for renewal of a hazardous material endorsement. No knowl-
19 edge test shall be required if an applicant for a new class D Idaho driver's
20 license has previously held an Idaho driver's license. Appropriate knowl-
21 edge and skills tests shall be required for an upgrade in a driver's license
22 class, renewal of a hazardous material endorsement, or an endorsement addi-
23 tion. In the case of a name change, the applicant shall provide legal docu-
24 mentation to verify the change in accordance with department rules.
25 (6) Applicants for a hazardous material endorsement shall provide ei-
26 ther proof of United States citizenship or proof of lawful, permanent United
27 States residence and a valid federal bureau of citizenship and immigration
28 services alien registration number. A security background records check and
29 federal transportation security administration clearance shall be required
30 for issuance, renewal or transfer of a hazardous material endorsement in ac-
31 cordance with 49 CFR 383, subject to procedures established by the federal
32 transportation security administration.
33 (7) When a driver's license has been expired for fewer than twenty-five
34 (25) months, the renewal of the driver's license shall start from the orig-
35 inal date of expiration, regardless of the year in which the application
36 for renewal is made. If the driver's license is expired for twenty-five
37 (25) months or more, the applicant shall be required to take the appropriate
38 knowledge test(s) and skills test(s) for the class of license or endorsement
39 being applied for and undergo vision screening. The license shall expire
40 on the licensee's birthday in the fourth year following issuance of the
41 driver's license for drivers twenty-one (21) years of age or older, except
42 as otherwise provided in subsections (1)(e) and (3) of this section. At the
43 option of the applicant, for drivers twenty-one (21) years of age through
44 sixty-two (62) years of age, the renewed license shall expire on the li-
45 censee's birthday in either the fourth year or the eighth year following
46 issuance, except as otherwise provided in subsections (1)(e) and (3) of this
47 section.
48 (8)(a) If a driver's license has expired or will expire and the licensee
49 is temporarily out of state, except on active military duty, and the
50 driver's license has not, as provided by law, been suspended, revoked,

10
1 canceled, denied, refused or disqualified, the licensee may request
2 in writing on a form prescribed by the department an extension of the
3 driver's license. The request shall be accompanied by the fee fixed in
4 section 49-306, Idaho Code, and the extension shall be no more than a
5 twelve (12) month period. If the department determines that an exten-
6 sion of the driver's license is necessary, it may issue a license show-
7 ing the date to which the expired driver's license is extended. License
8 extensions are limited to two (2) consecutive extensions per licensee.
9 (b) Upon returning to the state of Idaho, the licensee shall, within ten
10 (10) days, apply for a renewal of the expired driver's license and sur-
11 render the extended license and the expired driver's license.
12 (c) A hazardous material endorsement cannot be extended.
13 (9) An Idaho driver's license issued to any person prior to serving on
14 active duty in the armed forces of the United States, or a member of the im-
15 mediate family accompanying such a person, if valid and in full force and
16 effect upon entering active duty, shall remain in full force and effect and
17 shall, upon application, be extended for a period of four (4) years as long as
18 active duty continues or shall be renewed upon application in person without
19 the requirement to take a knowledge or skills test if the Idaho driver's li-
20 cense expired while on active duty, if the driver's license is not suspended,
21 denied, disqualified, canceled or revoked, as provided by law, during the
22 active duty, and the driver's license shall remain in full force and effect
23 sixty (60) days following the date the holder is released from active duty.
24 (10) The department may use a mail or electronic renewal process for
25 class D and commercial driver's licenses based on criteria established by
26 rule.
27 (11) A seasonal driver's license is valid only for a one-hundred-eighty
28 (180) day period from the date of issuance. Only one (1) seasonal driver's
29 license may be obtained in any twelve (12) month period and may be obtained
30 only twice in a driver's lifetime.
31 (12) A person who applies for renewal of a license may request that the
32 notation "permanently disabled" be imprinted on the license, and the depart-
33 ment shall imprint "permanently disabled" on the license if:
34 (a) The person has a permanent disability;
35 (b) The person presents written certification from a licensed physi-
36 cian, licensed physician assistant, or licensed advanced practice
37 professional nurse verifying that the person's stated impairment qual-
38 ifies as a permanent disability as provided in section 49-117, Idaho
39 Code; and
40 (c) The department determines that the person meets the requirements
41 for issuance of a license as specified in section 49-313, Idaho Code.
42 SECTION 4. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
43 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
44 July 1, 2025.
