19 an individual's speech or conduct that has been created through the use
20 of generative adversarial network techniques or other digital technol-
21 ogy in a manner to create a realistic but false audio or video that:
22 (i) Appears to a reasonable individual to be of a real event, ac-
23 tion, or speech that did not actually occur in reality; and
24 (ii) Provides a fundamentally different understanding or impres-
25 sion of the event, action, or speech than a reasonable person would
26 have from the unaltered, original version of the audio recording
27 or video recording.
28 (3) A candidate whose action or speech is deceptively represented
29 through the use of synthetic media in an electioneering communication, ex-
30 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure may seek injunctive or
31 other equitable relief prohibiting the publication of such synthetic media.
32 (4) A candidate whose action or speech is deceptively represented
33 through the use of synthetic media in an electioneering communication, ex-
34 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure may bring an action for
35 general damages, special damages, or both against the information content
36 provider. The court may also award a prevailing party reasonable attorney's
37 fees and costs. The provisions of this subsection do not limit or preclude a
38 plaintiff from securing or recovering any other available remedy.

40 to this section that the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
41 candidate, or independent expenditure containing synthetic media includes
42 a disclosure stating, "This (video/audio) has been manipulated" in the fol-
43 lowing manner:
44 (a) If the media is a video, the text of the disclosure must be promi-
45 nently displayed and appear in a size easily readable by the average
46 viewer, and the disclosure must appear for the duration of the video; or
47 (b) If the media consists of audio only, the disclosure must be read in
48 a clearly spoken manner and in a pitch that can be easily heard by the
49 average listener at the beginning of the audio, at the end of the au-
15
1 dio, and, if the audio is greater than two (2) minutes in length, in-
2 terspersed within the audio at intervals of no more than two (2) minutes
3 each.
4 (6) In any action commenced pursuant to this section, the plaintiff
5 bears the burden of establishing the use of synthetic media by clear and
6 convincing evidence.
7 (7) Courts are encouraged to determine matters pursuant to this section
8 expediently.
9 (8) For an action brought pursuant to this section, the information
10 content provider of the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
11 candidate, or independent expenditure may be held liable and not the medium
12 disseminating the electioneering communication, expenditure by a candi-
13 date, or independent expenditure except as provided in subsection (9) of
14 this section.
15 (9) Except when a licensee, programmer, or operator of a federally li-
16 censed broadcasting station transmits an electioneering communication, ex-
17 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure that is subject to 47
18 U.S.C. 315, a medium may be held liable in a cause of action brought pursuant
19 to this section if:
20 (a) The medium removes any disclosure described in subsection (5) of
21 this section from the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
22 candidate, or independent expenditure it disseminates; or
23 (b) Subject to affirmative defenses described in this section, the
24 medium changes the content of an electioneering communication, ex-
25 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure such that it
26 qualifies as synthetic media.
27 (10) No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be
28 treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another
29 information content provider. However, an interactive computer service may
30 be held liable in accordance with subsection (9) of this section.

42 exercise the powers hereunder by a board of commissioners to be established
43 as follows:
44 (a) Unless provided otherwise in this section, the mayor, by and with
45 the advice and consent of the local governing body, shall appoint a
46 board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency, which shall consist
47 of not less than three (3) commissioners nor more than nine (9) commis-
37
1 sioners. In the order of appointment, the mayor shall designate the
2 number of commissioners to be appointed, and the term of each, provided
3 that the original term of office of no more than two (2) commissioners
4 shall expire in the same year. The commissioners shall serve for terms
5 not to exceed five (5) years, from the date of appointment, except that
6 all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term.
7 (b) For inefficiency or neglect of duty or misconduct in office, a com-
8 missioner may be removed by a majority vote of the local governing body
9 only after a hearing and after he shall have been given a copy of the
10 charges at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing and have had an op-
11 portunity to be heard in person or by counsel. Any commission position
12 that becomes vacant at a time other than the expiration of a term shall
13 be filled by the mayor or chair of the board of county commissioners, if
14 that is the local governing body, by and with the advice and consent of
15 the local governing body, including the mayor, if applicable, and shall
16 be filled for the unexpired term.
17 (c) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may appoint
18 and designate, from among its members, members of the board of commis-
19 sioners of the urban renewal agency, provided that such representation
20 shall be less than a majority of the board of commissioners of the urban
21 renewal agency of the members of the local governing body on and after
22 July 1, 2017, in which case all the rights, powers, duties, privileges,
23 and immunities vested by the urban renewal law of 1965, and as amended,
24 in an appointed board of commissioners, shall be vested in the local
25 governing body, which shall, in all respects when acting as an urban re-
26 newal agency, be acting as an arm of state government, entirely separate
27 and distinct from the municipality, to achieve, perform, and accomplish
28 the public purposes prescribed and provided by said urban renewal law of
29 1965, and as amended.
30 (d) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may termi-
31 nate the appointed board of commissioners and thereby appoint and des-
32 ignate itself as the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency
33 for not more than one (1) calendar year.
34 (e) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may provide
35 that the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency shall be
36 elected at an election held for such purpose on one (1) of the November
37 dates provided in section 34-106, Idaho Code, and the ordinance may pro-
38 vide term limits for the commissioners. In this case, all the rights,
39 powers, duties, privileges, and immunities vested by the urban renewal
40 law of 1965, and as amended, in an appointed board of commissioners,
41 shall be vested in the elected board of commissioners of the urban
42 renewal agency, which shall, in all respects when acting as an urban re-
43 newal agency, be acting as an arm of state government, entirely separate
44 and distinct from the municipality, to achieve, perform, and accomplish
45 the public purposes prescribed and provided by said urban renewal law
46 of 1965, and as amended. The provisions of chapter 66, title 67 3, title
47 74, Idaho Code, shall apply to elected commissioners, and the county
48 election law shall apply to the person running for commissioner as if
49 the person were running for county commissioner. In the event of a
50 vacancy in an elected commissioner position, the replacement shall be
38
1 appointed by the mayor or chair of the board of county commissioners, if
2 that is the local governing body, by and with the advice and consent of
3 the local governing body, and shall be filled for the unexpired term.
4 (3) In all instances, a member of the board of commissioners of the ur-
5 ban renewal agency must be a resident of the county where the urban renewal
6 agency is located or is doing business.
7 (4) A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his services but
8 shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including travel expenses, in-
9 curred in the discharge of his duties. Each commissioner shall hold office
10 until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of
11 the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the
12 clerk of the municipality and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence
13 of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner.
14 (5)(a) The powers of an urban renewal agency shall be exercised by the
15 commissioners thereof. A majority of the commissioners shall consti-
16 tute a quorum for the purpose of conducting business and exercising the
17 powers of the agency and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by
18 the agency upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, un-
19 less in any case the bylaws shall require a larger number.
20 (b) The commissioners shall elect the chairman, cochairman, or vice
21 chairman for a term of one (1) year from among their members. An agency
22 may employ an executive director, technical experts, and such other
23 agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and
24 determine their qualifications, duties, and compensation. For such
25 legal service as it may require, an agency may employ or retain its own
26 counsel and legal staff.
27 (c) An agency authorized to transact business and exercise powers un-
28 der this chapter shall file, with the local governing body, on or be-
29 fore March 31 of each year a report of its activities for the preced-
30 ing calendar year, which report shall include the financial data and au-
31 dit reports required under sections 67-1075 and 67-1076, Idaho Code.
32 The agency shall be required to hold a public meeting to report these
33 findings and take comments from the public. At the time of filing the
34 report, the agency shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation
35 in the community a notice to the effect that such report has been filed
36 with the municipality and the state controller and that the report is
37 available for inspection during business hours in the office of the city
38 clerk or county recorder, in the office of the agency, and at all times
39 on the website of the state controller.
40 (d) An urban renewal agency shall have the same fiscal year as a mu-
41 nicipality and shall be subject to the same audit requirements as a mu-
42 nicipality. An urban renewal agency shall be required to prepare and
43 file with its local governing body an annual financial report and shall
44 prepare, approve, and adopt an annual budget for filing with the local
45 governing body, for informational purposes. A budget means an annual
46 estimate of revenues and expenses for the following fiscal year of the
47 agency.
48 (6) An urban renewal agency shall comply with the public records law
49 pursuant to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, open meetings law pursuant to
50 chapter 2, title 74, Idaho Code, the ethics in government law pursuant to
39
1 chapter 4, title 74, Idaho Code, and the competitive bidding provisions of
2 chapter 28, title 67, Idaho Code.
3 (7) Upon dissolution of the urban renewal agency, title to all property
4 of the urban renewal agency shall revert to the municipality.

29 PROVISIONS OF GENERAL APPLICATION
30 74-3-101. PURPOSE OF CHAPTER. The purpose of this chapter is:
31 (1) To promote openness and public confidence in government; and
32 (2) To promote transparency by those giving financial support to elec-
33 tion campaigns and to persons advocating for or against candidates or ballot
34 measures.
35 74-3-102. DEFINITIONS. As used in this chapter, the following terms
36 have the following meanings:
37 (1) "Candidate" means an individual who seeks nomination, election,
38 or reelection to public office in Idaho and includes individuals seeking
39 statewide, judicial, legislative, or local government office. For the
40 purposes of this chapter, "candidate" does not include individuals seeking
41 nomination, election, or reelection to federal office.
42 (2) "Contribution" includes any advance, conveyance, forgiveness of
43 indebtedness, deposit, distribution, loan, payment, gift, pledge, sub-
44 scription or transfer of money or anything of value, and any contract,

3
1 agreement, and promise or other obligation, whether or not legally enforce-
2 able, to make a contribution in support of or in opposition to any candidate,
3 political action committee, or measure. Such term also includes personal
4 funds or other property of a candidate or members of his household expended
5 or transferred to cover expenditures incurred in support of such candidate
6 but does not include personal funds used to pay the candidate filing fee.
7 Such term also includes the rendering of personal and professional ser-
8 vices for less than full consideration, but does not include ordinary home
9 hospitality or the rendering of "part-time" personal services of the sort
10 commonly performed by volunteer campaign workers or advisors or inciden-
11 tal expenses not in excess of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) personally paid
12 for by any volunteer campaign worker. "Part-time" services, for the pur-
13 poses of this definition, means services in addition to regular full-time
14 employment, or, in the case of an unemployed person or persons engaged in
15 part-time employment, services rendered without compensation or reimburse-
16 ment of expenses from any source other than the candidate or political action
17 committee for whom such services are rendered. For the purposes of this
18 chapter, contributions other than money or its equivalent shall be deemed to
19 have a money value equivalent to the fair market value of the contribution.
20 (3) "Election" means any state or local general, special, recall, or
21 primary election.
22 (4) "Election campaign" means any campaign in support of or in opposi-
23 tion to a candidate for election to public office and any campaign in support
24 of or in opposition to a measure.
25 (5)(a) "Electioneering communication" means any paid public communi-
26 cation that:
27 (i) Unambiguously refers to any candidate;
28 (ii) Is broadcast, printed, mailed, delivered, made, dis-
29 tributed, or disseminated to a recipient by telephone, in a digi-
30 tal format online, or by other electronic means during the sixty
31 (60) day period before a primary election or a general election;
32 and
33 (iii) Is directed to an audience that includes members of the elec-

21 ogy in a manner to create a realistic but false audio or video that:
22 (i) Appears to a reasonable individual to be of a real event, ac-
23 tion, or speech that did not actually occur in reality; and
24 (ii) Provides a fundamentally different understanding or impres-
25 sion of the event, action, or speech than a reasonable person would
26 have from the unaltered, original version of the audio recording
27 or video recording.

29 through the use of synthetic media in an electioneering communication, ex-
30 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure may seek injunctive or
31 other equitable relief prohibiting the publication of such synthetic media.
32 (4) A candidate whose action or speech is deceptively represented
33 through the use of synthetic media in an electioneering communication, ex-
34 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure may bring an action for

36 provider. The court may also award a prevailing party reasonable attorney's

38 plaintiff from securing or recovering any other available remedy.
39 (5) It shall be an affirmative defense for any action brought pursuant
40 to this section that the electioneering communication, expenditure by a

42 a disclosure stating, "This (video/audio) has been manipulated" in the fol-
43 lowing manner:

45 nently displayed and appear in a size easily readable by the average
46 viewer, and the disclosure must appear for the duration of the video; or
47 (b) If the media consists of audio only, the disclosure must be read in
48 a clearly spoken manner and in a pitch that can be easily heard by the
49 average listener at the beginning of the audio, at the end of the au-

15
1 dio, and, if the audio is greater than two (2) minutes in length, in-
2 terspersed within the audio at intervals of no more than two (2) minutes
3 each.
4 (6) In any action commenced pursuant to this section, the plaintiff
5 bears the burden of establishing the use of synthetic media by clear and
6 convincing evidence.
7 (7) Courts are encouraged to determine matters pursuant to this section
8 expediently.
9 (8) For an action brought pursuant to this section, the information
10 content provider of the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
11 candidate, or independent expenditure may be held liable and not the medium
12 disseminating the electioneering communication, expenditure by a candi-
13 date, or independent expenditure except as provided in subsection (9) of

17 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure that is subject to 47
18 U.S.C. 315, a medium may be held liable in a cause of action brought pursuant
19 to this section if:
20 (a) The medium removes any disclosure described in subsection (5) of
21 this section from the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
22 candidate, or independent expenditure it disseminates; or
23 (b) Subject to affirmative defenses described in this section, the
24 medium changes the content of an electioneering communication, ex-
25 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure such that it
26 qualifies as synthetic media.
27 (10) No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be
28 treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another
29 information content provider. However, an interactive computer service may
30 be held liable in accordance with subsection (9) of this section.
