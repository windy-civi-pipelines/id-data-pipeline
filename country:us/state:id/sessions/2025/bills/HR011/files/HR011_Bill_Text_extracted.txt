26 WHEREAS, in April 1789, the United States House of Representatives and
27 the United States Senate assembled for the first time and among their offi-
28 cial activities was to "go up to the house of God and in a solemn manner com-

40 implore His protection and favor"; and

2
1 thousands more since then in this centuries-old tradition that continues to
2 the present day; and
3 WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of the United States, in Marsh v. Chambers,

9 WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of the United States, in Zorach v. Clauson,

19 sublime truths announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history
20 that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord"; and
21 WHEREAS, President George Washington, in his farewell address, consid-

27 Legislature, that the Idaho House of Representatives follow this American
28 tradition of observing an official time of prayer to commemorate the First
29 Regular Session of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature.
