20 filed with, and approved by the commission (or approved on review by the
21 court), payable to the people of the state of Idaho, and sufficient in amount

24 order or decision of the commission, and of all moneys which that any person
25 or corporation may be compelled to pay, pending the review proceedings, for

33 company paying interest on deposits, under such conditions as the court may
34 prescribe, all sums of money which that it may collect from any corporation

44 public utility affected under the penalty of the immediate enforcement of
45 the order or decision of the commission (pending the review and notwith-
46 standing the suspending order) to keep such accounts verified by oath, as may
47 in the judgment of the commission suffice to show the amounts being charged
9
1 or received by such public utility, pending the review, in excess of the
2 charges allowed by the order or decision of the commission, together with
3 the names and addresses of the corporations or persons to whom overcharges
4 will be refundable in case the charges made by the public utility, pending
5 the review, be not sustained by the court. The court may, from time to time,
6 require said party petitioning for a review to give additional security on
7 or to increase the said suspending bond whenever in the opinion of the court
8 the same may be necessary to insure ensure the prompt payment of said damages
9 and said overcharges. Upon the final decision by the court, all moneys which
10 that the public utility may have collected, pending the appeal in excess of
11 those authorized by such final decision, together with interest in case the
12 court ordered the deposit of such moneys in a bank or trust company, shall
13 be promptly paid to the corporations or persons entitled thereto, in such
14 manner and through such methods of distribution as may be prescribed by the

25 sion, into the state treasury for the benefit of the general fund.

40 dar year 1954. The first quarter biennium installment of fees due on the
41 1955-1956 fiscal appropriation shall be made on or before May 15, 1955, and
42 semiannually thereafter as provided in section 61-1005 of this act.

2 July 1st, computed as in this act provided. Such fee shall be paid to the
3 commission in equal semiannual installments on or before the 15th days of
4 November and May 15 and November 15 in each fiscal calendar year. If payment
5 shall not be made on or before said respective dates, the installments so due
6 shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent percent (6%) per annum until
7 such time as the full amount of the installment shall have been paid. Upon
8 failure, refusal or neglect of any public utility or railroad corporation to
9 pay such fee, the attorney general shall commence an action in the name of the
10 state to collect the same.
11 SECTION 32. That Chapter 11, Title 61, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
12 hereby repealed.
13 SECTION 33. That Section 62-610F, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
14 amended to read as follows:
15 62-610F. HIGH-COST SUPPORT -- ADMINISTRATION -- TRANSITION. (1) The
16 commission shall establish a universal service fund to enable eligible
17 telecommunications carriers to make universal service widely available to
18 all persons within the state of Idaho at reasonable rates. Eligible telecom-
19 munications carriers receiving financial support shall use that support
20 only for the provision, maintenance and upgrading of services and facilities
21 for which the support is intended.
22 (2) The commission shall initiate a proceeding to determine and adopt
23 the appropriate methodology and mechanisms to collect and distribute fi-
24 nancial assistance which that are specific, predictable and sufficient in
25 conjunction with federal universal service support mechanisms to preserve
26 and advance universal service within the state of Idaho. Revenue for the
27 fund shall be collected through a uniform universal service fund surcharge
28 as calculated by the commission. The surcharge shall be imposed on end
29 users of all retail telecommunications services originating and terminating
30 within the state of Idaho and collected by the telecommunications carrier
31 providing telecommunications services to such end user. Disbursements from
32 the fund shall be used to defray the costs, as determined by the commission,
33 of providing universal service to customers within a geographic support
34 area. Those costs shall be calculated using a forward-looking cost method-
35 ology. When providing disbursements from the fund, the commission shall
36 take such actions as may be necessary to prevent redundant cost recovery by
37 recipients of such funds, including the reduction of access charges subject
38 to title 61 or 62, Idaho Code.
39 (3) The commission shall establish procedures to administer the uni-
40 versal service fund and shall contract with a neutral third party for ad-
41 ministration of the fund. The administrator shall perform the duties re-
42 quired by the commission including data gathering, collecting the surcharge
43 revenues, disbursing funds, and notifying the commission of any fund viola-
44 tions.
45 (4) The commission shall develop procedures and provide for a transi-
46 tion period to begin no earlier than January 1, 2001, for rural telephone
47 companies to replace funding available pursuant to section 62-610, Idaho
11
1 Code, with the funding mechanism established pursuant to this section for
2 the support of universal service.
3 SECTION 34. That Section 62-623, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
4 repealed.
5 SECTION 35. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
6 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
7 July 1, 2025.

2 charges allowed by the order or decision of the commission, together with

7 or to increase the said suspending bond whenever in the opinion of the court
8 the same may be necessary to insure ensure the prompt payment of said damages
9 and said overcharges. Upon the final decision by the court, all moneys which

17 telecommunications carriers to make universal service widely available to
18 all persons within the state of Idaho at reasonable rates. Eligible telecom-
19 munications carriers receiving financial support shall use that support
20 only for the provision, maintenance and upgrading of services and facilities
21 for which the support is intended.
22 (2) The commission shall initiate a proceeding to determine and adopt
23 the appropriate methodology and mechanisms to collect and distribute fi-
24 nancial assistance which that are specific, predictable and sufficient in
25 conjunction with federal universal service support mechanisms to preserve
26 and advance universal service within the state of Idaho. Revenue for the
27 fund shall be collected through a uniform universal service fund surcharge
28 as calculated by the commission. The surcharge shall be imposed on end
29 users of all retail telecommunications services originating and terminating
30 within the state of Idaho and collected by the telecommunications carrier
31 providing telecommunications services to such end user. Disbursements from
32 the fund shall be used to defray the costs, as determined by the commission,
33 of providing universal service to customers within a geographic support
34 area. Those costs shall be calculated using a forward-looking cost method-
35 ology. When providing disbursements from the fund, the commission shall
36 take such actions as may be necessary to prevent redundant cost recovery by
37 recipients of such funds, including the reduction of access charges subject
38 to title 61 or 62, Idaho Code.
39 (3) The commission shall establish procedures to administer the uni-
40 versal service fund and shall contract with a neutral third party for ad-
41 ministration of the fund. The administrator shall perform the duties re-
42 quired by the commission including data gathering, collecting the surcharge
43 revenues, disbursing funds, and notifying the commission of any fund viola-
44 tions.

46 tion period to begin no earlier than January 1, 2001, for rural telephone
47 companies to replace funding available pursuant to section 62-610, Idaho

11
1 Code, with the funding mechanism established pursuant to this section for
2 the support of universal service.
3 SECTION 34. That Section 62-623, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
4 repealed.
