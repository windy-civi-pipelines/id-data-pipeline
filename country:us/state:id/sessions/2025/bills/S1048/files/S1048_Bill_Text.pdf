13 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
14 SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. The Legislature finds that
15 this state was founded upon the fundamental truth that all men are created
16 equal and endowed with inalienable rights. Among these rights is the freedom
17 of inquiry, which along with the principle of liberal toleration is essen-
18 tial to the advancement and diffusion of knowledge. The constitution of this
19 state also declares that the stability of a republican form of government de-
20 pends mainly upon the intelligence of the people. In contravention of these
21 principles, a subversive ideology derived from the tenets of critical the-
22 ory has infected the administration of this state's system of higher educa-
23 tion, promoting a culture of division, ignorance, bigotry, and intolerance.
24 Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to eliminate all programs and
25 initiatives within all public institutions of higher education predicated
26 on the tenets of critical theory, or more commonly known under the title of
27 "diversity, equity, and inclusion."
28 SECTION 2. That Chapter 59, Title 67, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
29 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
30 ignated as Section 67-5909D, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
