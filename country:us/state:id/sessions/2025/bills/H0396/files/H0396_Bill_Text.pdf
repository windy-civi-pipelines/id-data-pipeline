17 SECTION 1. That Section 33-1006, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
18 amended to read as follows:
19 33-1006. TRANSPORTATION SUPPORT PROGRAM. (1) The state board of ed-
20 ucation shall determine what costs of transporting pupils, including main-
21 tenance, operation and depreciation of basic vehicles, insurance, payments
22 under contract with other public transportation providers whose vehicles
23 used to transport pupils comply with federal transit administration regula-
24 tions, "bus testing," 49 CFR part 665, and any revision thereto, as provided
25 in subsection (4)(d) of this section, or other state department of educa-
26 tion-approved private transportation providers, salaries of drivers, and
27 any other costs, shall be allowable in computing the transportation support
28 program of school districts authorized transportation operations.
29 (2) Any costs associated with the addition of vehicle features that are
30 not part of the basic vehicle shall not be allowable in computing the trans-
31 portation support program of school districts an authorized transportation
32 operation. A basic vehicle is hereby defined as the cost of the vehicle with-
33 out optional features, plus the addition of essential safety features and
34 features necessary for the transportation of pupils with disabilities.
35 (3) Each school district authorized transportation operation shall
36 maintain records and make reports as are required for the purposes of this
37 section.
38 (4) The transportation support program of a school district an autho-
39 rized transportation operation shall be based upon the allowable costs of:
40 (a) Transporting public school pupils one and one-half (1 1/2) miles or
41 more to school;

2
1 (b) Transporting pupils less than one and one-half (1 1/2) miles as pro-
2 vided in section 33-1501, Idaho Code, when approved by the state board
3 of education;
4 (c) Payments when transportation is not furnished, as provided in sec-
5 tion 33-1503, Idaho Code;
6 (d) The transportation program for grades 6-12 kindergarten through
7 grade 12, upon the costs of payments pursuant to a contract with other
8 public or private transportation providers entered into as provided
9 in section 33-1510, Idaho Code, if the school district authorized
10 transportation operation establishes that the reimbursable costs of
11 transportation under the contract are equal to or less than the costs
12 for school buses;
13 (e) The employer's share of contributions to the public employee re-
14 tirement system and to social security; and
15 (f) Providing transportation to and from approved school activities as
16 may be approved by the rules of the state board of education.
17 (5) The state's share of the transportation support program shall be
18 fifty percent (50%) of reimbursable transportation costs of the district
19 incurred by the authorized transportation operation during the immediately
20 preceding state fiscal year, except for the cost of state department of ed-
21 ucation training and fee assessments and bus depreciation and maintenance,
22 for which the state's share shall be eighty-five percent (85%) of such costs.
23 For school districts that contract for pupil transportation services, the
24 The state's share for authorized transportation operations that contract
25 for pupil transportation services shall be the average state share of costs
26 for authorized transportation operations that are school district-run op-
27 erations, based on the statewide total of such costs. Provided however,
28 that the reimbursable costs for any school district authorized transporta-
29 tion operation shall not exceed one hundred three percent (103%) of the
30 statewide average reimbursable cost per mile or the state statewide average
31 reimbursable cost per student rider, whichever is more advantageous to the
32 school district authorized transportation provider. If a school district's
33 an authorized transportation operation's costs exceed the one hundred three
34 percent (103%) limit when computed by the more advantageous of the two (2)
35 methods, that school district authorized transportation operation shall
36 be reimbursed at the appropriate percentage designated by this subsection,
37 multiplied by the maximum limit for whichever method is more favorable to the
38 school district authorized transportation operation. A school district An
39 authorized transportation operation may appeal the application of the one
40 hundred three percent (103%) limit on reimbursable costs to the state board
41 of education, which may establish for that district authorized transporta-
42 tion operation a new percentile limit for reimbursable costs compared to the
43 statewide average, which is higher than one hundred three percent (103%).
44 In doing so, the state board of education may set a new limit that is greater
45 than one hundred three percent (103%), but is less than the percentile limit
46 requested by the school district authorized transportation operation. How-
47 ever, the percentage increase in the one hundred three percent (103%) cap
48 shall not exceed the percentage of the district's authorized transportation
49 operation's bus runs that qualify as a hardship bus run, pursuant to this
50 subsection. Any costs above the new level established by the state board of

3
1 education shall not be reimbursed. Such a change shall only be granted by the
2 state board of education for hardship bus runs. To qualify as a hardship bus
3 run, such bus run shall meet at least two (2) of the following criteria:
4 (a) The number of student riders per mile is less than fifty percent
5 (50%) of the statewide average number of student riders per mile;
6 (b) Less than a majority of the miles on the bus run are by paved sur-
7 face, concrete or asphalt road;
8 (c) Over ten percent (10%) of the miles driven on the bus run are a five
9 percent (5%) slope or greater.
10 (6) Beginning on July 1, 2005, any eligible home-based public virtual
11 school may claim transportation reimbursement for the prior fiscal year's
12 cost of providing educational services to students. In order to be eligible,
13 such a school shall have at least one (1) average daily attendance divisor,
14 pursuant to section 33-1002, Idaho Code, that is greater than the median
15 divisor shown for any category of pupils, among the actual divisors listed.
16 For the purposes of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this subsection (6), "ed-
17 ucation provider" means the home-based public virtual school or an entity
18 that has legally contracted with the home-based public virtual school to
19 supply education services. Reimbursable costs shall be limited to the costs
20 of:
21 (a) Providing an internet connection service between the student and
22 the education provider, not including the cost of telephone service;
23 (b) Providing electronic and computer equipment used by the student
24 to transmit educational material between the student and the education
25 provider;
26 (c) Providing a toll-free telephone service for students to communi-
27 cate with the education provider;
28 (d) Providing education-related, face-to-face visits by representa-
29 tives of the home-based public virtual school, with such reimbursements
30 limited to the mileage costs set for state employee travel by the state
31 board of examiners; and
32 (e) Any actual pupil transportation costs that would be reimbursable
33 if claimed by an authorized transportation operation that is a school
34 district.
35 The total reimbursement for such home-based public virtual schools shall be
36 exempt from the statewide average cost per mile limitations of this section.
37 The state's share of reimbursable costs shall be eighty-five percent (85%),
38 subject to the statewide cost per student rider provisions of this section.
39 For the purposes of such home-based public virtual school, the number of stu-
40 dent riders shall be the same as the number of pupils in average daily atten-
41 dance.
42 (7) The state department of education shall calculate the amount of
43 state funds lost in fiscal year 2010 by each school district authorized
44 transportation operation as a result of the decrease in the state reim-
45 bursement from eighty-five percent (85%) to fifty percent (50%) of certain
46 eligible costs, including the reduction calculated for districts authorized
47 transportation operations that contract for pupil transportation services,
48 and excluding any reductions made due to the limitation on reimbursable
49 expenses, all pursuant to subsection (5) of this section. The amount so
50 calculated shall be distributed to each school district authorized trans-

4
1 portation operation in fiscal year 2010. For each fiscal year thereafter,
2 the amount distributed pursuant to this subsection for each school district
3 authorized transportation operation shall be determined as follows:
4 (a) Divide the amount distributed to the district authorized trans-
5 portation operation pursuant to this subsection in fiscal year 2010 by
6 the district's authorized transportation operation's support units for
7 fiscal year 2010;
8 (b) Multiply the result of the calculation found in paragraph (a) of
9 this subsection by the number of support units in the current fiscal
10 year, excluding any support units attributable to students educated
11 primarily through home-based or virtual means;
12 (c) Determine the percentage change in statewide transportation reim-
13 bursements as provided for in subsection (5) of this section since fis-
14 cal year 2010;
15 (d) Determine the percentage change in statewide student enrollment
16 since fiscal year 2010;
17 (e) Subtract the result of the calculation found in paragraph (d) of
18 this subsection from the result of the calculation found in paragraph
19 (c) of this subsection;
20 (f) Adjust the result of the calculation found in paragraph (b) of this
21 subsection by the percentage result from paragraph (e) of this subsec-
22 tion.
23 For authorized transportation operations that are school districts
24 that divided after fiscal year 2010, the calculation in paragraph (a) of
25 this subsection shall still be based on the fiscal year 2010 figures for
26 the formerly consolidated district. For authorized transportation oper-
27 ations that are public charter schools beginning operations on or after
28 July 1, 2009, all calculations in this subsection that are based on fiscal
29 year 2010 shall instead be based on the public charter school's first fiscal
30 year of operations. For the purposes of this subsection, the support units
31 used shall be the number used for calculating salary-based apportionment.
32 Funds distributed pursuant to this subsection shall be used to defray the
33 cost of pupil transportation. If the amount distributed is in excess of a
34 school district's an authorized transportation operation's actual pupil
35 transportation costs, less any state reimbursements provided by subsection
36 (5) of this section, the excess funds may be used at the school district's
37 authorized transportation operation's discretion.
38 (8) The total moneys paid to school districts and public charter
39 schools for eligible transportation costs shall be reduced by a proportion-
40 ate amount to equal seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($7,500,000)
41 and shall be used as discretionary spending.
42 (9) (8) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (5) of this sec-
43 tion, the state's share of the transportation support program will be based
44 on reimbursable transportation costs incurred by a school district an autho-
45 rized transportation provider during the state fiscal year prior to the im-
46 mediately preceding state fiscal year if, during the immediately preceding
47 state fiscal year:
48 (a) An emergency occurred in the state or in the area where the school
49 district authorized transportation operation is located. For purposes
50 of this subsection, an emergency includes but is not limited to school

5
1 closures caused by extreme weather conditions, a fire, an epidemic, or
2 pollution of air or water; and
3 (b) As a direct result of such emergency, the reimbursable transporta-
4 tion costs of a school district an authorized transportation operation
5 decreased by at least ten percent (10%) from the prior fiscal year.
6 (10) (9) Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, for the
7 duration of an emergency described in subsection (9) (8) of this section, the
8 miles for which transportation costs may be reimbursed will be miles:
9 (a) Directly associated with transporting students for the purpose of
10 school attendance during regular days and hours; or
11 (b) Related to the delivery of food, delivery of instructional mate-
12 rials, or other trips supporting the continuation of educational ser-
13 vices.
14 (10) As used in this section, "authorized transportation operation"
15 means a school district or public charter school transportation program au-
16 thorized by the state department of education that may include the use of any
17 vehicles authorized pursuant to chapter 15, title 33, Idaho Code.
18 SECTION 2. That Section 33-1501, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
19 amended to read as follows:
20 33-1501. TRANSPORTATION AUTHORIZED. To afford more equal opportu-
21 nity for public school attendance, the board of trustees of each district,
22 including specially chartered school districts, shall, where practicable,
23 provide transportation for the public school pupils within the district,
24 and pupils resident within adjoining districts annually agreed to in writ-
25 ing by the districts involved, under conditions and limitations herein set
26 forth. Nonpublic school students may be transported, where practicable,
27 when the full costs for providing such transportation are recovered. In
28 approving the routing of any school bus, or in the maintenance and operation
29 of all such transportation equipment, or in the appointment or employment of
30 chauffeurs, the primary requirements to be observed by the board of trustees
31 are the safety and adequate protection of the health of the pupils. Nothing
32 herein contained shall prevent any board of trustees from denying trans-
33 portation to any pupil in any school bus operated by or under the authority
34 of said board, upon good cause being given, in writing, to the parents or
35 guardian, or either of them, of such pupil.
36 No board of trustees shall be required to provide transportation for any
37 pupil living less than one and one-half (1 1/2) miles from the nearest ap-
38 propriate school. A board of trustees may require pupils who live less than
39 one and one-half (1 1/2) miles from the nearest established bus stop to walk
40 or provide their own transportation to such bus stop. That distance shall
41 be determined by the nearest and best route from the junction of the driveway
42 of the pupil's home and the nearest public road, to the nearest door of the
43 schoolhouse he attends, or to the bus stop, as the case may be. The board may
44 transport any pupil a lesser distance when in its judgment the age or health
45 or safety of the pupil warrants.
46 A day care center, family day care home, or a group day care facility,
47 as defined in section 39-1102, Idaho Code, may substitute for the student's
48 residence for student transportation to and from school. School districts
49 may not transport students between child care facilities and home. Student

6
1 transportation between a child care facility and a school will qualify for
2 state reimbursement providing that the child care facility is one and one-
3 half (1 1/2) miles or more from the school to which the student is trans-
4 ported.
5 To effectuate the public policy hereby declared, the board of trustees
6 of any school district may purchase or lease, and maintain and operate school
7 buses and vans, which vans shall not have a seating capacity in excess of fif-
8 teen (15) persons authorized vehicles for the transportation of pupils to
9 and from school and school-related events; may enter into agreements or con-
10 tracts for the use of a charter bus or buses; may enter into contracts with
11 individuals, firms, corporations or private carriers; or may make payments
12 to parents or guardians, subject to the limitations herein provided, when
13 transportation is not furnished by the district.
14 SECTION 3. That Section 33-1504, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
15 repealed.
