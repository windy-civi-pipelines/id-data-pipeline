25 der this chapter.
26 (10) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any insurer, in-
27 formation or transaction if and to the extent that the director by rule or or-

29 ing whether to issue an exemption, the director may consider the following:

32 system;

34 company system;

36 ates; and
37 (e) Any other factors the director deems appropriate.
38 Prior to issuing an exemption, the director shall notify all other insurance
39 regulators where the insurer or its affiliates hold a certificate of author-
40 ity.
41 (11) Any person may file with the director a disclaimer of affiliation
42 with any authorized insurer, or such a disclaimer may be filed by the insurer
43 or any member of an insurance holding company system. The disclaimer shall

48 disclaimer, notifies the filing party that the disclaimer is disallowed.
49 In the event of disallowance, the disclaiming party may request an admin-
50 istrative hearing pursuant to chapter 2, title 41, Idaho Code, which shall

6
1 be granted. The disclaiming party shall be relieved of its duty to register
2 under this section if approval of the disclaimer has been granted by the di-
3 rector, or if the disclaimer is deemed to have been approved.
4 (12) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to regis-
5 tration shall also file an annual enterprise risk report. The report shall,
6 to the best of the ultimate controlling person's knowledge and belief, iden-
7 tify the material risks within the insurance holding company system that
8 could pose enterprise risk to the insurer. The report shall be filed with the
9 lead state director of the insurance holding company system as determined
10 by the procedures within the financial analysis handbook adopted by the na-
11 tional association of insurance commissioners (NAIC).
12 (13)(a) Except as provided in this subsection, the ultimate control-
13 ling person of every insurer subject to registration shall concurrently
14 file with the registration an annual group capital calculation in ac-
15 cordance with the NAIC group capital calculation instructions. The
16 lead state director may allow a controlling person that is not the ul-
17 timate controlling person to file the group capital calculation. The
18 following insurance holding company systems shall be exempt from filing
19 the group capital calculation:
20 (i) An insurance holding company system that has only one (1) in-
21 surer within its holding company structure, that only writes busi-
22 ness in its domestic state, and that assumes no business from any
23 other insurer;
24 (ii) An insurance holding company system that is required to per-
25 form a group capital calculation specified by the United States
26 federal reserve board. If the calculation from the federal re-
27 serve board under the terms of information sharing agreements can-
28 not be shared with the lead state director, the insurance holding
29 company system is not exempt from the group capital calculation
30 filing;
31 (iii) An insurance holding company system whose non-United States
32 group-wide supervisor is located within a reciprocal jurisdiction
33 as described in section 41-515(2)(f)(i)1., Idaho Code, that rec-
34 ognizes the United States state regulatory approach to group su-
35 pervision and group capital; and
36 (iv) An insurance holding company system:
37 1. That provides information to the lead state that meets
38 the requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial
39 standards and accreditation program, either directly or
40 indirectly through the group-wide supervisor, who has de-
41 termined such information is satisfactory to allow the lead
42 state to comply with the provisions of section 41-3815A,
43 Idaho Code; and
44 2. Whose non-United States group-wide supervisor that is
45 not in a reciprocal jurisdiction recognizes and accepts, as
46 specified by the director in regulation, the group capital
47 calculation as the worldwide group capital assessment for
48 United States insurance groups who operate in that jurisdic-
49 tion.

7
1 (b) The exemptions described in paragraphs (a)(iii) and (iv) of this
2 subsection shall not prevent the lead state director from requiring
3 the group capital calculation for United States operations of any
4 non-United States-based insurance holding company system when it is
5 deemed appropriate for prudential oversight and solvency monitoring
6 purposes or for ensuring the competitiveness of the insurance market-
7 place.
8 (c) The lead state director may exempt the ultimate controlling per-
9 son from filing the annual group capital calculation or accept a limited
10 group capital filing as specified by the lead state director.
11 (d) If an insurance holding company system no longer meets the require-
12 ments for an exemption, the insurance holding company system shall file
13 the group capital calculation at the next annual filing date unless the
14 lead state director grants an extension.
15 (14) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to reg-
16 istration who is also scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework
17 shall file the results of a specific year's liquidity stress test. The fil-
18 ing shall be made to the lead state director of the insurance holding company
19 system.
20 (a) The NAIC liquidity stress test framework shall include scope cri-
21 teria applicable to a specific data year. Insurers meeting at least one
22 (1) threshold of the scope criteria shall be considered scoped into the
23 NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the specified data year unless
24 the lead state director determines the insurer should not be scoped into
25 the framework for that data year.
26 (b) The performance of, and filing of the results from, a specific
27 year's liquidity stress test shall comply with the instructions and
28 templates of the NAIC liquidity stress test framework.
29 (13) (15) The failure to file a registration statement or any summary of
30 the registration statement or enterprise risk filing required in this sec-
31 tion within the time specified for filing shall be a violation of the provi-
32 sions of this section.
33 SECTION 3. That Chapter 38, Title 41, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
34 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
35 ignated as Section 41-3809A, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:

6 material financial risk to the insurer's ability to honor policyholder
7 obligations.
8 (2) If an insurance holding company system has previously filed the
9 annual group capital calculation, the lead state director may accept, in
10 lieu of the group capital calculation, a limited group capital filing if the
11 insurance holding company system has annual direct written and unaffiliated
12 assumed premiums, including international direct and assumed premiums but
13 excluding premiums reinsured with the federal crop insurance corporation
14 and federal flood program, of less than one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000)

24 cial risk to the insurer's ability to honor policyholder obligations.
25 (3) No exemption under this section may prevent the lead state director
26 from requiring the ultimate controlling person to file an annual group capi-
27 tal calculation, at any time, if:

29 risk-based capital action level event as set forth in chapter 54, title

35 exhibits qualities deemed hazardous to the insurance buying public
36 based on unique circumstances, including but not limited to the type and

40 cept the group capital calculation when:
41 (a) With respect to section 41-3809(13), Idaho Code:
42 (i) The non-United States jurisdiction recognizes the United
43 States state regulatory approach to group supervision and group
44 capital by providing confirmation that insurers and insurance
45 groups whose lead state is accredited by the NAIC under the NAIC

12 to the international association of insurance supervisors multilateral
13 memorandum of understanding or other multilateral memoranda of under-
14 standing.

18 use by the director by rule, administrative order, or bulletin, shall be
19 the list of non-United States jurisdictions that recognize and accept
20 the group capital calculation.
21 (b) The list shall assist the lead state director in determining which
22 insurers shall file an annual group capital calculation. The list
23 shall clarify those situations in which a jurisdiction is exempted from
24 filing pursuant to section 41-3809(13)(a)(iv), Idaho Code. To assist
25 with a determination under section 41-3809(13)(b), Idaho Code, the list
26 shall also identify whether a jurisdiction that is exempted pursuant to
27 section 41-3809(13)(a)(iii) or (iv), Idaho Code, requires a group capi-
28 tal filing for any United States-based insurance group's operations in
29 such non-United States jurisdiction.

22 data is maintained; obtain the software that runs those systems either
23 through assumption of licensing agreements or otherwise; and restrict
24 the use of the data by the affiliate if it is not operating the insurer's
25 business. The affiliate shall provide a waiver of any landlord lien or
26 other encumbrance to give the insurer access to all records and data in
27 the event of the affiliate's default under a lease or other agreement;
28 and
29 (h) Premiums or other funds belonging to the insurer that are collected
30 by or held by an affiliate shall be the exclusive property of the insurer
31 and shall be subject to the control of the insurer. Any right of offset
32 in the event an insurer is placed into receivership shall be subject to
33 the provisions of chapter 33, title 41, Idaho Code.
34 (2) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and any

39 the insurer has notified the director in writing of its intention to enter
40 into the transaction at least thirty (30) days prior thereto, or such shorter
41 period as the director may permit, and the director has not disapproved it
42 within that period. The notice for amendments or modifications shall in-
43 clude the reasons for the change and the financial impact on the domestic
44 insurer. Informal notice shall be reported to the director within thirty
45 (30) days after the termination of a previously filed agreement, for deter-
46 mination of the type of filing required, if any.
47 (a) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans, extensions of credit, guaran-
48 tees or investments, provided the transactions are equal to or exceed:
49 (i) With respect to non-life insurers, the lesser of three per-

11
1 (25%) of surplus regarding policyholders as of December 31 of the
2 year immediately preceding;
3 (ii) With respect to life insurers, three percent (3%) of the in-
4 surer's admitted assets as of December 31 of the year immediately
5 preceding;
6 (b) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate,
7 where the insurer makes loans or extensions of credit with the agree-
8 ment or understanding that the proceeds of the transactions, in whole
9 or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of
10 credit to, to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, any affil-
11 iate of the insurer making the loans or extensions of credit, provided
12 the transactions are equal to or exceed:
13 (i) With respect to non-life insurers, the lesser of three per-
14 cent (3%) of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five percent
15 (25%) of surplus regarding policyholders as of December 31 of the
16 year immediately preceding;
17 (ii) With respect to life insurers, three percent (3%) of the in-
18 surer's admitted assets as of December 31 of the year immediately
19 preceding;
20 (c) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including:
21 (i) All reinsurance pooling agreements;
22 (ii) Agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in
23 the insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium
24 or a change in the insurer's liabilities, in any of the next three
25 (3) years, equals or exceeds five percent (5%) of the insurer's
26 surplus regarding policyholders, as of December 31 of the year
27 immediately preceding, including those agreements which that may
28 require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to
29 a nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between
30 the insurer and the nonaffiliate that any portion of the assets
31 will be transferred to one (1) or more affiliates of the insurer;
32 (d) All management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation
33 agreements, guarantees and all cost-sharing arrangements;
34 (e) Guarantees when made by a domestic insurer, provided however, that
35 a guarantee that is quantifiable as to amount is not subject to the
36 notice requirement of this section, unless it exceeds the lesser of
37 one-half of one percent (.5%) of the insurer's admitted assets or ten
38 percent (10%) of surplus regarding policyholders as of December 31 of
39 the year immediately preceding. Further, all guarantees that are not
40 quantifiable as to amount are subject to the notice requirements of this
41 section;
42 (f) Direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in a person that
43 controls the insurer or in an affiliate of the insurer in an amount
44 that, together with the insurer's present holdings in such invest-
45 ments, exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the insurer's surplus
46 to policyholders. Direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in
47 subsidiaries acquired pursuant to section 41-3803, Idaho Code, or au-
48 thorized under any other section of this chapter, or in nonsubsidiary
49 insurance affiliates that are subject to the provisions of this chap-
50 ter, are exempt from this requirement; and

12
1 (g) Any material transactions, specified by statute or rule, that the
2 director determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's
3 policyholders.
4 (3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize or permit any
5 transactions that, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same insur-
6 ance holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.
7 (3) (4) A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions that are part
8 of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the insurance
9 holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to
10 avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would oc-
11 cur otherwise. If the director determines that separate transactions were
12 entered into over any twelve (12) month period for that purpose, the director
13 may exercise his authority pursuant to section 41-3819, Idaho Code.
14 (4) (5) The director, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subsection
15 (2) of this section, shall consider whether the transactions comply with the
16 standards set forth in subsection (1) of this section and whether they may
17 adversely affect the interests of policyholders.
18 (5) (6) The director shall be notified within thirty (30) days of any
19 investment of the domestic insurer in any one (1) corporation, if the total
20 investment in the corporation by the insurance holding company system ex-
21 ceeds ten percent (10%) of the corporation's voting securities.
22 (7)(a) Any affiliate to an agreement or contract with a domestic in-
23 surer that is subject to the provisions of subsection (2)(d) of this
24 section shall be subject to the jurisdiction of any supervision,
25 seizure, conservatorship, or receivership proceedings against the
26 insurer and to the authority of any supervisor, conservator, rehabili-
27 tator, or liquidator for the insurer appointed pursuant to chapter 33,
28 title 41, Idaho Code, for the purpose of interpreting, enforcing, and
29 overseeing the affiliate's obligations under the agreement or contract
30 to perform services for the insurer that:
31 (i) Are an integral part of the insurer's operations, including
32 but not limited to management, administration, accounting, data
33 processing, marketing, underwriting, claims handling, invest-
34 ment, or any other similar functions; or
35 (ii) Are essential to the insurer's ability to fulfill its obliga-
36 tions under insurance policies.
37 (b) The director may require that an agreement or contract pursuant
38 to subsection (2)(d) of this section for the provision of services de-
39 scribed in paragraph (a) of this subsection specify that the affiliate
40 consents to the jurisdiction as set forth in this section.

6 other information public without the prior written consent of the insurer
7 to which it pertains, unless the director, after giving the insurer and its
8 affiliates who would be affected notice and opportunity to be heard, deter-
9 mines that the interest of policyholders, shareholders or the public will be
10 served by the publication, in which event the director may publish all or any
11 part in such manner as may be deemed appropriate.

24 reserve board or non-United States group-wide supervisors.
25 (2) Neither the director nor any person who receives documents, materi-
26 als or other information while acting under the authority of the director or
27 with whom such documents, materials or other information is shared pursuant
28 to this chapter, shall be permitted or required to testify in any private
29 civil action concerning any confidential documents, materials or informa-

35 subject to subsection (1) of this section, with other state, federal
36 and international regulatory agencies, with the national association
37 of insurance commissioners (NAIC) and its affiliates and subsidiaries,
38 and with state, federal and international law enforcement authori-
39 ties, including members of any supervisory college described in section
40 41-3815, Idaho Code, provided that the recipient agrees in writing to
41 maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of the document,
42 material or other information and has verified in writing the legal au-
43 thority to maintain confidentiality;
44 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3) paragraph (a) of
45 this subsection, the director may only share confidential and privi-
46 leged documents, materials or information reported pursuant to section
47 41-3809(12), Idaho Code, with commissioners of states having statutes
48 or regulations substantially similar to subsection (1) of this section
49 and who have agreed in writing not to disclose such information;

14
1 (c) May receive documents, materials or information, including other-
2 wise confidential and privileged documents, materials or information,
3 from the national association of insurance commissioners NAIC and its
4 affiliates and subsidiaries and from regulatory and law enforcement of-
5 ficials of other foreign or domestic jurisdictions and shall maintain
6 as confidential or privileged any document, material or information re-
7 ceived with notice or the understanding that it is confidential or priv-
8 ileged under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of the docu-
9 ment, material or information; and
10 (d) Shall enter into written agreements with the national association
11 of insurance commissioners NAIC governing sharing and use of informa-
12 tion provided pursuant to the provisions of this chapter consistent

18 director pursuant to this chapter, including procedures and pro-
19 tocols for sharing by the national association of insurance com-
20 missioners NAIC with other state, federal or international regu-

22 writing to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of
23 the documents, materials, or other information and has verified in
24 writing the legal authority to maintain such confidentiality;
25 (ii) Specify that ownership of information shared with the

40 disclosure of such confidential information has been requested or
41 subpoenaed or otherwise sought; and
42 (iv) (v) Require the national association of insurance commis-
43 sioners and its affiliates and subsidiaries NAIC or a third-party
44 consultant designated by the director to consent to intervention
45 by an insurer in any judicial, administrative, or similar action
46 in which the national association of insurance commissioners and
47 its affiliates and subsidiaries NAIC or a third-party consultant
48 designated by the director may be required to disclose confiden-
49 tial information about the insurer shared with the national asso-
50 ciation of insurance commissioners and the insurer's affiliates

15
1 and subsidiaries NAIC or a third-party consultant designated by
2 the director pursuant to this chapter.; and
3 (vi) For documents, materials, or information reported pursuant
4 to section 41-3809(14), Idaho Code, in the case of an agreement in-
5 volving a third-party consultant, provide for notification of the
6 identity of the consultant to the applicable insurers.
7 (4) The sharing of information by the director pursuant to this chapter
8 shall not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority or rulemaking, and
9 the director is solely responsible for the administration, execution and en-
10 forcement of the provisions of this chapter.

19 be subject to public disclosure, shall not be subject to subpoena and shall
20 not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any private civil
21 action.
22 (7) The group capital calculation and resulting group capital ratio
23 required pursuant to section 41-3809(13), Idaho Code, and the liquidity
24 stress test along with its results and supporting disclosures required pur-
25 suant to section 41-3809(14), Idaho Code, shall be considered regulatory
26 tools and are not intended as a means to rank insurers or insurance holding

29 lating, or placing before the public, directly or indirectly, by any written
30 or electronic means of communication available to the public, or in any other

32 liquidity stress test results, or supporting disclosures for the liquidity
33 stress test of any insurer or any insurer group, or of any component derived
34 in the calculation by any person engaged in any manner in the insurance busi-
35 ness is hereby prohibited.
