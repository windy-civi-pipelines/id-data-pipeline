30 repealed.
31 SECTION 2. That Section 63-405, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
32 amended to read as follows:
33 63-405. ASSESSMENT OF OPERATING PROPERTY. (1) The state tax commis-
34 sion must assess all taxable operating property at a meeting of the commis-
35 sion convening on the second Monday of August in each year, and must complete
36 the assessment of such property on the fourth Monday in August.
37 (2) The state tax commission shall determine the system value and cal-
38 culate the allocation and apportionment of the system value for all taxable
39 operating property and specifically determine:
40 (a) The number of miles and the value per mile of each railroad in the
41 state and for each taxing district in which such railroad may exist.

2
1 (b) The number of miles and the value per mile of each telephone corpo-
2 ration in the state and for each taxing district in which such telephone
3 corporation may exist.
4 (c) The number of miles and the value per mile of each pipeline in the
5 state and for each taxing district in which such pipeline may exist.
6 (d) The number of miles and the value per mile of each water company
7 under the jurisdiction of the public utilities commission in the state,
8 and for each taxing district in which such water company may exist. The
9 value per mile of any line included in this subsection, except rail-
10 roads, shall be determined by dividing the total value of such line
11 within the state by the number of miles of such line within the state.
12 The value per mile of railroad line shall be determined by apportionment
13 of the total value of line within the state. The apportionment shall
14 be based twenty percent (20%) on the ratio of line miles in the state to
15 line miles in the county; forty percent (40%) on the ratio of net ton
16 miles in the state to net ton miles in the county; and forty percent
17 (40%) on the ratio of station revenues in the state to station revenues
18 in the county. All operating property of railroads shall be apportioned
19 to the counties as part of the railroad line in the county. The appor-
20 tionment for taxing districts shall be the same as the apportionment
21 among counties.
22 (e) The system value, the number of miles and the value per mile of each
23 electric current transmission line and each electric current distribu-
24 tion line in each county separately, and for each taxing district within
25 said county in which such transmission and distribution lines may ex-
26 ist. The value per mile of any line included in this subsection shall
27 be determined by dividing the apportioned value of such line within each
28 county by the number of miles of such line within said county.
29 (f) (e) The system value of private railcar fleets entering or standing
30 in Idaho in the year preceding the constituted lien as provided in sec-
31 tion 63-411(3), Idaho Code.
32 (g) (f) The system value and calculate the allocation and apportionment
33 of the system value for all other taxable operating property.
34 (3) On and after January 1, 2004, any newly installed or constructed
35 equipment located within a city corporate limit or within five (5) miles
36 of a city corporate limit and used for and in conjunction with the thermal
37 generation of electricity shall be apportioned based on physical location.
38 For purposes of this subsection newly installed or constructed equipment
39 used for and in conjunction with the thermal generation of electricity shall
40 not include the remodeling, retrofitting, rehabilitation, refurbishing or
41 modification of an existing electrical generation facility, or integration
42 or transformation facilities such as substations or transmission lines.
43 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 63-301A, Idaho Code, property
44 apportioned based on physical location pursuant to this subsection shall be
45 placed on the new construction roll. For rate-regulated electric utility
46 companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas
47 companies subject to taxation as provided in section 63-3502B(3) or (4),
48 Idaho Code, the state tax commission shall determine the amount of such tax
49 to be apportioned to each county separately in proportion to the property
50 tax levied by all eligible taxing districts and units and amounts allocated

3
1 to each urban renewal agency statewide in tax year 2025 on the operating
2 property of rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated af-
3 filiated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies. The 2025 property
4 tax amounts levied or allocated shall be certified by each county auditor
5 to the state tax commission no later than January 12, 2026. The state tax
6 commission shall calculate proportions by dividing the total amount so re-
7 ported for each county by the sum of all such amounts for all eligible taxing
8 districts and units and urban renewal agencies statewide. Taxing dis-
9 tricts, units, and urban renewal agencies are eligible for a proportion of
10 this tax and are included in the calculation of these proportions, provided
11 they levied property tax against the operating property of rate-regulated
12 electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and
13 rate-regulated gas companies or received an allocation of property tax paid
14 by such companies for tax year 2025. In the event that a taxing district
15 or unit or urban renewal revenue allocation area dissolves or is no longer
16 present in a county, or a voter approved bond expires, the proportions for
17 each taxing district in each affected county shall be changed as follows:
18 (a) The state tax commission shall reapportion the kilowatt-hour and
19 thermal energy tax revenue that would have accrued to the dissolving
20 district or revenue allocation area or expiring voter approved bond.
21 The reapportioned tax shall be distributed to each otherwise eligible
22 taxing district and revenue allocation area in the county with bound-
23 aries that overlapped the dissolved district or revenue allocation area
24 or expired voter approved bond. The proportionate share for each taxing
25 district and revenue allocation area shall be determined by dividing
26 the current distribution to that district and revenue allocation area
27 by the total distribution to all districts and revenue allocation areas
28 that overlap the dissolving district or revenue allocation area.
29 (b) Such reapportionment shall be made in the year immediately follow-
30 ing the year of the dissolution and the county auditor shall be notified
31 of the changed proportions no later than the first Monday in March of
32 that year.
33 (c) The proportions used to determine the amount of kilowatt-hour tax
34 and thermal energy tax to be billed to rate-regulated electric utility
35 companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-reg-
36 ulated gas companies and payable to each county pursuant to section
37 63-3503C(2), Idaho Code, shall not change.
38 (4) At least once every five (5) years, the state tax commission shall
39 examine and verify the investment of each rate-regulated electric utility
40 company, rate-regulated affiliated gas company, and rate-regulated gas com-
41 pany in each county and shall submit a report to the legislature that details
42 each county's investment in relation to the total statewide investment.
43 (4) (5) If the value of property of any company assessable under this
44 section is of such a nature that it cannot reasonably be apportioned on the
45 basis of rail, wire, and pipeline mileage, such as microwave and radio relay
46 stations, the tax commission may adopt such other method or basis of appor-
47 tionment to the county and taxing districts in which the property is situate
48 as may be feasible and proper.
49 (6) Any departure from market value in an assessment of operating prop-
50 erty made to ensure compliance with federal law or precedent shall be consid-

4
1 ered an exemption. The state tax commission shall identify such departures
2 from market value in their appraisals and no application need be made by a
3 taxpayer to receive such exemption.
4 SECTION 3. That Section 63-602O, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
5 repealed.

20 ity companies shall be reduced and shall be exempt from taxation to the
21 extent of kilowatt-hours used for furnishing power for pumping water
22 for irrigation or drainage purposes on lands in the state of Idaho.
23 The reduction shall be in the amount of nine hundred twenty-three mil-
24 lionths of a dollar ($0.000923) per kilowatt-hour billed to each user
25 of power using pumping water for irrigation or drainage purposes. The
26 utility shall determine the credit to which each consumer is entitled
27 by virtue of this exemption and shall refund that amount or credit the
28 amount against the consumer's bills.
29 (b) The exemption provided for in this section shall accrue to the ben-

13 thereof. In any action to enforce payment of any delinquent taxes due under
14 this section, the county pursuing such action shall be entitled to a judg-
15 ment for the reasonable costs of prosecuting such action, as well as for the
16 delinquent taxes, penalty, and interest.
17 (8) If a rate-regulated electric utility, rate-regulated affiliated
18 gas company, or rate-regulated gas company fails to file the statement of
19 kilowatt-hours or therms sold in Idaho required pursuant to subsection (1)
