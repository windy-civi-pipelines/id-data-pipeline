11 We, your Memorialists, the Senate and the House of Representatives of
12 the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Sixty-eighth
13 Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that:
14 WHEREAS, Idaho, The Gem State, hosts abundant mineral resources that
15 have been and continue to be an integral part of Idaho's economy and Ameri-
16 can prosperity; and
17 WHEREAS, the Stibnite Mining District in central Idaho is rich with
18 gold, antimony, tungsten, and silver and has hosted mining activity for
19 nearly a century after it was discovered at the turn of the 20th century; and
20 WHEREAS, during World War II, the mine site produced approximately half
21 of the tungsten and up to 90% of the antimony for the United States war ef-
22 fort; and
23 WHEREAS, because the mine was abandoned before modern regulations guar-
24 anteed cleanup, the Stibnite Mining District was left with severe environ-
25 mental legacies that continue to degrade water quality and the environment
26 of Idaho; and
27 WHEREAS, today, the Stibnite Mining District still holds a significant
28 reserve of 4.8 million ounces of gold and 148 million pounds of antimony; and
29 WHEREAS, the United States has urgent national defense needs for a se-
30 cure antimony supply; and
31 WHEREAS, Perpetua Resources' Stibnite Gold Project has the only identi-
32 fied domestic reserve of antimony, which could satisfy about 35% of domestic
33 antimony demand in the first six years of production and fulfill long-term
34 United States defense needs for antimony trisulfide; and
35 WHEREAS, currently, China, Russia, and Tajikistan control 90% of the
36 world's antimony supply; and
37 WHEREAS, in 2024, the Chinese Communist Party restricted all antimony
38 exports to the United States; and
39 WHEREAS, Perpetua Resources designed the redevelopment of the Stibnite
40 Mining District to improve the environmental conditions previously left be-
41 hind and took great care to incorporate the needs and perspectives of Idaho
42 communities into the design of the Stibnite Gold Project, including making
43 project modifications to address the concerns of nearby residents, to accom-
2
1 modate recreation interests, to reduce the project footprint, and to leave
2 environmental conditions better than they are today; and
3 WHEREAS, Perpetua Resources will invest approximately $2.2 billion in
4 the construction of the Stibnite Gold Project, which will include upgrades
5 to Idaho's power and road infrastructure, employ over 500 people annually
6 throughout the mining operations, and spend more than $220 million annually
7 in operational expenses throughout the life of the mine, supporting Idaho's
8 local and state economy; and
9 WHEREAS, Perpetua Resources has already invested over $19 million in
10 early site cleanup activities to help improve water quality in the region;
11 and
12 WHEREAS, Perpetua Resources has and will continue to dedicate valuable
13 resources back to Idaho's local communities and pave the way for responsible
14 mining projects in the State of Idaho; and
15 WHEREAS, after nearly a decade of consultation, scientific evaluation,
16 and analysis, including the evaluation and analysis of reasonable alterna-
17 tives, the United States Forest Service issued a Final Record of Decision
18 supporting Perpetua Resources' proposed mine plan on January 3, 2025; and
19 WHEREAS, the critical minerals produced by the Stibnite Gold Project
20 will be vital to our nation's energy and national security and the State of
21 Idaho has coordinated the permitting process between state agencies; and
22 WHEREAS, the Final Record of Decision found that mining operations and
23 closure activities will open currently inaccessible habitat for salmon and
24 other fish species, improve water quality and river habitat, and uplift en-
25 vironmental conditions, including cleaning up various legacy contamination
26 at the abandoned mine site; and
27 WHEREAS, the selection of the Burntlog Route as the primary mine access
28 route prioritizes transportation safety, reduces potential impacts to the
29 residents of Yellow Pine, utilizes existing routes as much as possible, and
30 reduces potential risks to Idaho's scenic rivers and wetlands; and
31 WHEREAS, Perpetua Resources will provide financial assurances to the
32 State of Idaho and the federal government to ensure environmental reclama-
33 tion for the Stibnite Gold Project is completed; and
34 WHEREAS, this Final Record of Decision solidifies America's unwavering
35 dedication to secure a domestic mineral supply chain while also exhibiting
36 environmental stewardship.
37 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
38 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Rep-
39 resentatives concurring therein, that the Legislature commends the approval
40 of the Stibnite Gold Project and encourages the Trump administration and the
41 State of Idaho to dedicate the necessary attention and resources to ensure
42 the Stibnite Gold Project completes necessary permitting and enters into de-
43 velopment without undue delay.
44 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature requests that Idaho state
45 and federal agencies complete careful and expeditious permitting for criti-
46 cal and strategic mineral projects in the United States.
47 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is
48 hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the
