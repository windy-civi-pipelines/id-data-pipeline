4 Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:

6 proportion that has steadily increased, reflecting the growing importance
7 of urban areas; and
8 WHEREAS, Idaho's localities collectively maintain 34,556 miles of
9 roads and vital infrastructure that support the state's transportation and
10 economic systems, making up 64.8% of the total roads in the state; and
11 WHEREAS, over 71% of Idaho's businesses are located within city bound-
12 aries, contributing significantly to the state's economy, with urban areas
13 generating the majority of retail, service, and industrial activity; and
14 WHEREAS, municipal governments provide essential services, including
15 public safety, utilities, parks and recreation, and more, which directly im-

17 WHEREAS, local governments collectively spend over $1.1 billion annu-

26 WHEREAS, local officials are excellently positioned to address the
27 unique needs of their communities, as they possess firsthand knowledge and
28 direct accountability to their constituents; and

33 tain services and infrastructure without overreliance on property tax or
34 other restrictive funding mechanisms.
