47 fered for one (1) price for the combined features that the travel protection

18 tle 41, Idaho Code, regarding the sale and marketing of travel insurance and
19 travel protection plans, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
20 (2) Offering or selling a travel insurance policy that could never re-
21 sult in payment of any claims for any insured under the policy is consid-

23 or practice prohibited pursuant to the provisions of chapter 13, title 41,
24 Idaho Code.
25 (3) With regard to marketing practices:
26 (a) All documents provided to consumers prior to the purchase of travel

32 isting condition exclusions, information and an opportunity to learn

34 time prior to the time of purchase and in the coverage's fulfillment ma-
35 terials.
36 (c) The fulfillment materials and the information described in sec-
37 tion 41-1092(2)(a), Idaho Code, shall be provided to a policyholder

2 ment materials whether the travel insurance is primary or secondary to
3 other applicable coverage.

6 not be an unfair or deceptive act or practice or other violation of law
7 for the website to provide an accurate summary or short description of
8 coverage, as long as the consumer has access to the full provisions of
9 the policy through electronic means.
10 (4) No person offering, soliciting, or negotiating travel insurance or
11 travel protection plans on an individual or group basis may do so by using
12 negative option or opt out, which would require a consumer to take an affir-
13 mative action to deselect coverage, such as unchecking a box on an electronic
14 form, at the time the consumer purchases a trip.
15 (5) It shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice to market blanket
16 travel insurance coverage as free.
17 (6) Where a consumer's destination jurisdiction requires insurance
18 coverage, it shall not be an unfair or deceptive act or practice to require
19 that the consumer choose between the following options as a condition of
20 purchasing a trip or travel package:
21 (a) Purchasing the coverage required by the destination jurisdiction
22 through the travel retailer or limited lines travel insurance producer
23 supplying the trip or travel package; or
