17 the provisions of this section for use by hunters that have entered into a
18 signed agreement for that year to utilize the services of an outfitter li-

34 capped, controlled, and any future restricted hunts, when tag numbers
35 change for all users, they or when a new hunt is created, such changes
36 will apply proportionally to all user groups.
37 In controlled hunts, the commission may allocate the number of out-
38 fitted hunter elk or deer tags based on a number compiled from each out-
39 fitter's highest year within the last two (2) years of all elk or deer
40 tags using the services of an outfitter for each controlled hunt. Any
41 additional tags above the original outfitted hunter tag quota may come
42 from the nonresident outfitted hunter set-aside pool or the nonresident
43 quota in the controlled hunt, not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
44 nonresident quota for each controlled hunt.

9 LIMITED -- OUTFITTERS SET-ASIDE. (1) Tags and Permits -- Method of Use. The
10 commission is hereby authorized to prescribe the number and kind of wildlife
11 that may be taken under authority of the several types of tags and permits

20 further authorized to limit the number or prohibit entirely the participa-
21 tion by nonresidents in controlled hunts.
22 (3) Outfitted Hunter Tags Set-Aside. When the commission establishes
23 a limit as to the number of nonresident deer tags and nonresident elk tags,
24 it shall set aside, when setting big game seasons, in a statewide pool, a
25 maximum of three thousand eight hundred seventy-five (3,875) nonresident
26 deer tags and three thousand two hundred (3,200) nonresident elk tags or
27 twenty-five percent (25%) of the nonresident deer tag and nonresident elk

29 to the licensed outfitted hunters in capped hunts, limited hunts, and con-
30 trolled hunts, and any future restricted hunts and set aside for outfitted
31 hunter use in general hunts.
32 (a) Such outfitted allocated set-aside tags shall be separate from the

38 lize the services of an outfitter licensed pursuant to chapter 21, title
39 36, Idaho Code.
40 (b) In order for a person to purchase any set-aside nonresident deer
41 tag or nonresident elk tag, that person's outfitter must submit an ap-

2 hunts pursuant to this subsection are unsold by July 15 of the year in
3 which they were set aside, they may be sold by the department to the gen-
4 eral public pursuant to commission rule. If any nonresident deer tags
5 or nonresident elk tags set aside as general capped allocated tags and
6 allocated pursuant to this subsection are unsold by July 31 of the year
7 in which they were set aside, they may be sold by the department to the
8 general public pursuant to commission rule.
9 (c) The commission may shall promulgate and implement all necessary
10 rules to implement, subject to legislative approval, in accordance with
11 the provisions of this subsection.
12 (4) Deer and Elk Tag Allocation. When setting big game seasons, if the
13 commission limits the number of deer or elk tags available for use in any game
14 management area, unit, or zone, the commission may shall allocate by rule,
15 where there are licensed outfitted operations, a number of deer and elk tags
16 from the outfitted hunter set-aside pool of tags as determined according to
17 the provisions of this section for use by hunters that have entered into a
18 signed agreement for that year to utilize the services of an outfitter li-
19 censed pursuant to chapter 21, title 36, Idaho Code.

21 location, or pursuant to in accordance with this section, in capped,

23 shall allocate the number of outfitted hunter elk and deer tags based on
24 the highest number within each of the last two (2) years of all elk or
