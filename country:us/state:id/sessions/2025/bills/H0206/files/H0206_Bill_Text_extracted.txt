5 tention to the importance of emergency medical services in Idaho; and
6 (b) Locating the state administration of emergency medical services at
7 the same state agency that already coordinates emergency management at
8 the state and local level will lead to improved services and provide op-
9 portunity for continued improvement and cross collaboration for these
10 comparable systems.
11 (2) It is the intent of the Legislature that:
12 (a) The director of the Department of Health and Welfare and the adju-
13 tant general at the Idaho Military Division coordinate the transfer of
14 emergency medical service functions from the Department of Health and
15 Welfare to the Idaho Military Division as described in this act and that
16 the transfer be complete effective July 1, 2025;
17 (b) All existing, but no new, rights, powers, duties, budgets, funds,
18 contracts, rules, regulations, and policies, administrative and rule-
19 making proceedings, contested cases, civil actions, and other matters
20 relating to emergency medical services described in this act, currently
21 vested with the director of the Department of Health and Welfare and the
22 Board of Health and Welfare, be transferred to the Idaho Military Divi-
23 sion as described in this act no later than July 1, 2025;
24 (c) Emergency medical services rulemaking authority sunset on July 1,
25 2027, and that before the adjournment sine die of the first regular ses-
26 sion of the 69th Idaho Legislature, the Idaho Military Division's emer-
27 gency medical services program propose for codification in the chapter
28 created in this act any necessary provision found in EMS administrative
29 rules; and
30 (d) The adjutant general explore any organizational efficiencies from

41 tent with provisions of this chapter, there is hereby established within the
42 division an emergency medical services program. The adjutant general, as
43 administrator of the division, shall supervise and administer the emergency
44 medical services program and shall hire or cause to be hired the necessary
45 personnel responsible for administering it. The responsibilities of the
46 emergency medical services program shall include but are not limited to
47 assisting qualified entities in providing first aid emergency medical ser-
4
1 vices and providing transportation of the sick and injured. The division is

3 gency medical services, licensing, and certification in Idaho and to issue
4 emergency medical services certifications, licenses, and permits.

10 cal services by licensed EMS personnel at emergency scenes, establishment of
11 fees for training, inspections, and licensure, appropriate requirements for
12 renewal of licensure of personnel and agencies, and the management of com-
13 plaints, investigations, and license actions against licensed EMS person-
14 nel and agencies. Additionally, in consultation with the medical director,
15 the division shall develop guidelines, standards, and procedures for reduc-
16 ing exposure to pathogens from human blood, tissue, or fluids. Such guide-
17 lines, standards, and procedures shall be made available to all law enforce-
18 ment personnel, all emergency medical services personnel and agencies, and
19 such other emergency personnel who request such information.

34 ing moneys, subject to legislative appropriation, from the emergency med-
35 ical services vehicle and equipment grant fund created in section 57-830,
36 Idaho Code, to qualifying nonprofit and governmental entities that submit an
37 application for a grant from the fund. Grants from the fund may cover the
38 cost of vehicles and equipment, training, licensing expenses, communica-
39 tion technology, dispatch services, and costs associated with assuring the
40 performance of planned coverage and emergency response, including highway
41 safety and emergency response to motor vehicle accidents.
42 (a) The division shall approve grants from the fund based on the follow-
43 ing criteria:
44 (i) The applicant is a nonprofit or governmental entity that
45 holds a current license as an ambulance or nontransport service
46 issued by the division;
47 (ii) The applicant has demonstrated need based on criteria estab-
48 lished by the division;
5
1 (iii) The applicant has provided verification that it has received
2 the approval and endorsement of a fire district, city, or county
3 within its service area;
4 (iv) The applicant has certified that the title to any vehicle
5 purchased with funds from the fund shall be in the name of the fire
6 district, city, or county that endorsed the application and shall
7 submit proof of titling to the division as soon as practicable; and
8 (v) The state of Idaho shall retain a security interest in the ve-
9 hicle to secure the performance of the grant recipient to utilize
10 the vehicle consistent with the intent described in the applica-
11 tion.
12 (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(iii) and (iv) of
13 this subsection, the division is authorized to approve and issue a grant
14 to an applicant in the absence of an endorsement if the endorsement is
15 withheld without adequate justification.
16 (2) The division shall be responsible for distributing moneys, subject
17 to legislative appropriation, from the emergency medical services fund cre-
18 ated in section 57-829, Idaho Code. Moneys in the fund shall be used exclu-
19 sively for costs associated with emergency medical services. However, if
20 the legislature appropriates moneys to the fund for sustainability grants
21 to cover personnel and operating costs associated with assuring the sustain-
22 ability and availability of emergency medical services, applicants may only
23 be approved by the division subject to the following criteria:
24 (a) The applicant is a nonprofit or governmental entity that holds a
25 current emergency medical services agency license issued by the divi-
26 sion that authorizes the agency as a 911 response agency;
27 (b) The application clearly defines the applicant's service area spe-
28 cific to 911 response;
29 (c) The applicant must certify, if it is eligible to bill for services,
30 that it has billed health insurance carriers for at least eighty percent
31 (80%) of eligible billable services it provided in the previous year.
32 If the applicant is newly licensed and does not have twelve (12) months
33 of historical billing information, the applicant must certify that it
34 is currently billing and will continue to bill health insurance carri-
35 ers for at least eighty percent (80%) of eligible services; and
36 (d) If the applicant fulfills the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b),
37 and (c) of this subsection, the county in which the applicant provides
38 911 response services may, in its discretion, endorse the grant appli-
39 cation of the requesting entity. A county endorsing an application must
40 have submitted a plan that has been approved by the division that spec-
41 ifies how emergency medical services 911 responses shall be covered and
42 coordinated throughout the entire county.
43 (3) The provision of emergency medical services is a government func-
44 tion. If the division approves applications for sustainability grants
45 pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, counties are authorized and re-
46 quired to ensure that emergency medical services are reasonably available
47 throughout the county.
48 (4) It is the intent of the legislature that counties that accept sus-
49 tainability grants pursuant to subsection (2) of this section use a portion
6
1 of the sustainability grant to implement or maintain community health EMS in
2 the service area.

39 STATEMENT OF INTENT. Time sensitive emergencies, specifically blunt trauma
40 injuries, strokes and heart attacks, were three (3) of the top five (5)
41 causes of deaths death in Idaho in 2011. Numerous studies throughout the
42 United States have demonstrated that organized systems of care improve
43 patient outcomes, thus reducing the frequency of preventable death and im-
44 proving the functional status of the patient. The institute of medicine's
45 report "Hospital-Based Emergency Care: At the Breaking Point" recommended
46 improving the care of critical illness through regionalization by trans-
47 porting critically ill patients to designated specialized care centers when
18
1 appropriate. Early treatment and transfer when necessary will save the
2 lives of Idahoans stricken with these emergency conditions. Trauma systems
3 of care are well understood as they have existed in many other states for
4 decades. It is the intent of this legislation the legislature, in sections
5 46-914 through 46-922, Idaho Code, to create an integrated and responsive
6 system of care for Idaho citizens. The trauma component will serve as the
7 initial framework in a deliberate, incremental implementation approach for
8 a comprehensive system of care for time sensitive emergencies in Idaho. The
9 time sensitive emergency system in Idaho is intended to be voluntary and
10 inclusive. The system will be designed such that all facilities, and in
11 particular critical access hospitals, have the opportunity to participate.
12 No facility shall be excluded from receiving medically appropriate patients
13 based solely on the facility's decision of not seeking designation.

8 (k) "TSE system" means the organized approach to treating injured
9 patients that establishes and promotes standards for patient trans-
10 portation, equipment, and information analysis for effective and
11 coordinated TSE care. TSE systems represent a continuum of care that
12 is fully integrated into the emergency medical services system and is a
13 coordinated effort between out-of-hospital and hospital providers with
14 the close cooperation of medical specialists in each phase of care. The
15 focus is on prevention, coordination of acute care, and aggressive re-
16 habilitation. Systems are designed to be inclusive of all patients with
17 a TSE requiring acute care facilities, striving to meet the needs of the
18 patient, regardless of the severity of injury, geographic location, or
19 population density. A TSE system seeks to prevent injuries from happen-
20 ing and the reduction of death and disability when it does happen.

8 the state and local level will lead to improved services and provide op-
9 portunity for continued improvement and cross collaboration for these
10 comparable systems.
11 (2) It is the intent of the Legislature that:
12 (a) The director of the Department of Health and Welfare and the adju-

33 of historical billing information, the applicant must certify that it
34 is currently billing and will continue to bill health insurance carri-
35 ers for at least eighty percent (80%) of eligible services; and

40 have submitted a plan that has been approved by the division that spec-
41 ifies how emergency medical services 911 responses shall be covered and
42 coordinated throughout the entire county.
43 (3) The provision of emergency medical services is a government func-
44 tion. If the division approves applications for sustainability grants
45 pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, counties are authorized and re-
46 quired to ensure that emergency medical services are reasonably available
47 throughout the county.
48 (4) It is the intent of the legislature that counties that accept sus-

38 56-1024 46-914. IDAHO TIME SENSITIVE EMERGENCY SYSTEM OF CARE --
39 STATEMENT OF INTENT. Time sensitive emergencies, specifically blunt trauma
40 injuries, strokes and heart attacks, were three (3) of the top five (5)
41 causes of deaths death in Idaho in 2011. Numerous studies throughout the
42 United States have demonstrated that organized systems of care improve
43 patient outcomes, thus reducing the frequency of preventable death and im-
44 proving the functional status of the patient. The institute of medicine's
45 report "Hospital-Based Emergency Care: At the Breaking Point" recommended
46 improving the care of critical illness through regionalization by trans-
47 porting critically ill patients to designated specialized care centers when

18
1 appropriate. Early treatment and transfer when necessary will save the
2 lives of Idahoans stricken with these emergency conditions. Trauma systems
3 of care are well understood as they have existed in many other states for
4 decades. It is the intent of this legislation the legislature, in sections
5 46-914 through 46-922, Idaho Code, to create an integrated and responsive
6 system of care for Idaho citizens. The trauma component will serve as the
7 initial framework in a deliberate, incremental implementation approach for
8 a comprehensive system of care for time sensitive emergencies in Idaho. The
9 time sensitive emergency system in Idaho is intended to be voluntary and
10 inclusive. The system will be designed such that all facilities, and in
11 particular critical access hospitals, have the opportunity to participate.
12 No facility shall be excluded from receiving medically appropriate patients
13 based solely on the facility's decision of not seeking designation.
14 SECTION 11. That Section 56-1026, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
15 amended to read as follows:

23 other entity performing TSE registry services under a contractual
24 agreement with the division.
25 (c) "Council" means the Idaho time sensitive emergency system council.

31 evation myocardial infarction, a more precise description of a type of
32 heart attack that is caused by a prolonged period of blocked blood sup-

36 (g) "Stroke" means an interruption of blood flow to the brain causing
37 paralysis, slurred speech, or altered brain function usually caused by

39 stroke) or by a blood vessel bursting (hemorrhagic).
40 (h) "Trauma" means the result of an act or event that damages, harms, or
41 hurts a human being resulting in intentional or unintentional damage to

8 (k) "TSE system" means the organized approach to treating injured
9 patients that establishes and promotes standards for patient trans-
10 portation, equipment, and information analysis for effective and

12 is fully integrated into the emergency medical services system and is a
13 coordinated effort between out-of-hospital and hospital providers with
14 the close cooperation of medical specialists in each phase of care. The
15 focus is on prevention, coordination of acute care, and aggressive re-
16 habilitation. Systems are designed to be inclusive of all patients with
17 a TSE requiring acute care facilities, striving to meet the needs of the
18 patient, regardless of the severity of injury, geographic location, or
19 population density. A TSE system seeks to prevent injuries from happen-
20 ing and the reduction of death and disability when it does happen.
