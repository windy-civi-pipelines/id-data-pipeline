15 (c) "Synthetic media" means an audio recording or a video recording of
16 an individual's speech or conduct that has been created through the use
17 of generative adversarial network techniques or other digital technol-
18 ogy in a manner to create a realistic but false audio or video that:
19 (i) Appears to a reasonable individual to be of a real event, ac-
20 tion, or speech that did not actually occur in reality; and
21 (ii) Provides a fundamentally different understanding or impres-
22 sion of the event, action, or speech than a reasonable person would
23 have from the unaltered, original version of the audio recording
24 or video recording.
25 (3) A candidate whose action or speech is deceptively represented
26 through the use of synthetic media in an electioneering communication, ex-
27 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure may seek injunctive or
28 other equitable relief prohibiting the publication of such synthetic media.
29 (4) A candidate whose action or speech is deceptively represented
30 through the use of synthetic media in an electioneering communication, ex-
31 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure may bring an action for
32 general damages, special damages, or both against the information content
33 provider. The court may also award a prevailing party reasonable attorney's
34 fees and costs. The provisions of this subsection do not limit or preclude a
35 plaintiff from securing or recovering any other available remedy.
36 (5) It shall be an affirmative defense for any action brought pursuant
37 to this section that the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
38 candidate, or independent expenditure containing synthetic media includes
39 a disclosure stating, "This (video/audio) has been manipulated" in the fol-
40 lowing manner:
41 (a) If the media is a video, the text of the disclosure must be promi-
42 nently displayed and appear in a size easily readable by the average
43 viewer, and the disclosure must appear for the duration of the video; or
44 (b) If the media consists of audio only, the disclosure must be read in
45 a clearly spoken manner and in a pitch that can be easily heard by the
46 average listener at the beginning of the audio, at the end of the au-
47 dio, and, if the audio is greater than two (2) minutes in length, in-
48 terspersed within the audio at intervals of no more than two (2) minutes
49 each.
15
1 (6) In any action commenced pursuant to this section, the plaintiff
2 bears the burden of establishing the use of synthetic media by clear and
3 convincing evidence.
4 (7) Courts are encouraged to determine matters pursuant to this section
5 expediently.
6 (8) For an action brought pursuant to this section, the information
7 content provider of the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
8 candidate, or independent expenditure may be held liable and not the medium
9 disseminating the electioneering communication, expenditure by a candi-
10 date, or independent expenditure except as provided in subsection (9) of
11 this section.
12 (9) Except when a licensee, programmer, or operator of a federally li-
13 censed broadcasting station transmits an electioneering communication, ex-
14 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure that is subject to 47
15 U.S.C. 315, a medium may be held liable in a cause of action brought pursuant
16 to this section if:
17 (a) The medium removes any disclosure described in subsection (5) of
18 this section from the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
19 candidate, or independent expenditure it disseminates; or
20 (b) Subject to affirmative defenses described in this section, the
21 medium changes the content of an electioneering communication, ex-
22 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure such that it
23 qualifies as synthetic media.
24 (10) No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be
25 treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another
26 information content provider. However, an interactive computer service may
27 be held liable in accordance with subsection (9) of this section.

43 created, vote to authorize such agency to transact business and exer-
44 cise its powers provided for in this chapter. If prior to July 1, 2011,
45 the local governing body has made the findings prescribed in paragraph
46 (a) of this subsection, then such agency shall transact business and
37
1 shall exercise its powers hereunder and is not subject to the require-
2 ments of this paragraph.
3 (2) Upon satisfaction of the requirements under subsection (1) of this
4 section, the urban renewal agency is authorized to transact the business and
5 exercise the powers hereunder by a board of commissioners to be established
6 as follows:
7 (a) Unless provided otherwise in this section, the mayor, by and with
8 the advice and consent of the local governing body, shall appoint a
9 board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency, which shall consist
10 of not less than three (3) commissioners nor more than nine (9) commis-
11 sioners. In the order of appointment, the mayor shall designate the
12 number of commissioners to be appointed, and the term of each, provided
13 that the original term of office of no more than two (2) commissioners
14 shall expire in the same year. The commissioners shall serve for terms
15 not to exceed five (5) years, from the date of appointment, except that
16 all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term.
17 (b) For inefficiency or neglect of duty or misconduct in office, a com-
18 missioner may be removed by a majority vote of the local governing body
19 only after a hearing and after he shall have been given a copy of the
20 charges at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing and have had an op-
21 portunity to be heard in person or by counsel. Any commission position
22 that becomes vacant at a time other than the expiration of a term shall
23 be filled by the mayor or chair of the board of county commissioners, if
24 that is the local governing body, by and with the advice and consent of
25 the local governing body, including the mayor, if applicable, and shall
26 be filled for the unexpired term.
27 (c) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may appoint
28 and designate, from among its members, members of the board of commis-
29 sioners of the urban renewal agency, provided that such representation
30 shall be less than a majority of the board of commissioners of the urban
31 renewal agency of the members of the local governing body on and after
32 July 1, 2017, in which case all the rights, powers, duties, privileges,
33 and immunities vested by the urban renewal law of 1965, and as amended,
34 in an appointed board of commissioners, shall be vested in the local
35 governing body, which shall, in all respects when acting as an urban re-
36 newal agency, be acting as an arm of state government, entirely separate
37 and distinct from the municipality, to achieve, perform, and accomplish
38 the public purposes prescribed and provided by said urban renewal law of
39 1965, and as amended.
40 (d) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may termi-
41 nate the appointed board of commissioners and thereby appoint and des-
42 ignate itself as the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency
43 for not more than one (1) calendar year.
44 (e) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may provide
45 that the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency shall be
46 elected at an election held for such purpose on one (1) of the November
47 dates provided in section 34-106, Idaho Code, and the ordinance may pro-
48 vide term limits for the commissioners. In this case, all the rights,
49 powers, duties, privileges, and immunities vested by the urban renewal
50 law of 1965, and as amended, in an appointed board of commissioners,
38
1 shall be vested in the elected board of commissioners of the urban
2 renewal agency, which shall, in all respects when acting as an urban re-
3 newal agency, be acting as an arm of state government, entirely separate
4 and distinct from the municipality, to achieve, perform, and accomplish
5 the public purposes prescribed and provided by said urban renewal law
6 of 1965, and as amended. The provisions of chapter 66, title 67 3, title
7 74, Idaho Code, shall apply to elected commissioners, and the county
8 election law shall apply to the person running for commissioner as if
9 the person were running for county commissioner. In the event of a
10 vacancy in an elected commissioner position, the replacement shall be
11 appointed by the mayor or chair of the board of county commissioners, if
12 that is the local governing body, by and with the advice and consent of
13 the local governing body, and shall be filled for the unexpired term.
14 (3) In all instances, a member of the board of commissioners of the ur-
15 ban renewal agency must be a resident of the county where the urban renewal
16 agency is located or is doing business.
17 (4) A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his services but
18 shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including travel expenses, in-
19 curred in the discharge of his duties. Each commissioner shall hold office
20 until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of
21 the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the
22 clerk of the municipality and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence
23 of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner.
24 (5)(a) The powers of an urban renewal agency shall be exercised by the
25 commissioners thereof. A majority of the commissioners shall consti-
26 tute a quorum for the purpose of conducting business and exercising the
27 powers of the agency and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by
28 the agency upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, un-
29 less in any case the bylaws shall require a larger number.
30 (b) The commissioners shall elect the chairman, cochairman, or vice
31 chairman for a term of one (1) year from among their members. An agency
32 may employ an executive director, technical experts, and such other
33 agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and
34 determine their qualifications, duties, and compensation. For such
35 legal service as it may require, an agency may employ or retain its own
36 counsel and legal staff.
37 (c) An agency authorized to transact business and exercise powers un-
38 der this chapter shall file, with the local governing body, on or be-
39 fore March 31 of each year a report of its activities for the preced-
40 ing calendar year, which report shall include the financial data and au-
41 dit reports required under sections 67-1075 and 67-1076, Idaho Code.
42 The agency shall be required to hold a public meeting to report these
43 findings and take comments from the public. At the time of filing the
44 report, the agency shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation
45 in the community a notice to the effect that such report has been filed
46 with the municipality and the state controller and that the report is
47 available for inspection during business hours in the office of the city
48 clerk or county recorder, in the office of the agency, and at all times
49 on the website of the state controller.
39
1 (d) An urban renewal agency shall have the same fiscal year as a mu-
2 nicipality and shall be subject to the same audit requirements as a mu-
3 nicipality. An urban renewal agency shall be required to prepare and
4 file with its local governing body an annual financial report and shall
5 prepare, approve, and adopt an annual budget for filing with the local
6 governing body, for informational purposes. A budget means an annual
7 estimate of revenues and expenses for the following fiscal year of the
8 agency.
9 (6) An urban renewal agency shall comply with the public records law
10 pursuant to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, open meetings law pursuant to
11 chapter 2, title 74, Idaho Code, the ethics in government law pursuant to
12 chapter 4, title 74, Idaho Code, and the competitive bidding provisions of
13 chapter 28, title 67, Idaho Code.
14 (7) Upon dissolution of the urban renewal agency, title to all property
15 of the urban renewal agency shall revert to the municipality.

17 by the candidate and be included in the candidate's campaign contribution
18 limits.

20 candidate is not attributed to or reportable by a candidate and must be re-
21 ported by the person making the independent expenditure pursuant to the pro-
22 visions of section 74-3-404, Idaho Code.

31 litical action committee is also the treasurer or any other board member of
32 that political action committee.

44 any race shall be permitted to accept contributions in excess of the contri-
45 bution limits imposed by 74-3-206, Idaho Code, if independent expenditures

47 thousand dollars ($50,000) per election for a candidate for the state leg-

8 and post notice to the online filing system that the candidate is permitted
9 to accept further contributions up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per
10 person, notwithstanding the provisions of section 74-3-206, Idaho Code, in
11 order to respond to the independent expenditures.

11 tem, or access software provider that provides or enables computer ac-
12 cess by multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a

15 (c) "Synthetic media" means an audio recording or a video recording of
16 an individual's speech or conduct that has been created through the use
17 of generative adversarial network techniques or other digital technol-
18 ogy in a manner to create a realistic but false audio or video that:
19 (i) Appears to a reasonable individual to be of a real event, ac-
20 tion, or speech that did not actually occur in reality; and
21 (ii) Provides a fundamentally different understanding or impres-
22 sion of the event, action, or speech than a reasonable person would
23 have from the unaltered, original version of the audio recording
24 or video recording.

26 through the use of synthetic media in an electioneering communication, ex-
27 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure may seek injunctive or
28 other equitable relief prohibiting the publication of such synthetic media.
29 (4) A candidate whose action or speech is deceptively represented
30 through the use of synthetic media in an electioneering communication, ex-
31 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure may bring an action for
32 general damages, special damages, or both against the information content
33 provider. The court may also award a prevailing party reasonable attorney's
34 fees and costs. The provisions of this subsection do not limit or preclude a
35 plaintiff from securing or recovering any other available remedy.
36 (5) It shall be an affirmative defense for any action brought pursuant
37 to this section that the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
38 candidate, or independent expenditure containing synthetic media includes
39 a disclosure stating, "This (video/audio) has been manipulated" in the fol-
40 lowing manner:

42 nently displayed and appear in a size easily readable by the average
43 viewer, and the disclosure must appear for the duration of the video; or
44 (b) If the media consists of audio only, the disclosure must be read in
45 a clearly spoken manner and in a pitch that can be easily heard by the
46 average listener at the beginning of the audio, at the end of the au-
47 dio, and, if the audio is greater than two (2) minutes in length, in-
48 terspersed within the audio at intervals of no more than two (2) minutes
49 each.

15
1 (6) In any action commenced pursuant to this section, the plaintiff
2 bears the burden of establishing the use of synthetic media by clear and
3 convincing evidence.
4 (7) Courts are encouraged to determine matters pursuant to this section
5 expediently.
6 (8) For an action brought pursuant to this section, the information
7 content provider of the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
8 candidate, or independent expenditure may be held liable and not the medium
9 disseminating the electioneering communication, expenditure by a candi-
10 date, or independent expenditure except as provided in subsection (9) of
11 this section.
12 (9) Except when a licensee, programmer, or operator of a federally li-
13 censed broadcasting station transmits an electioneering communication, ex-
14 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure that is subject to 47
15 U.S.C. 315, a medium may be held liable in a cause of action brought pursuant
16 to this section if:
17 (a) The medium removes any disclosure described in subsection (5) of
18 this section from the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
19 candidate, or independent expenditure it disseminates; or
20 (b) Subject to affirmative defenses described in this section, the
21 medium changes the content of an electioneering communication, ex-
22 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure such that it
23 qualifies as synthetic media.
24 (10) No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be
25 treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another
26 information content provider. However, an interactive computer service may
27 be held liable in accordance with subsection (9) of this section.
