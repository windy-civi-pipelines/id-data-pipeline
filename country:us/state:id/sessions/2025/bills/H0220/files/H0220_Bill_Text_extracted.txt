20 tained under this chapter, may submit a medicaid application to the depart-
21 ment of health and welfare. The medical care provided while the person is in
22 protective custody shall be presumed to be medically necessary for purposes
23 of determining reimbursement for that care by third-party payers.
24 (5) Remaining costs for routine medical care shall be apportioned as
25 follows:
26 (a) The department of health and welfare shall pay providers at the rate
27 established by medicaid or its managed care organization. If, based on

31 shall hold a hearing no later than thirty (30) days after the report of the
32 examiner or evaluation committee is filed pursuant to the provisions of sec-
33 tion 20-519A, Idaho Code. At the hearing, the court may receive as evidence
34 the report of the examiner or evaluation committee. In considering whether
35 the juvenile is competent to proceed, the court shall consider the follow-
36 ing:
37 (a) A description of the nature, content, extent and results of the ex-
38 amination and any test that was conducted;
39 (b) The juvenile's capacity to understand the charges or allegations
40 against the juvenile;
41 (c) The juvenile's capacity to understand the range and nature of pos-
42 sible penalties that may be imposed in the proceedings;
43 (d) The juvenile's capacity to understand the adversarial nature of the
44 legal process;
45 (e) The juvenile's capacity to disclose to counsel facts pertinent to

4 tial consequences of not telling the truth;
5 (h) The examiner's opinion as to the competency of the juvenile as de-
6 fined in subsection (2) of section 20-519A, Idaho Code.
7 (2) The weight to be given to each of the factors listed in subsection
8 (1) of this section is discretionary with the court and a determination that
9 the juvenile is or is not competent to proceed may be based on any one (1) or
10 a combination of such factors, which shall be recited in the court's order
11 regarding competency.
12 (3) If neither the prosecuting attorney nor counsel for the juvenile
13 contests the findings of the report of the examiner or evaluation committee,
14 the court may make the determination on the basis of such report. If a party
15 contests the findings of such report, they shall have the right to cross-ex-
16 amine the qualified psychiatrist or licensed psychologist who prepared and
17 submitted the report and to offer evidence upon this issue. A finding of in-
18 competency shall be based upon a preponderance of the evidence.
19 (4) If the court finds the juvenile is competent to proceed, the pro-
20 ceedings shall continue without delay.

23 competency within six (6) months, the court may stay or dismiss the matter.
24 In determining whether to stay or dismiss the matter, the court shall con-
25 sider all relevant factors including, but not limited to, the seriousness of
26 the alleged offense, resources available to the juvenile and any issues of
27 public safety. Prior to a stay or dismissal of the matter, the court may con-
28 vene a screening team consisting of representatives from the department of
29 health and welfare, county probation, local school officials, and/or other
30 agencies or persons designated by the court to develop a treatment plan for
31 the juvenile. In developing such treatment plan, the recommendations con-
32 tained in the competency examination shall be considered to ensure neces-
33 sary services for the juvenile are put into place. Parents and guardians of
34 the juvenile, if available, shall be included in the screening team and con-
35 sulted with regard to the plan of treatment. If appropriate, the court may
36 hold a hearing to determine whether proceedings under chapter 24, title 16,
37 or chapter 3 or 4, title 66, Idaho Code, should be instituted. If such pro-
38 ceedings are initiated, the juvenile court may retain jurisdiction over said
39 proceedings.
40 (6) If the court determines that the juvenile is incompetent to pro-
41 ceed, but may be restored to competency within six (6) months, the court
42 shall order a plan of treatment to be developed by the department of health
43 and welfare for the juvenile to undergo efforts at restoration to compe-
44 tency. The court may:

46 plan of treatment;
47 (b) Order any agencies that have treated or had custody of the juve-

19
1 (c) Order the department of health and welfare, county probation,
2 school officials and the department of juvenile corrections to release
3 all pertinent information regarding the juvenile to the court, the de-
4 partment of health and welfare and any restoration treatment team to be
5 used in the development and implementation of the juvenile's restora-
6 tion plan;
7 (d) Require the parents or guardians of the juvenile, and where ap-
8 propriate require the juvenile, to allow information pertinent to the
9 restoration treatment plan be released to the department of health and
10 welfare, the court and any restoration treatment team.
11 (7) If the court determines that the juvenile is incompetent to pro-
12 ceed, but may be restored to competency, the court may order a juvenile to
13 participate in the competency restoration program as developed by the de-
14 partment of health and welfare. The purpose of the treatment or training is
15 the restoration of the juvenile's competency to proceed. In determining the
16 type and location of the competency restoration program and in designating
17 a restoration provider, the department of health and welfare shall identify
18 the least restrictive alternative that is consistent with public safety and
19 consider whether inpatient treatment, residential care or secure confine-
20 ment is necessary for program participation.
21 (a) An inpatient or residential or secure detention facility is only
22 appropriate if all available less restrictive alternatives in commu-
23 nity settings which would offer an opportunity for improvement of the
24 juvenile's condition are inappropriate. If the department of health
25 and welfare's plan of restoration requires the juvenile be placed in an
26 inpatient, residential or secure detention facility, the court shall
27 hold a hearing on whether to order such placement unless the hearing is
28 waived by the juvenile and the juvenile's parents or guardians. Juve-
29 niles charged with only a status offense or multiple status offenses
30 shall not be held in a secure confinement or detention facility for
31 restoration purposes.
32 (b) The department of health and welfare is responsible for determining
33 the competency restoration program and services. All costs associated
34 with restoration services shall be the responsibility of the parents
35 of the juvenile according to their ability to pay based upon the slid-
36 ing fee scale established pursuant to section 16-2433 39-3140, Idaho
37 Code. The financial obligation of the parents shall be determined after
38 consideration of all available payment and funding sources including
39 title XIX of the social security act, as amended, all available third
40 party sources including funding available to the juvenile from other
41 programs, grants or agencies and parent resources according to any or-
42 der for child support under chapter 10, title 32, Idaho Code. Services
43 shall not be conditioned upon transfer of custody of parental rights.
44 (8) If a juvenile is determined to be incompetent to proceed but may be
45 restored to competency, the court shall retain jurisdiction of the juvenile
46 for up to six (6) months. A restoration order issued pursuant to this section
47 is valid for six (6) months from the date of the initial finding of incompe-
48 tency or until one (1) of the following, whichever occurs first:
49 (a) The restoration program submits a report that the juvenile has be-
50 come competent to proceed or that there is no substantial probability
20
1 that the juvenile will regain competency within the period the order is
2 valid;
3 (b) The charges are dismissed; or
4 (c) The juvenile reaches twenty-one (21) years of age.
5 (9) The court may extend the restoration order beyond six (6) months
6 upon a showing of good cause. If the juvenile reaches twenty-one (21) years
7 of age, the matter shall be dismissed. If the court concludes that there is
8 no substantial probability that the juvenile will regain competency within
9 the period the order is valid, then the provisions of subsection (5) of this
10 section shall apply.
11 SECTION 20. The rules contained in IDAPA 16.07.01, Idaho Department of

33 posed treatment.

35 children provided without consent of the parent of a child, under the au-
36 thority of a court order obtained pursuant to this chapter, as directed by

14 cility of the department or approved by the department. The term "usual
15 and customary treatment costs" shall not include witness fees and expenses
16 for court appearances. Counties shall have no responsibility for costs of
17 voluntary treatment of children under this chapter. Counties shall have
18 no responsibility to pay for the cost of involuntary treatment of children

30 19-2524. CONSIDERATION OF COMMUNITY-BASED TREATMENT TO MEET BEHAV-
31 IORAL HEALTH NEEDS IN SENTENCING AND POST-SENTENCING PROCEEDINGS. (1) After
32 a defendant has pled guilty to or been found guilty of a felony, and at any
33 time thereafter while the court exercises jurisdiction over the defendant,
34 behavioral health needs determinations shall be conducted when and as pro-
35 vided by this section.
36 (a) As part of the presentence process, a screening to determine
37 whether a defendant is in need of a substance use disorder assessment
38 and/or a mental health examination shall be made in every felony case
39 unless the court waives the requirement for a screening. The screening
40 shall be performed within seven (7) days after the plea of guilty or
41 finding of guilt.
42 (b) At any time after sentencing while the court exercises jurisdiction
43 over the defendant, the court may order such a screening to be performed
44 by individuals authorized or approved by the department of correction
45 if the court determines that one is indicated. The screening shall be
46 performed within seven (7) days after the order of the court requiring
47 such screening.

6
1 (2) Substance use disorder provisions.
2 (a) Should a screening indicate the need for further assessment of a
3 substance use disorder, the necessary assessment shall be timely per-
4 formed so as to avoid any unnecessary delay in the criminal proceeding
5 and not later than thirty-five (35) days after a plea of guilty or find-
6 ing of guilt or other order of the court requiring such screening. The
7 assessment may be performed by qualified employees of the department of
8 correction or by private providers approved by the department of health
9 and welfare. If the screening or assessment is not timely completed,
10 the court may order that the screening be performed by another qualified
11 provider.
12 (b) Following completion of the assessment, the results of the assess-
13 ment, including a determination of whether the defendant meets diagnos-
14 tic criteria for a substance use disorder and the recommended level of
15 care, shall be submitted to the court as part of the presentence inves-
16 tigation report or other department of correction report to the court.
17 (c) Following the entry of a plea of guilty or a finding of guilt, the
18 court may order, as a condition of the defendant's continued release on
19 bail or on the defendant's own recognizance, that, if the assessment re-
20 flects that the defendant meets diagnostic criteria for a substance use
21 disorder, the defendant shall promptly, and prior to sentencing, begin
22 treatment at the recommended level of care.
23 (d) If the court concludes at sentencing, or at any time after sentenc-
24 ing while the court exercises jurisdiction over the defendant, that the
25 defendant meets diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder, and
26 if the court places the defendant on probation, the court may order the
27 defendant, as a condition of probation, to undergo treatment at the rec-
28 ommended level of care, subject to modification of the level of care by
29 the court. If substance use disorder treatment is ordered, all treat-
30 ment shall be performed by a qualified private provider approved by the
31 department of health and welfare. The court may order that, if the level
32 of care placement or the treatment plan is modified in any material
33 term, the department of correction shall notify the court stating the
34 reason for the modifications and informing the court as to the clin-
35 ical alternatives available to the defendant. The level of care for
36 substance use treatment shall be based upon on each probationer's risk
37 assessment with priority given to probationers with high or moderate
38 risk levels.
39 (e) In no event shall the persons or facility doing the substance use
40 assessment be the person or facility that provides the substance use
41 treatment unless this requirement is waived by the court or where the
42 assessment and treatment are provided by or through a federally recog-
43 nized Indian tribe or federal military installation where diagnosis and
44 treatment are appropriate and available.
45 (f) Defendants who have completed department of correction institu-
46 tional programs may receive aftercare services from qualified employ-
47 ees of the department of correction.
48 (g) The expenses of all screenings and assessments for substance use
49 disorder provided or ordered under pursuant to this section shall be
50 borne by the department of correction. The expenses for treatment pro-

7
1 vided or ordered under pursuant to this section shall be borne by the
2 department of correction unless the defendant is placed in a treatment
3 program that is funded by an alternate source. The department of cor-
4 rection shall be entitled to any payment received by the defendant or to
5 which he may be entitled from any public or private source available to
6 the department of correction for the service provided to the defendant.
7 The department of correction may promulgate rules for a schedule of fees
8 to be charged to the defendant for the substance use disorder assess-
9 ments and treatments provided to the defendant based upon on the actual
10 costs of such services and the ability of the defendant to pay. The
11 department of correction shall use the state-approved financial eligi-
12 bility form and reimbursement schedule as set forth in IDAPA 16.07.01
13 determine costs pursuant to section 39-3140, Idaho Code.
14 (3) Mental health provisions.
15 (a) Should the mental health screening indicate that a serious mental
16 illness may be present, then the department of correction shall refer
17 the defendant to the department of health and welfare for further exam-
18 ination. The examination shall be timely performed so as to avoid any
19 unnecessary delay in the criminal proceeding and not later than thirty-
20 five (35) days after a plea of guilty or finding of guilt or other order
21 of the court requiring such screening.
22 (b) The examination may be performed by qualified department of health
23 and welfare employees or by private providers under contract with the
24 department of health and welfare, provided that such examination shall
25 at a minimum include an in-depth evaluation of the following:
26 (i) Mental health concerns;
27 (ii) Psychosocial risk factors;
28 (iii) Medical, psychiatric, developmental and other relevant his-
29 tory;
30 (iv) Functional impairments;
31 (v) Mental status examination;
32 (vi) Multiaxial diagnoses; and
33 (vii) Any other examinations necessary to provide the court with
34 the information set forth in paragraph (c) of this subsection.
35 (c) Upon completion of the mental health examination, the court shall
36 be provided, as part of the presentence report or other department of
37 health and welfare report to the court, a copy of the mental health as-
38 sessment along with a summary report. The summary report shall include
39 the following:
40 (i) Description and nature of the examination;

10 hearing is waived by the juvenile or juvenile offender and his or her parents
11 or guardians. The court may order parents, legal guardians or custodians
12 to adhere to the treatment designated in the plan of treatment. Represen-
13 tatives from the department of health and welfare, county probation, local
14 school officials, teen early intervention specialists as provided for under
15 section 16-2404A, Idaho Code, the department of juvenile corrections and/or
16 other agencies or persons designated by the court shall attend case review
17 hearings as scheduled by the court.
18 (5) All costs associated with assessment and treatment shall be the
19 responsibility of the parents of the juvenile or juvenile offender according
20 to their ability to pay based upon the sliding fee scale established pursuant
21 to section 16-2433 39-3140, Idaho Code. The financial obligation of the
22 family shall be determined after consideration of all available payment and
23 funding sources including title XIX of the social security act, as amended,
24 all available third party sources, and parent resources according to any or-
25 der for child support under chapter 10, title 32, Idaho Code. Services shall
26 not be conditioned upon transfer of custody or parental rights.
27 SECTION 19. That Section 20-519B, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
28 amended to read as follows:
29 20-519B. DETERMINATION OF COMPETENCY OF JUVENILE TO PROCEED -- SUS-
30 PENSION OF PROCEEDINGS -- RESTORATION ORDER -- COMMITMENT. (1) The court
31 shall hold a hearing no later than thirty (30) days after the report of the
32 examiner or evaluation committee is filed pursuant to the provisions of sec-
33 tion 20-519A, Idaho Code. At the hearing, the court may receive as evidence
34 the report of the examiner or evaluation committee. In considering whether
35 the juvenile is competent to proceed, the court shall consider the follow-
36 ing:
37 (a) A description of the nature, content, extent and results of the ex-
38 amination and any test that was conducted;
39 (b) The juvenile's capacity to understand the charges or allegations
40 against the juvenile;
41 (c) The juvenile's capacity to understand the range and nature of pos-
42 sible penalties that may be imposed in the proceedings;
43 (d) The juvenile's capacity to understand the adversarial nature of the
44 legal process;
45 (e) The juvenile's capacity to disclose to counsel facts pertinent to
46 the proceedings at issue;
47 (f) Whether the juvenile is able to display appropriate courtroom be-
48 havior;

18
1 (g) Whether the juvenile is able to receive accurate impressions of the
2 facts about which he or she is examined, is able to appreciate the mean-
3 ing of an oath to tell the truth and has an understanding of the poten-
4 tial consequences of not telling the truth;
5 (h) The examiner's opinion as to the competency of the juvenile as de-
6 fined in subsection (2) of section 20-519A, Idaho Code.
7 (2) The weight to be given to each of the factors listed in subsection
8 (1) of this section is discretionary with the court and a determination that
9 the juvenile is or is not competent to proceed may be based on any one (1) or
10 a combination of such factors, which shall be recited in the court's order
11 regarding competency.
12 (3) If neither the prosecuting attorney nor counsel for the juvenile
13 contests the findings of the report of the examiner or evaluation committee,
14 the court may make the determination on the basis of such report. If a party
15 contests the findings of such report, they shall have the right to cross-ex-
16 amine the qualified psychiatrist or licensed psychologist who prepared and
17 submitted the report and to offer evidence upon this issue. A finding of in-
18 competency shall be based upon a preponderance of the evidence.
19 (4) If the court finds the juvenile is competent to proceed, the pro-
20 ceedings shall continue without delay.
21 (5) If the court initially finds that the juvenile is incompetent and
22 there is not a substantial probability that the juvenile will be restored to
23 competency within six (6) months, the court may stay or dismiss the matter.
24 In determining whether to stay or dismiss the matter, the court shall con-
25 sider all relevant factors including, but not limited to, the seriousness of
26 the alleged offense, resources available to the juvenile and any issues of
27 public safety. Prior to a stay or dismissal of the matter, the court may con-
28 vene a screening team consisting of representatives from the department of
29 health and welfare, county probation, local school officials, and/or other
30 agencies or persons designated by the court to develop a treatment plan for
31 the juvenile. In developing such treatment plan, the recommendations con-
32 tained in the competency examination shall be considered to ensure neces-
33 sary services for the juvenile are put into place. Parents and guardians of
34 the juvenile, if available, shall be included in the screening team and con-
35 sulted with regard to the plan of treatment. If appropriate, the court may
36 hold a hearing to determine whether proceedings under chapter 24, title 16,
37 or chapter 3 or 4, title 66, Idaho Code, should be instituted. If such pro-
38 ceedings are initiated, the juvenile court may retain jurisdiction over said
39 proceedings.
40 (6) If the court determines that the juvenile is incompetent to pro-
41 ceed, but may be restored to competency within six (6) months, the court
42 shall order a plan of treatment to be developed by the department of health
43 and welfare for the juvenile to undergo efforts at restoration to compe-
44 tency. The court may:
45 (a) Convene a restoration treatment team to make recommendations on a
46 plan of treatment;
47 (b) Order any agencies that have treated or had custody of the juve-
48 nile to release any pertinent information or records to the department
49 of health and welfare to be used in the development and implementation
50 of the juvenile's restoration plan;

19
1 (c) Order the department of health and welfare, county probation,
2 school officials and the department of juvenile corrections to release
3 all pertinent information regarding the juvenile to the court, the de-
4 partment of health and welfare and any restoration treatment team to be
5 used in the development and implementation of the juvenile's restora-
6 tion plan;
7 (d) Require the parents or guardians of the juvenile, and where ap-
8 propriate require the juvenile, to allow information pertinent to the
9 restoration treatment plan be released to the department of health and
10 welfare, the court and any restoration treatment team.
11 (7) If the court determines that the juvenile is incompetent to pro-
12 ceed, but may be restored to competency, the court may order a juvenile to
13 participate in the competency restoration program as developed by the de-
14 partment of health and welfare. The purpose of the treatment or training is
15 the restoration of the juvenile's competency to proceed. In determining the
16 type and location of the competency restoration program and in designating
17 a restoration provider, the department of health and welfare shall identify
18 the least restrictive alternative that is consistent with public safety and
19 consider whether inpatient treatment, residential care or secure confine-
20 ment is necessary for program participation.
21 (a) An inpatient or residential or secure detention facility is only
22 appropriate if all available less restrictive alternatives in commu-
23 nity settings which would offer an opportunity for improvement of the
24 juvenile's condition are inappropriate. If the department of health
25 and welfare's plan of restoration requires the juvenile be placed in an
26 inpatient, residential or secure detention facility, the court shall
27 hold a hearing on whether to order such placement unless the hearing is
28 waived by the juvenile and the juvenile's parents or guardians. Juve-
29 niles charged with only a status offense or multiple status offenses
30 shall not be held in a secure confinement or detention facility for
31 restoration purposes.
32 (b) The department of health and welfare is responsible for determining
33 the competency restoration program and services. All costs associated
34 with restoration services shall be the responsibility of the parents
35 of the juvenile according to their ability to pay based upon the slid-
36 ing fee scale established pursuant to section 16-2433 39-3140, Idaho
37 Code. The financial obligation of the parents shall be determined after
38 consideration of all available payment and funding sources including
39 title XIX of the social security act, as amended, all available third
40 party sources including funding available to the juvenile from other
41 programs, grants or agencies and parent resources according to any or-
42 der for child support under chapter 10, title 32, Idaho Code. Services
43 shall not be conditioned upon transfer of custody of parental rights.
44 (8) If a juvenile is determined to be incompetent to proceed but may be
45 restored to competency, the court shall retain jurisdiction of the juvenile
46 for up to six (6) months. A restoration order issued pursuant to this section
47 is valid for six (6) months from the date of the initial finding of incompe-
48 tency or until one (1) of the following, whichever occurs first:
49 (a) The restoration program submits a report that the juvenile has be-
50 come competent to proceed or that there is no substantial probability

20
1 that the juvenile will regain competency within the period the order is
2 valid;
3 (b) The charges are dismissed; or
4 (c) The juvenile reaches twenty-one (21) years of age.
5 (9) The court may extend the restoration order beyond six (6) months
6 upon a showing of good cause. If the juvenile reaches twenty-one (21) years
7 of age, the matter shall be dismissed. If the court concludes that there is
8 no substantial probability that the juvenile will regain competency within
9 the period the order is valid, then the provisions of subsection (5) of this
10 section shall apply.
11 SECTION 20. The rules contained in IDAPA 16.07.01, Idaho Department of
12 Health and Welfare, relating to Behavioral Health Sliding Fee Schedules,
13 shall be null, void, and of no force and effect on and after July 1, 2025.

18 SECTION 22. The rules contained in IDAPA 16.07.39, Idaho Department of
19 Health and Welfare, relating to Designated Examiners and Dispositioners,
20 shall be null, void, and of no force and effect on and after July 1, 2025.
