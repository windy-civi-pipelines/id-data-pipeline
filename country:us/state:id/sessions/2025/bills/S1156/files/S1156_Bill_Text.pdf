23 district in which the student is enrolled with verification, as

25 approval by the state board of education, a school district may re-

2
1 dollars ($40,000,000). Any districts receiving reallocations under
2 this paragraph shall not exceed forty million dollars ($40,000,000).

5 tribution based on the average daily attendance of the school.
