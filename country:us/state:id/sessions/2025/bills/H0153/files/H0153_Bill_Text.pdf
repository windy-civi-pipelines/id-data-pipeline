28 and professional licenses as an apprentice. The electrical board may by rule
29 fix the apprentice registration fee, in an amount not to exceed the costs of

24 such other states to grant licenses to electricians licensed by such other
25 states. The administrator, on the recommendation of the Idaho electrical
26 board, may grant licenses to electricians licensed by such other states upon
