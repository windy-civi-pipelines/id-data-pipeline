22 positions on the board or two (2) of the supervisors must first volunteer to

13 tion and must provide a process that allows only qualified electors of the
14 district to vote in that district's election.

16 a declaration of intent as a write-in candidate, it appears that the num-
17 ber of qualified candidates who have been nominated is equal to the number
18 of supervisors to be elected, it shall not be necessary for the candidates to
19 stand for election. The board of supervisors shall declare such candidates
20 elected as supervisors, and the soil and water conservation district shall
21 immediately make and deliver to such persons certificates of election.

34 shall appoint a replacement sufficient to reestablish a quorum of the dis-
35 trict board. The soil conservation district shall issue a certificate of
36 such appointment.

46 22-2727, Idaho Code. A supervisor shall not be provided with retirement ben-
47 efits or health care benefits. Provided, however, that supervisors who are
48 eligible for retirement benefits or health care benefits on the effective
49 date of this act shall continue to receive such benefits until the expiration

41 given in such manner as the commissioners may order, which time, however,
42 shall not be less than fourteen (14) days from the giving of the said notice.
