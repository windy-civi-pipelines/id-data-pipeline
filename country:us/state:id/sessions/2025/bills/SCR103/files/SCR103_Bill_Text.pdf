LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF IDAHO
Sixty-eighth Legislature First Regular Session - 2025
IN THE SENATE
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 103
BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND TAXATION COMMITTEE
1 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
2 STATING FINDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND AUTHORIZING THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
3 TO APPOINT A COMMITTEE TO UNDERTAKE AND COMPLETE A STUDY OF STATE AND LO-
4 CAL LAND USE REGULATIONS AND THE IMPACT ON HOUSING SUPPLY.
5 Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
6 WHEREAS, Idaho's growing population has increased demand for housing,
7 presenting challenges for Idaho residents. The availability of housing is
8 essential to support Idaho's workforce, strengthen communities, and main-
9 tain the State's economic growth; and
10 WHEREAS, rising housing costs and limited housing supply create chal-
11 lenges for many Idahoans. Proactively addressing these issues can help en-
12 sure stable housing options for residents while supporting the State's eco-
13 nomic vitality; and
14 WHEREAS, current land use regulations play a significant role in shap-
15 ing housing development. A thoughtful review of these regulations can iden-
16 tify opportunities to balance oversight with the need to encourage housing
17 production in a cost-effective and efficient manner; and
18 WHEREAS, establishing an interim committee will provide an opportunity
19 for a comprehensive review of local land use regulations and the impact
20 on housing affordability and availability, including evaluation of city
21 comprehensive plans and zoning codes to ensure alignment with Sections
22 67-6502(a) and 67-6508(a), Idaho Code, and the regulatory processes for
23 conditional use permits. The committee will ultimately seek to identify
24 opportunities to reduce regulatory building costs and waiting times and to
25 provide greater flexibility in housing development; and
26 WHEREAS, a better understanding of the effects of land use regula-
27 tions on housing can guide policymakers, developers, and community leaders
28 in identifying practical and effective strategies to improve housing af-
29 fordability while maintaining local control and regulatory integrity.
30 The interim committee's work will promote transparency, collaboration
31 between multiple stakeholders, and accountability, fostering informed de-
32 cision-making; and
33 WHEREAS, Idaho has a unique opportunity to proactively address hous-
34 ing challenges by studying regulatory impacts and developing actionable,
35 locally appropriate solutions. This approach will position the State as a
36 leader in addressing housing affordability while respecting Idaho's values
37 of fiscal responsibility, local control, and reduced red tape.

39 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Rep-
