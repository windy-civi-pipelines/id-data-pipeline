32 (e) In the case of taxes due during the lifetime of a decedent, or by his
33 estate during the period of administration, a notice of deficiency shall be
34 issued, a claim shall be made, the tax shall be assessed, or any proceeding
35 in court without assessment for the collection of such tax shall be begun,
36 within twelve (12) months after written request for prompt action is filed
37 with the state tax commission by the executor, administrator, or other fidu-
38 ciary representing the estate of such decedent. This subsection shall not

50 the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be

6
1 extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of

3 SECTION 4. That Section 63-3045, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
4 amended to read as follows:
5 63-3045. NOTICE OF REDETERMINATION OR DEFICIENCY -- INTEREST.
6 (1)(a) If, in the case of any taxpayer, the state tax commission de-
7 termines that there is a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by
8 this title, the state tax commission shall, immediately upon discovery
9 thereof, send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by first class
10 mail or by other commercial delivery service providing proof of deliv-
11 ery, whichever is the most cost-efficient. The notice shall be sent
12 to the taxpayer's last address known to the state tax commission. The
13 notice of deficiency shall be accompanied by an explanation of the spe-
14 cific reason for the determination and an explanation of the taxpayer's
15 right to appeal. Within sixty-three (63) days after such notice is
16 mailed, the taxpayer may, at his option, file a protest in writing with
17 the state tax commission and obtain redetermination of the deficiency.
18 (b) If the taxpayer files a protest with the state tax commission within
19 the period set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, and such
20 protest does not comply with the rules of the state tax commission and
21 is therefore inadequate to perfect the taxpayer's right to a redetermi-
22 nation of the deficiency determination, then the state tax commission
23 shall notify the taxpayer, in the same manner as set forth in paragraph
24 (a) of this subsection, of such inadequacies, setting forth in said
25 notice the corrective action to be taken by the taxpayer to perfect his
26 protest. The taxpayer shall thereafter have twenty-eight (28) days
27 from the date of said notice to perfect his protest.
28 (c) No assessment of a deficiency in respect to the tax imposed by this
29 chapter, and no distraint or proceedings in court for its collection,
30 shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed
31 to the taxpayer, nor until all appeal rights relating to the deficiency
32 have become final.
33 (2)(a) Following a perfected protest, the taxpayer has the right to
34 an independent administrative redetermination of the originating di-
35 vision's determination before the state tax commission, including a
36 hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to discuss the deficiency de-
37 termination and the taxpayer's protest with a commissioner or duly
38 authorized representative of the commission. The meeting shall be
39 held informally and evidence shall be freely admitted regardless of the
40 rules of evidence.
41 (b) Tax commission staff assigned to the administrative redetermi-
42 nation may not engage in communications relating to the taxpayer's
43 protest with employees of the originating division without first
44 providing the taxpayer the opportunity to participate, except for ques-
45 tions that involve ministerial, administrative or procedural matters
46 that do not address the substance of the issues or positions taken in the
47 case or as otherwise allowed under title 63, Idaho Code, and the rules
48 promulgated thereunder. The state tax commission shall promulgate
49 rules governing communications with the originating division to ensure

7
1 an independent review process. The provisions of this subsection do
2 not create a substantive right affecting the taxpayer's tax liability
3 or the state tax commission's ability to determine, assess or collect
4 that tax liability, including statutory interest and any penalties, if
5 applicable.
6 (3) Any hearing conducted under the provisions of this section may
7 be conducted, in whole or in part, by telephone, television, or other
8 electronic means if each participant in the hearing has an opportunity to
9 participate in the entire proceeding while it is taking place.
10 (4) A taxpayer has the right to be represented by, or be accompanied by,
11 any person of his choice in any proceeding before the tax commission. If the
12 taxpayer is not present at a proceeding, the representative of that taxpayer
13 must be designated in writing by the taxpayer as shall be prescribed in ad-
14 ministrative rules or in any manner acceptable to the tax commission.
15 (5) Following a perfected protest, the taxpayer may submit additional
16 evidence or documentation during the redetermination process subject to the
17 provisions of section 63-3045B(3)(a), Idaho Code.
18 (6) If the taxpayer does not file a protest with the state tax commis-
19 sion within the time prescribed in subsection (1)(a) of this section, the de-
20 ficiency shall be assessed and shall become due and payable upon notice and
21 demand from the state tax commission.
22 (7)(a) Interest shall apply to deficiencies in tax and refunds of tax.
23 Interest shall not apply to any penalty or to unpaid accrued interest.
24 Interest relating to deficiencies or refunds accruing after the origi-
25 nal due date of the return, but not including extensions of the due date,
26 shall be computed on the net of any underpayments and overpayments of a
27 tax liability required to be shown as due on the same return. Interest
28 on deficiencies shall not accrue for any period beginning on the date on
29 which the state tax commission sends written notice that an audit is be-
30 ing initiated identifies a return for possible audit until the date of
31 the issuance of a notice of deficiency determination. Nor shall inter-
32 est on deficiencies accrue for any period between the issuance of a no-
33 tice of deficiency determination that is subject to a perfected protest
34 and the final determination of the deficiency by the state tax commis-
35 sion following the state tax commission's disposition of the protest.
36 (b) Interest upon any deficiency shall be assessed at the same time as
37 the deficiency, shall be due and payable upon notice and demand from
38 the state tax commission and shall be collected as a part of the tax at
39 the rate per annum determined under the provisions of paragraph (c) of
40 this subsection from the date prescribed for the payment of the tax.
41 In the event any of the deficiency is reduced by reason of a carryback
42 of a net operating loss or a capital loss carryback, such reduction in
43 deficiency shall not affect the computation of interest under this sub-
44 section for the period ending with the last day of the taxable year in
45 which the net operating loss or capital loss arises.
46 (c) The rate of interest accruing during any calendar year, or portion
47 thereof, upon any deficiency, or payable upon an overpayment or re-
48 fund, shall be two percent (2%) plus the rate determined under section
49 1274(d), Internal Revenue Code, by the secretary of the treasury of the
50 United States as the midterm federal rate as it applies on September 15

8
1 of the immediately preceding calendar year rounded to the nearest whole
2 number.
3 (8) When the time provisions contained in this section conflict with
4 the provisions of section 63-4208, Idaho Code, relating to the assessment of
5 taxes on illegal possession of controlled substances, the provisions of sec-
6 tion 63-4208, Idaho Code, shall prevail.
7 SECTION 5. That Section 63-3068, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
8 amended to read as follows:

12 posed in this chapter shall be issued within three (3) years from either the
13 due date of the return, without regard to extensions, or from the date the re-
14 turn was filed, whichever is later.
15 (b) If an assessment has been made as provided in this chapter, then
16 such tax shall be collected either by levy, or by a proceeding brought in
17 court, within a period of twelve (12) years from the date of entry of the
18 record of assessment required by section 63-3045A, Idaho Code, of the tax and
19 provided, further, that this shall not be in derogation of any of the reme-
20 dies elsewhere provided in this chapter.
21 (c) In the case of a fraudulent return or a false return with the intent
22 to evade the tax imposed in this chapter, or a willful attempt in any manner
23 to defeat or evade the tax imposed in this chapter, a notice of deficiency may
24 be issued, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for collection of
25 such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time.
26 (d) In the case of a failure to file a return, for any reason, a notice
27 of deficiency may be issued, the tax imposed in this chapter may be assessed,
28 or a proceeding in court for collection of such tax may be begun without as-
29 sessment, at any time, unless the taxpayer had a reasonable belief that no
30 return was required to be filed under this chapter, in which case any defi-
31 ciency, assessment, or proceeding for collection of such tax shall be com-
32 menced within three (3) years of the time the return was due.
33 (e) In the case of income received during the lifetime of a decedent,
34 or by his estate during the period of administration, a notice of deficiency
35 shall be issued, a claim shall be made, the tax shall be assessed or any pro-
36 ceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such tax shall be
37 begun, within twelve (12) months after written request for prompt action is
38 filed with the state tax commission by the executor, administrator, or other
39 fiduciary representing the estate of such decedent. This subsection shall
40 not apply if the return for which the request for prompt action relates has
41 not been filed with the state tax commission.
42 (f) When Idaho taxable income or tax credits for any taxable year have
43 been adjusted as a result of a final federal determination, the period of
44 limitation for issuing a notice of deficiency shall be reopened and shall not
45 expire until the later of one (1) year from the date of delivery of the fi-
46 nal federal determination to the state tax commission by the taxpayer, three
47 (3) years from the due date of the return, without regard to extensions, or
48 three (3) years from the date the return was filed. For purposes of this sub-
49 section the term "final federal determination" shall mean the final resolu-

9
1 tion of all issues which were adjusted by the internal revenue service. When
2 the final federal determination is submitted, the taxpayer shall also submit
3 copies of all schedules and written explanations provided by the internal
4 revenue service. Upon the expiration of the period of limitations as pro-
5 vided in subsections (a) and (m) of this section, only those specific items
6 of income, deductions, gains, losses, or credits which were adjusted in the

11 as provided in this section, affects the amount of tax credit, net operating
12 loss, or capital loss, claimed in a taxable year other than the tax year in
13 which the adjustment is made, then adjustments to the credit, net operating
14 loss, or capital loss claimed in such other tax year may be made and a result-
15 ing notice of deficiency may be issued even though such notice of deficiency
16 would otherwise be barred under the provisions of this section.

18 amended Idaho return is filed within the period of limitations as provided in
19 subsections (a) and (m) of this section, the period of limitations for issu-
20 ing a notice of deficiency shall be three (3) years from the date the amended
21 return was filed. However, upon the expiration of the period of limitations
22 as provided in subsections (a) and (m) of this section, only those specific
23 items of income, deductions, gains, losses, or credits, which were adjusted
24 in the amended Idaho return shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of
25 recomputing Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the ef-
26 fect of such adjustments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.
27 (i) If a taxpayer has filed an amended federal return, and no corre-
28 sponding Idaho amended return has been filed with the state tax commission,
29 then the period of limitations for issuing a notice of deficiency shall be
30 reopened and shall not expire until three (3) years from the date of deliv-
31 ery to the tax commission by the taxpayer of the amended federal return. How-
32 ever, upon the expiration of the period of limitations as provided in subsec-
33 tions (a) and (m) of this section, then only those specific items of income,
34 deductions, gains, losses, or credits, which were adjusted in the amended
35 federal return shall be subject to adjustment for purposes of recomputing
36 Idaho income, deductions, gains, losses, credits, and the effect of such ad-
37 justments on Idaho allocations and apportionments.
38 (j) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, a notice of
39 deficiency, related to items on the return of any pass-through entity, as de-
40 fined in this section, which other taxpayers are required by law to report,
41 shall be issued to such other taxpayers within the later of three (3) years
42 from the due date of the other taxpayers' return, without regard to exten-
43 sions, three (3) years from the date the other taxpayers' returns were filed,
44 or three (3) years from the date of filing of the pass-through entity's re-
45 turn. If the pass-through entity files an amended return, notices of defi-
46 ciency may be issued to the other taxpayers within three (3) years from the
47 date the amended return for the pass-through entity was filed with the state
48 tax commission. If the pass-through entity files an amended return with the
49 internal revenue service, or the internal revenue service issues a final de-
50 termination to the pass-through entity, then the period of limitations for

10
1 issuing a notice of deficiency to the other taxpayers shall be reopened and
2 shall not expire until three (3) years from the date of delivery to the tax
3 commission by the pass-through entity of the amended federal return or the
4 later of one (1) year from the date of delivery to the state tax commission by
5 the pass-through entity of the final federal determination, three (3) years
6 from the due date of the pass-through entity's return, without regard to ex-
7 tensions, or three (3) years from the date the pass-through entity's return
8 was filed.
9 (k) For purposes of this section, "pass-through entity" means a part-
10 nership, S corporation, trust, limited liability company or any other en-
11 tity whose items of income, deductions, gains, losses and credits must be re-
12 ported by other taxpayer(s). For further purposes of this section, the term
13 "other taxpayer" shall include, by way of unlimiting example, such taxpayers
14 as partners, shareholders, beneficiaries, joint venturers or investors.
15 (l) In the case of a duplicate return filed under section 63-217(1)(b),
16 Idaho Code, the limitation under this section shall be the later of one (1)
17 year from the filing of the duplicate return or the date otherwise applicable
18 under this section.
19 (m) Prior to the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for
20 the issuance of a notice of deficiency for the tax imposed in this chapter,
21 both the state tax commission, its delegate or deputy, and the taxpayer may
22 consent in writing to extend the period of time within which a notice of defi-
23 ciency may be issued. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent
24 agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously
25 agreed upon. When a pass-through entity extends the period of limitations
26 in accordance with this subsection, the period of limitations for the other
27 taxpayers is automatically extended for the same period for the purpose of
28 issuing a notice of deficiency to the other taxpayers reflecting the adjust-
29 ments to the pass-through entity's return.
30 (n) The expiration of the period of limitations as provided in this sec-
31 tion shall be suspended for the time period during which the state tax com-
32 mission is prohibited from issuing a notice of deficiency, making the as-
33 sessment, or from collecting by levy or a proceeding in court, and for thirty
34 (30) days thereafter.
35 (o) For the purposes of this section, "return" includes a notice of de-
36 ficiency determination issued by the state tax commission when no return was
37 filed by the taxpayer. Such a return is deemed filed on the date the taxes de-
38 termined by the state tax commission are assessed.

7 sum of the amounts received in the last calendar quarter by each district
8 pursuant to this subsection prior to the consolidation. If a taxing district

10 ously distribute to the board of county commissioners an amount equal to the
