5 (b) Be subject to any disciplinary action, retaliation, or adverse work
6 conditions by any Idaho school or school district for possession of a
7 firearm on school property, unless such school employee fails to comply
8 with the provisions of this section or other Idaho firearms laws.
9 (6) A school employee that has met the school board-specified standards
10 of training and certification and desires to carry a concealed weapon on
11 school property shall inform the principal of the school and superintendent
12 of the school district where he is employed and shall provide them with a
13 copy of the enhanced concealed carry license or the POST training completion
14 certification. The principal and superintendent may share the information
15 with the school board; however, the principal, superintendent, and school
16 board shall maintain the confidentiality of the names of those employees
17 with enhanced concealed carry licenses and the copies of their enhanced
18 concealed carry licenses. The copy of an employee's enhanced concealed
19 carry license or POST training certification shall not be included in the
20 employee's personnel file. Such information shall be shared with all local
21 law enforcement, including the city police department, if applicable, the
22 county sheriff, and the Idaho state police, along with a photo of the school
23 employee in order to assist law enforcement officers in the exercise of
24 their duties. The school employee shall specifically ensure that if a law
25 enforcement school resource officer is assigned to such employee's respec-
26 tive school, such officer is also aware of the employee's possession of an
27 enhanced concealed carry license or POST training certification. In addi-
28 tion to the course of fire and legal classroom curriculum associated with the
29 enhanced concealed carry certification or POST training, it is recommended
30 that a school district offer:
31 (a) Recurrent active shooter refresher training with the district's
32 armed concealed carry employees and local police agencies or sheriff's
33 offices; and
34 (b) A range qualification day at least twice a year to enhance and en-
35 sure ongoing proper handling, accuracy, and proficiency.
36 (7) Nothing in subsection (4) of this section shall limit the right of
37 an owner of private property, including a private school, from permitting or
38 prohibiting the carrying of a concealed firearm or other deadly weapon on his
39 property.
40 (8) No cause of action shall lie or be maintained for civil damages in
41 any court of this state against a school, school district, or school employee
42 where the claim arises out of the lawful possession, lawful action, lawful
43 use, or nonuse of a deadly weapon by a school employee on school property and
44 who does so without the consent of the board but in accordance with subsec-
45 tion (4)(h) of this section.
46 (9) No public school shall display any signage whatsoever indicating
47 that school property is a gun-free zone.
48 (10) No school employee shall be required to carry a concealed weapon on
49 school property without his consent. No school employee shall have the duty
50 arising from this section to carry or use a deadly weapon on school property.

5
1 (11) No school employee shall be held civilly or criminally liable for
2 deciding to engage or not to engage in an armed confrontation with an active
3 shooter as long as the school employee's actions are lawful and in accordance
4 with laws pertaining to self-defense and the defense of others who are in
5 life-threatening immediate harm or danger. The decision to use a firearm or
6 other deadly weapon during a life-threatening incident inside of a school
7 or on school property shall lie solely within the school employee and shall
8 be a personal decision. The mere possession of a firearm and enhanced con-
9 cealed carry license alone shall not mandate that a school employee take
10 armed action. If the armed school employee does engage an armed assailant,
11 the armed employee shall be responsible for any and all bullet projectiles
12 the employee fires with his firearm. School employees who decide to carry a
13 concealed firearm on school property may consider:
14 (a) What is in the background of an armed assailant in the event the em-
15 ployee fires his weapon;
16 (b) That it is a certainty that active shooter incidents or other armed
17 incidents that occur within a school are always dynamic and rapidly
18 evolving;
19 (c) That school employees who decide to carry a concealed firearm on
20 school property must accept the responsibility freely and voluntarily
21 while also ensuring they understand the various potential variables
22 they could be faced with; and
23 (d) That the decision to carry a concealed firearm in a school setting
24 comes with a huge responsibility, and the personal responsibility un-
25 dertaken cannot be understated.
26 (5) (12) Penalties. Persons who are found guilty of violating the pro-
27 visions of this section may be sentenced to a jail term of not more than one
28 (1) year or fined an amount not in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or
29 both. If a violator is a student and under the age of eighteen (18) years,
30 the court may place the violator on probation and suspend the juvenile deten-
31 tion or fine or both as long as the violator is enrolled in a program of study
32 recognized by the court that, upon successful completion, will grant the vi-
33 olator a general equivalency diploma (GED) or a high school diploma or other
34 educational program authorized by the court. Upon successful completion of
35 the terms imposed by the court, the court shall discharge the offender from
36 serving the remainder of the sentence. If the violator does not complete, is
37 suspended from, or otherwise withdraws from the program of study imposed by
38 the court, the court, upon receiving such information, shall order the vio-
39 lator to commence serving the sentence provided for in this section.
