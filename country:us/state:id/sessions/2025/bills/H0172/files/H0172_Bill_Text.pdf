4 DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.
5 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
6 SECTION 1. That Section 74-204, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
7 amended to read as follows:
8 74-204. NOTICE OF MEETINGS -- AGENDAS. (1) Regular meetings. No less
9 than a five (5) calendar day meeting notice and a forty-eight (48) hour
10 agenda notice shall be given unless otherwise provided by statute. Provided
11 however, that any public agency that holds meetings at regular intervals of
12 at least once per calendar month scheduled in advance over the course of the
13 year may satisfy this meeting notice by giving meeting notices at least once
14 each year of its regular meeting schedule. The notice requirement for meet-
15 ings and agendas shall be satisfied by posting such notices and agendas in a
16 prominent place at the principal office of the public agency or, if no such
17 office exists, at the building where the meeting is to be held. The notice
18 for meetings and agendas shall also be posted electronically if the entity
19 maintains an online presence through a website or a social media platform.
20 (2) Special meetings. No special meeting shall be held without at least
21 a twenty-four (24) hour meeting and agenda notice, unless an emergency ex-
22 ists. An emergency is a situation involving injury or damage to persons or
23 property, or immediate financial loss, or the likelihood of such injury,
24 damage or loss, when the notice requirements of this section would make such
25 notice impracticable or increase the likelihood or severity of such injury,
26 damage or loss, and the reason for the emergency is stated at the outset of
27 the meeting. The notice required under this section shall include at a min-
28 imum the meeting date, time, place and name of the public agency calling for
29 the meeting. The secretary or other designee of each public agency shall
30 maintain a list of the news media requesting notification of meetings and
31 shall make a good faith effort to provide advance notification to them of the
32 time and place of each meeting.
33 (3) Executive sessions. If only an executive session will be held, a
34 twenty-four (24) hour meeting and agenda notice shall be given according
35 to the notice provisions stated in subsection (2) of this section and shall
36 state the reason and the specific provision of law authorizing the executive
37 session.
38 (4) An agenda shall be required for each meeting. The agenda shall be
39 posted in the same manner as the notice of the meeting. An agenda may be
40 amended, provided that a good faith effort is made to include, in the orig-
41 inal agenda notice, all items known to be probable items of discussion. An
42 agenda item that requires a vote shall be identified on the agenda as an "ac-

2
1 tion item" to provide notice that action may be taken on that item. Multiple
2 agenda items may be grouped together and voted upon as a single action item
3 known as a consent agenda, provided the agenda items are not ordinances, fee
4 resolutions, or items requiring more than a simple majority of the members
5 present. During the meeting, if any member of the governing body requests an
6 item or items be removed from the consent agenda, such item or items shall,
7 prior to the vote on the consent agenda, be removed from the consent agenda
8 and considered as a separate action for discussion and vote. Identifying an
9 item as an action item on the agenda does not require a vote to be taken on
10 that item.
11 (a) If an amendment to an agenda is made after an agenda has been posted
12 but forty-eight (48) hours or more prior to the start of a regular meet-
13 ing, or twenty-four (24) hours or more prior to the start of a special
14 meeting, then the agenda is amended upon the posting of the amended
15 agenda.
16 (b) If an amendment to an agenda is proposed after an agenda has been
17 posted and less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to a regular meeting
18 or less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to a special meeting but prior
19 to the start of the meeting, the proposed amended agenda shall be posted
20 but shall not become effective until a motion is made at the meeting and
21 the governing body votes to amend the agenda.
22 (c) An agenda may be amended after the start of a meeting upon a motion
23 that states the reason for the amendment and states the good faith rea-
24 son the agenda item was not included in the original agenda posting. Fi-
25 nal action may not be taken on an agenda item added after the start of
26 a meeting unless an emergency is declared necessitating action at that
27 meeting. The declaration and justification shall be reflected in the
28 minutes.
29 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
30 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
31 July 1, 2025.
