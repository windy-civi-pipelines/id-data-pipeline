33 employee from being in the presence of minors or students, preventing
34 the employee from being in the presence of any other adult individual
35 employed at the school or detaining the employee in prison or jail, the
36 certificated employee's involuntary leave of absence shall be without
37 pay due to the certificated employee's inability to perform the essen-
38 tial functions of the employee's position. Without such a condition or
39 situation, the involuntary leave of absence shall be with pay.
40 (i) During the period of involuntary leave of absence without
41 pay, the salary of the certificated employee will be maintained

4 trict shall continue to pay the district's portion of monthly

6 ance benefits. The assumption of this payment by the district

8 tions, if any, under the policy.
9 (b) Should there be dual court orders preventing more than one (1) em-
10 ployee from being in the presence of one (1) or more other employees, all
11 employees subject to the court order shall be excluded from the school
12 pursuant to subsection 7.(a) of this section paragraph (a) of this sub-
13 section.
14 (c) If the period of involuntary leave of absence is due to the dis-
15 trict's need to conduct an investigation into the conduct of the cer-
16 tificated employee, and there are no related criminal investigation(s)
