22 claims, or mineral rights in the state of Idaho. This subsection does not
23 apply to any interest in agricultural land, forest land, water rights, min-

31 land, mining claims, or mineral rights on or after July 1, 2025, by devise or
32 descent, through the enforcement of security interests, or through the col-
33 lection of debts, provided that the foreign principal sells, transfers, or
34 otherwise divests itself of the agricultural land, mining claims, or mineral
35 rights within one hundred eighty (180) days of acquiring the agricultural
36 land, mining claims, or mineral rights.
37 (8) The provisions of subsections (3) through (7) of this section shall
38 not apply to an entity that has a national security agreement with the com-
39 mittee on foreign investment in the United States as of July 1, 2025, and
40 maintains such national security agreement.

42 agreements in conflict with this law shall be deemed invalid from the date of
43 adoption unless otherwise provided.

19 tion, the whistleblower shall be entitled to a reward equal to thirty percent
20 (30%) of the proceeds of the land, mining claims, mineral rights, or asset
