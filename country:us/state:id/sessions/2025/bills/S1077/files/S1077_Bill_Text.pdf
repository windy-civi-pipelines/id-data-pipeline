15 18-622. DEFENSE OF LIFE ACT. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2)
16 of this section, every person who performs or attempts to perform an abortion
17 as defined in this chapter commits the crime of criminal abortion. Crimi-
18 nal abortion shall be a felony punishable by a sentence of imprisonment of no
19 less than two (2) years and no more than five (5) years in prison. The profes-
20 sional license of any health care professional who performs or attempts to
21 perform an abortion or who assists in performing or attempting to perform an
22 abortion in violation of this subsection shall be suspended by the appropri-
23 ate licensing board for a minimum of six (6) months upon a first offense and
24 shall be permanently revoked upon a subsequent offense.
25 (2) The following shall not be considered criminal abortions for pur-
26 poses of subsection (1) of this section:
27 (a) The abortion was performed or attempted by a physician as defined in
28 this chapter and:
29 (i) The physician determined, in his good faith medical judgment
30 and based on the facts known to the physician at the time, that the
31 abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.
32 No abortion shall be deemed necessary to prevent the death of the
33 pregnant woman because the physician believes that the woman may
34 or will take action to harm herself; and
35 (ii) The physician performed or attempted to perform the abortion
36 in the manner that, in his good faith medical judgment and based
37 on the facts known to the physician at the time, provided the best
38 opportunity for the unborn child to survive, unless, in his good
39 faith medical judgment, termination of the pregnancy in that man-
40 ner would have posed a greater risk of the death of the pregnant
41 woman. No such greater risk shall be deemed to exist because the
42 physician believes that the woman may or will take action to harm
43 herself; or
44 (b) The abortion was performed or attempted by a physician as defined
45 in this chapter during the first trimester of pregnancy, the physician
46 provided the woman with copies of the informed consent printed mate-
47 rial described in section 18-609, Idaho Code, at least twenty-four (24)
48 hours prior to the performance of the abortion, and:

4
1 (i) If the woman is not a minor or subject to a guardianship, then,
2 prior to the performance of the abortion, the woman has reported to
3 a law enforcement agency that she is the victim of an act of rape or
4 incest and provided a copy of such report to the physician who is
5 to perform the abortion. The copy of the report shall remain a con-
6 fidential part of the woman's medical record subject to applicable
7 privacy laws; or
8 (ii) If the woman is a minor or subject to a guardianship, then,
9 prior to the performance of the abortion, the woman or her parent
10 or guardian has reported to a law enforcement agency or child pro-
11 tective services that she is the victim of an act of rape or incest
12 and a copy of such report has been provided to the physician who is
13 to perform the abortion. The copy of the report shall remain a con-
14 fidential part of the woman's medical record subject to applicable
15 privacy laws.
16 (3) If a report concerning an act of rape or incest is made to a law en-
17 forcement agency or child protective services pursuant to subsection (2)(b)
18 of this section, then the person who made the report shall, upon request, be
19 entitled to receive a copy of such report within seventy-two (72) hours of
20 the report being made, provided that the report may be redacted as necessary
21 to avoid interference with an investigation.
22 (4) Medical treatment provided to a pregnant woman by a health care pro-
23 fessional as defined in this chapter that results in the accidental death of,
24 or unintentional injury to, the unborn child shall not be a violation of this
25 section.
26 (5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to subject a pregnant
27 woman on whom any abortion is performed or attempted to any criminal convic-
28 tion and penalty.
29 SECTION 3. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
30 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
31 July 1, 2025.
