12 amended to read as follows:
13 50-3101. PURPOSE, RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER LAWS AND SHORT TITLE. (1)
14 The purpose of this chapter is:
15 (a) To encourage the funding and construction of regional community in-
16 frastructure in advance of actual developmental growth that creates the
17 need for such additional infrastructure;
18 (b) To provide a means for the advance payment of development impact
19 fees established in chapter 82, title 67, Idaho Code, and the community
20 infrastructure that may be financed thereby; and
21 (c) To create additional financial tools and financing mechanisms that
22 allow new growth to more expediently pay for itself.
23 (2) Only community infrastructure to be publicly owned by this state or
24 a political subdivision thereof may be financed pursuant to this chapter.
25 (3) A community infrastructure district may only be formed pursuant to
26 this chapter only by a city in the city's incorporated area, or by a county
27 in an area contained within a city's comprehensive plan with the city's con-
28 sent, or by a county when the district is outside of a city's comprehensive
29 plan.
30 (4) A community infrastructure district may be formed only after (i)
31 prior review and approval by the governing body of each county or city in
32 which the district is proposed to be located of a petition requesting the
33 formation of the district, and (ii) the necessary approvals for site de-
34 velopment under the local land use planning act, sections 67-6501 et seq.,
35 Idaho Code, and the planning and zoning ordinances of each county and city
36 in which the district is proposed to be located have been obtained; provided
37 however, that where there will be phased development, approvals obtained
38 for the first phase of site development shall be sufficient for the initial
39 creation and organization of the district. The formation of a district
40 pursuant to this chapter shall not prevent the exercise by a county, city
41 or other political subdivision of any of its powers on the same basis as on
42 all other land within its jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the formation of a

2
1 district, the development of real property located within the district shall
2 remain subject to the provisions of chapter 65, title 67, Idaho Code, and
3 the applicable planning and zoning ordinances of the counties and cities in
4 which the district is located. The formation of a district pursuant to this
5 chapter shall not prevent the subsequent establishment of other districts or
6 the improvement or assessment of land within the district by a county, city
7 or other political subdivision.
8 (5) This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Community In-
9 frastructure District Act."
10 SECTION 2. That Section 50-3102, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby

37 porary assessment are provided in the district development agreement.
38 (2) A temporary assessment under this section shall be imposed on each

40 the transfer of title to the first residential homeowner. Notwithstanding
41 any provision of law to the contrary, the district shall be exempt from pro-
42 viding public notice when a temporary assessment is imposed on a property
43 for the first time; provided that the existence, terms, and any applicable
44 amounts of the assessment shall be disclosed in the property disclosure no-
45 tice and shall be signed and acknowledged by any purchaser prior to purchase.
46 The obligation to pay the temporary assessment shall run with the property,
47 and any subsequent owner who acquires title within the original five (5) year
48 assessment period shall be responsible for payment of the assessment for the

2 sessment shall expire at the end of the five (5) year term without further no-
3 tice or action. Upon the expiration of the assessment for a property as pro-
4 vided in this section, the district shall have no further authority to levy
5 an assessment under this section on that same property.

7 increases shall be as set forth in the district development agreement, pro-
8 vided that the amount of the temporary assessment shall not increase by more
9 than two percent (2%) in any year.

12 counted for under the laws of this state. All revenues from the temporary as-
13 sessment shall be kept separate from other district funds in a dedicated fund
14 and may accumulate from year to year to ensure the availability of moneys to
15 pay for or offset the costs of fire protection services and emergency medical
16 services as authorized in this section.

18 to pay for or offset the costs of fire protection services and emergency med-
19 ical services for the district. Permissible expenditures shall include but

21 nel and emergency medical services personnel; procurement, maintenance, re-
22 pair, or replacement of fire protection services or emergency medical ser-
