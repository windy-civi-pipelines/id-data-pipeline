28 amended to read as follows:
29 50-2006. URBAN RENEWAL AGENCY -- AUTHORIZATION -- DISSOLUTION.
30 (1)(a) There is hereby created in each municipality an independent pub-
31 lic body corporate and politic to be known as the "urban renewal agency"
32 that was created by resolution as provided in section 50-2005, Idaho
33 Code, before July 1, 2011, for the municipality; provided, that such
34 agency shall not transact any business or exercise its powers hereunder
35 until or unless the local governing body has made the findings pre-
36 scribed in section 50-2005, Idaho Code.
37 (b) An urban renewal agency created after July 1, 2011, shall not trans-
38 act any business or exercise its powers provided for in this chapter
39 until a majority of qualified electors, voting in a citywide or coun-
40 tywide election, depending on the municipality in which such agency is
41 created, vote to authorize such agency to transact business and exer-
42 cise its powers provided for in this chapter. If prior to July 1, 2011,

2
1 the local governing body has made the findings prescribed in paragraph
2 (a) of this subsection, then such agency shall transact business and
3 shall exercise its powers hereunder and is not subject to the require-
4 ments of this paragraph.
5 (2) Upon satisfaction of the requirements under subsection (1) of this
6 section, the urban renewal agency is authorized to transact the business and
7 exercise the powers hereunder by a board of commissioners to be established
8 as follows:
9 (a) Unless provided otherwise in this section, the mayor, by and with
10 the advice and consent of the local governing body, shall appoint a
11 board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency, which shall consist
12 of not less than three (3) commissioners nor more than nine (9) commis-
13 sioners. In the order of appointment, the mayor shall designate the
14 number of commissioners to be appointed, and the term of each, provided
15 that the original term of office of no more than two (2) commissioners
16 shall expire in the same year. The commissioners shall serve for terms
17 not to exceed five (5) years, from the date of appointment, except that
18 all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term.
19 (b) For inefficiency or neglect of duty or misconduct in office, a com-
20 missioner may be removed by a majority vote of the local governing body
21 only after a hearing and after he shall have been given a copy of the
22 charges at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing and have had an op-
23 portunity to be heard in person or by counsel. Any commission position
24 that becomes vacant at a time other than the expiration of a term shall
25 be filled by the mayor or chair of the board of county commissioners, if
26 that is the local governing body, by and with the advice and consent of
27 the local governing body, including the mayor, if applicable, and shall
28 be filled for the unexpired term.
29 (c) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may appoint
30 and designate, from among its members, members of the board of commis-
31 sioners of the urban renewal agency, provided that such representation
32 shall be less than a majority of the board of commissioners of the urban
33 renewal agency of the members of the local governing body on and after
34 July 1, 2017, in which case all the rights, powers, duties, privileges,
35 and immunities vested by the urban renewal law of 1965, and as amended,
36 in an appointed board of commissioners, shall be vested in the local
37 governing body, which shall, in all respects when acting as an urban re-
38 newal agency, be acting as an arm of state government, entirely separate
39 and distinct from the municipality, to achieve, perform, and accomplish
40 the public purposes prescribed and provided by said urban renewal law of
41 1965, and as amended.
42 (d) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may termi-
43 nate the appointed board of commissioners and thereby appoint and des-
44 ignate itself as the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency
45 for not more than one (1) calendar year.
46 (e) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may provide
47 that the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency shall be
48 elected at an election held for such purpose on one (1) of the November
49 dates provided in section 34-106, Idaho Code, and the ordinance may pro-
50 vide term limits for the commissioners. In this case, all the rights,

3
1 powers, duties, privileges, and immunities vested by the urban renewal
2 law of 1965, and as amended, in an appointed board of commissioners,
3 shall be vested in the elected board of commissioners of the urban
4 renewal agency, which shall, in all respects when acting as an urban re-
5 newal agency, be acting as an arm of state government, entirely separate
6 and distinct from the municipality, to achieve, perform, and accomplish
7 the public purposes prescribed and provided by said urban renewal law
8 of 1965, and as amended. The provisions of chapter 66, title 67, Idaho
9 Code, shall apply to elected commissioners, and the county election law
10 shall apply to the person running for commissioner as if the person were
11 running for county commissioner. In the event of a vacancy in an elected
12 commissioner position, the replacement shall be appointed by the mayor
13 or chair of the board of county commissioners, if that is the local gov-
14 erning body, by and with the advice and consent of the local governing
15 body, and shall be filled for the unexpired term.
16 (3) In all instances, a member of the board of commissioners of the ur-
17 ban renewal agency must be a resident of the county where the urban renewal
18 agency is located or is doing business.
19 (4) A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his services but
20 shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including travel expenses, in-
21 curred in the discharge of his duties. Each commissioner shall hold office
22 until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of
23 the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the
24 clerk of the municipality and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence
25 of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner.
26 (5)(a) The powers of an urban renewal agency shall be exercised by the
27 commissioners thereof. A majority of the commissioners shall consti-
28 tute a quorum for the purpose of conducting business and exercising the
29 powers of the agency and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by
30 the agency upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, un-
31 less in any case the bylaws shall require a larger number.
32 (b) The commissioners shall elect the chairman, cochairman, or vice
33 chairman for a term of one (1) year from among their members. An agency
34 may employ an executive director, technical experts, and such other
35 agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and
36 determine their qualifications, duties, and compensation. For such
37 legal service as it may require, an agency may employ or retain its own
38 counsel and legal staff.
39 (c) An agency authorized to transact business and exercise powers un-
40 der this chapter shall file, with the local governing body, on or be-
41 fore March 31 of each year a report of its activities for the preced-
42 ing calendar year, which report shall include the financial data and au-
43 dit reports required under sections 67-1075 and 67-1076, Idaho Code.
44 The agency shall be required to hold a public meeting to report these
45 findings and take comments from the public. At the time of filing the
46 report, the agency shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation
47 in the community a notice to the effect that such report has been filed
48 with the municipality and the state controller and that the report is
49 available for inspection during business hours in the office of the city

4
1 clerk or county recorder, in the office of the agency, and at all times
2 on the website of the state controller.
3 (d) An urban renewal agency shall have the same fiscal year as a mu-
4 nicipality and shall be subject to the same audit requirements as a mu-
5 nicipality. An urban renewal agency shall be required to prepare and
6 file with its local governing body an annual financial report and shall
7 prepare, approve, and adopt an annual budget for filing with the local
8 governing body, for informational purposes. A budget means an annual
9 estimate of revenues and expenses for the following fiscal year of the
10 agency.
11 (6) An urban renewal agency shall comply with the public records law
12 pursuant to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, open meetings law pursuant to
13 chapter 2, title 74, Idaho Code, the ethics in government law pursuant to
14 chapter 4, title 74, Idaho Code, and the competitive bidding provisions of
15 chapter 28, title 67, Idaho Code.
16 (7) A local governing body that has created an urban renewal agency may
17 dissolve the urban renewal agency by the enactment of an ordinance as pro-
18 vided in this subsection. Before such local governing body may dissolve an
19 urban renewal agency, it shall adopt a resolution of intent to dissolve the
20 urban renewal agency, which resolution shall be transmitted to the urban re-
21 newal agency. Upon the adoption of the resolution of intent to dissolve,
22 the urban renewal agency shall no longer have any authority to initiate any
23 new urban renewal projects or to take on any additional financial obliga-
24 tions other than such obligations as are necessary to wind down its affairs.
25 The local governing body and the board of commissioners of the urban renewal
26 agency shall then participate in a joint meeting to discuss dissolution. If
27 following the joint meeting the local governing body of an authorized munic-
28 ipality makes a finding that there no longer exists a need for the urban re-
29 newal agency in the municipality, the local governing body shall provide, by
30 ordinance, for a dissolution of the agency. The ordinance shall be effec-
31 tive upon publication. The ordinance shall be recorded in the real property
32 records of the county in which the agency operated. The local governing body
33 shall transmit a copy of the recorded dissolution ordinance to the urban re-
34 newal agency, the county clerk, and the state tax commission within ten (10)
35 business days of the recording date. Upon dissolution of the urban renewal

7 assessment valuation of the taxable property in a revenue allocation area
8 as shown upon the base assessment roll shall be reduced by the amount by

10 exceeds the current equalized assessed valuation of any taxable property
11 located in the revenue allocation area and by the equalized assessed val-
12 uation of taxable property in such revenue allocation area that becomes
13 exempt from taxation subsequent to the date of the base assessment roll.
14 The equalized assessed valuation of the taxable property in a revenue allo-
15 cation area as shown on the base assessment roll shall be increased by the
16 equalized assessed valuation, as of the date of the base assessment roll, of

49 notifying the local governing body, the county auditor, and the state tax
50 commission and recommending the adoption of an ordinance for termination of

6

37 location area. The urban renewal agency shall be required annually to
38 attest to having or not having modified any of its plans. If no modifi-
39 cation has occurred, the urban renewal agency shall attest that fact on
40 an affidavit provided by the state tax commission before the first Mon-
41 day in June of each year. Modification shall not be deemed to have oc-
42 curred when:
43 (i) There is a plan amendment to make technical or ministerial
44 changes to a plan that does not involve an increase in the use of
45 revenues allocated to the agency pursuant to section 50-2908,
46 Idaho Code; or
47 (ii) There is a plan amendment to accommodate an increase in the
48 revenue allocation area boundary as permitted in section 50-2033,
49 Idaho Code; or

10
1 (iii) There is a plan amendment to accommodate a de-annexation in
2 the revenue allocation area boundary; or
3 (iv) There is a plan amendment to support growth or development of
4 an existing a commercial, manufacturing, or industrial project in
5 an existing revenue allocation area, subject to the provisions of
6 section 50-2905A, Idaho Code.
7 (b) Notice of any plan modification shall state the nature of the mod-
8 ification and shall be provided to the state tax commission, the county
9 clerk and the county assessor by the first Monday in June of the years
10 following the modification.
11 (c) Once a modification is deemed to have occurred, the base assessment
12 value shall be reset pursuant to this subsection.
13 (2) When the urban renewal agency certifies to the county clerk and
14 state tax commission that there is outstanding indebtedness, the base value
15 for the year immediately following the year in which the modification oc-
16 curred shall be computed and adjusted irrespective of the modification to
17 the plan, but in compliance with all other requirements for adjustment as
18 provided in section 50-2903(4), Idaho Code. To be allowed this exception no
19 later than the first Monday in June each year, beginning the year immediately
20 following the year in which the modification occurred, the urban renewal
21 agency must certify:
22 (a) That the indebtedness could not be repaid by the agency prior to
23 the termination of the revenue allocation area without the allocation
24 of property tax revenues as provided in section 50-2908, Idaho Code; and
25 (b) The estimated total budget to be used for paying indebtedness dur-
26 ing each year until termination of the revenue allocation area, the
27 amount of nonproperty tax revenue to be used by the agency to pay indebt-
28 edness each year, and the estimated amount of revenue to be allocated to
29 the agency for the modified revenue allocation area pursuant to section
30 50-2908, Idaho Code, to be used for paying indebtedness. For purposes
31 of this section "indebtedness" shall mean any bonds, including refund-
32 ing bonds, notes, interim certificates, certificates of indebtedness,
33 debentures or other obligations, together with all expenses necessary
34 to comply with all covenants related to the indebtedness.
35 (3) To the extent the amount of revenue allocated to the modified rev-
36 enue allocation area pursuant to section 50-2908, Idaho Code, exceeds the
37 amount necessary to pay indebtedness certified in subsection (2)(b) of this
38 section, the excess shall be distributed by the county clerk to each taxing
39 district or unit in the same manner as property taxes, except that each tax-
40 ing district or unit shall be notified of the amount of any distribution of
41 excess urban renewal allocations included in any distribution. For purposes
42 of the limitation provided by section 63-802, Idaho Code, moneys received by
43 any taxing district or unit pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as
44 property tax revenue.
45 (4) Within thirty (30) days from the time the state tax commission re-
46 ceives information that an urban renewal plan for a revenue allocation area
47 has been modified, the state tax commission shall notify the urban renewal
48 agency and the county clerk of such receipt and the determination regarding
49 any limits on the maximum amount of property tax revenue that will be allo-
50 cated to the urban renewal agency from the current year's property taxes.

1 SECTION 4. That Section 50-2904, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
2 amended to read as follows:
3 50-2904. AUTHORITY TO CREATE REVENUE ALLOCATION AREA. An authorized
4 municipality is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt, at any time, a
5 revenue allocation financing provision, as described in this chapter, as
6 part of an urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border com-
7 munity area ordinance. A revenue allocation financing provision may be
8 adopted either at the time of the original adoption of an urban renewal plan
9 or the creation by ordinance of a competitively disadvantaged border com-
10 munity area or thereafter as a modification of an urban renewal plan or the
11 ordinance creating the competitively disadvantaged border community area.
12 Urban renewal plans existing prior to the effective date of this section may
13 be modified to include a revenue allocation financing provision. Except
14 as provided in subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4), and (5) of this section,
15 no revenue allocation provision of an urban renewal plan or competitively
16 disadvantaged border community area ordinance, including all amendments
17 thereto, shall have a duration exceeding twenty (20) years from the date
18 the ordinance is approved by the municipality; and provided further, no
19 additions to the land area of an existing revenue allocation area shall be
20 interpreted to or shall cause an extension of the date of the twenty (20)
21 year limit that was originally established for the revenue allocation area.
22 Notwithstanding these limitations, the duration of the revenue allocation
23 financing provision may be extended if:
24 (1) The maturity date of any bonds issued to provide funds for a spe-
25 cific project in the revenue allocation area and payable from the revenue al-
26 location financing provision exceeds the duration of the revenue allocation
27 financing provision, provided such bond maturity is not greater than twenty
28 (20) years; or
29 (2) The urban renewal agency determines that it is necessary to refi-
30 nance outstanding bonds payable from the revenue allocation financing pro-
31 vision to a maturity exceeding the twenty (20) year duration of the revenue
32 allocation financing provision in order to avoid a default on the bonds; or
33 (3) The local governing body has adopted an urban renewal plan or com-
34 petitively disadvantaged border community area ordinance or an amendment to
35 an urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border community area
36 ordinance prior to July 1, 2000, in which is defined the duration of the plan
37 beyond a period of twenty (20) years, in which case the revenue allocation
38 provision shall have a duration as described in such urban renewal plan or
39 competitively disadvantaged border community area ordinance or may be ex-
40 tended as set forth in subsection (2) of this section; and or
41 (4) The local governing body has adopted an urban renewal plan or com-
42 petitively disadvantaged border community area ordinance or an amendment to
43 an urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border community area
44 ordinance after July 1, 2000, and prior to July 1, 2011, in which is defined
45 the duration of the plan beyond a period of twenty (20) years in which case
46 the revenue allocation provision shall have a duration as described in such
47 urban renewal plan or competitively disadvantaged border community area
48 ordinance. The duration of the revenue allocation financing provision set
49 forth in this subsection may be extended if the maturity date of any bonds

12
1 issued to provide funds for a specific project in the revenue allocation
2 area and payable from the revenue allocation financing provision exceeds the
3 duration of the revenue allocation financing provision, provided such bond
4 maturity is not greater than thirty (30) years or may be extended as set forth
5 in subsection (2) of this section.; or
6 (5) There is a plan amendment of an existing revenue allocation area to
7 support growth or development of a manufacturing project where the revenue
8 allocation area includes only parcels that are owned or controlled by the
9 project owner and its affiliates, in which case the revenue allocation area
10 financing provision may be extended for up to twenty (20) years during which
11 the agency will continue to receive revenue allocation proceeds under sec-
12 tion 50-2908, Idaho Code, until termination pursuant to the new termination
13 date as approved in the plan amendment. For the purposes of this subsection
14 "controlled by" means that the project owner or its affiliates have entered
15 into a binding contract leasing a parcel that will extend for the duration of
16 the proposed extension of the revenue allocation area financing provision.
17 (5) (6) During the extension set forth in subsections (1),(2),(3),
18 and (4) of this section, any revenue allocation area revenues exceeding the
19 amount necessary to repay the bonds during the period exceeding the maximum
20 year maturity of the revenue allocation financing provision shall be re-
21 turned to the taxing districts in the revenue allocation area on a pro rata
22 basis.
23 SECTION 5. That Section 50-2906, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
24 amended to read as follows:
25 50-2906. PUBLIC HEARING AND ORDINANCE REQUIRED -- SPECIAL RULES FOR
26 CERTAIN TAXING DISTRICTS. (1) To adopt a new urban renewal plan or create
27 a competitively disadvantaged border community area containing a revenue
28 allocation financing provision, the local governing body of an authorized
29 municipality must enact an ordinance in accordance with chapter 9, title 50,
30 Idaho Code, and section 50-2008, Idaho Code. To modify an existing urban
31 renewal plan, to add or change a revenue allocation, an authorized munici-
32 pality must enact an ordinance in accordance with chapter 9, title 50, Idaho
33 Code, and conduct a public hearing as provided in section 50-2008(c), Idaho
34 Code. No urban renewal project, plan, competitively disadvantaged border
35 community area or modification thereto, or revenue allocation financial
36 provision shall be held ineffective for failure to comply with the require-
37 ments of this section if compliance with the section is substantial and in
38 good faith and administrative authority of both the local governing body
39 and urban renewal agency does not extend beyond the municipal boundary of
40 the authorized municipality. Urban renewal plans and revenue allocation
41 financing provisions may be held ineffective if an urban renewal area or rev-
42 enue allocation area extends outside the municipal boundary of an authorized
43 municipality and a transfer of powers ordinance has not been adopted by the
44 cooperating county.
45 (2) A revenue allocation financing provision adopted in accordance
46 with this chapter shall be effective retroactively to January 1 of the year
47 in which the local governing body of the authorized municipality enacts such
48 ordinance.

13
1 (3)(a) The Prior to taking action on an ordinance to adopt a revenue al-
2 location financing provision, the local governing body of an authorized
3 municipality shall prepare a notice stating: (a) that
4 (i) That an urban renewal plan or modification thereto or a com-
5 petitively disadvantaged border community area has been proposed
6 and is being considered for adoption, and that such plan or modi-
7 fication thereto or proposal to create a competitively disadvan-
8 taged border community area contains a revenue allocation financ-
9 ing provision that will cause property taxes resulting from any
10 increases in equalized assessed valuation in excess of the equal-
11 ized assessed valuation as shown on the base assessment roll to be
12 allocated to the agency for urban renewal and competitively disad-
13 vantaged border community area purposes; and (b) that
14 (ii) That an agreement on the administration of a revenue alloca-
15 tion financing provision extending beyond the municipal boundary
16 of the authorized municipality has been negotiated with the coop-
17 erating county having extraterritorial power and that the agree-
18 ment has been formalized by a transfer of power ordinance adopted
19 by that county; and (c) that
20 (iii) That a public hearing on such plan or modification will be
21 held by the local governing body pursuant to section 50-2008(c),
22 Idaho Code.
23 (b) The notice shall also state the time, date, and place of the hear-
24 ing. At least thirty (30) days but not more than sixty (60) days prior
25 to the date set for final reading of the ordinance, the local governing
26 body shall publish the notice in a newspaper of general circulation and
27 transmit the notice, together with a copy of the plan and recommenda-
28 tion of the urban renewal agency or the municipality which by ordinance
29 created the competitively disadvantaged border community area, to the
30 governing body of each taxing district which levies taxes upon any tax-
31 able property in the revenue allocation area and which would be affected
32 by the revenue allocation financing provision of the urban renewal plan
33 proposed to be approved by the local governing body.
34 (4) No fire protection district or ambulance service district shall be
35 subject to the financing provisions of an urban renewal revenue allocation
36 area, or any modification thereof, created or modified after July 1, 2025,
37 unless the local governing body of the authorized municipality proposing to
38 create or modify such financing provision requests such district to consent
39 to be subject to the financing provision and the district receiving such
40 request consents. To request such a district to consent, the local governing
41 body of an authorized municipality shall send a request to the district at
42 the same time it sends notice to taxing districts of its intent to create or
43 modify an urban renewal plan that includes a revenue allocation financing
44 provision pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. If the governing board
45 of the district receiving a request to consent agrees with the request, it
46 shall adopt a resolution providing that such district shall be subject to
47 the financing provisions of the proposed urban renewal area plan or proposed
48 urban renewal area plan modification that was identified in the request, and
49 shall thereafter be subject to such financing provision. The consenting
50 district shall, within ten (10) business days, file a copy of the resolution

14
1 with the local governing body of the authorized municipality. Upon receipt
2 of the district's resolution consenting to be subject to the financing pro-
3 vision, the governing body of the municipality shall transmit a copy of such
4 resolution to the county clerk and the state tax commission within ten (10)
5 business days.
6 (5)(a) Any fire protection district or ambulance service district may
7 withdraw from being subject to an urban renewal revenue allocation fi-
8 nancing provision under an urban renewal plan established by local gov-
9 erning body ordinance prior to July 1, 2025, if the urban renewal plan
10 establishing the revenue allocation financing provision does not have
11 any outstanding bonds, contractual obligations, or other indebtedness
12 being funded by such revenue allocation financing provision greater
13 than the amount of the revenue allocation proceeds that was attribut-
14 able to the fire protection district or ambulance service district as of
15 December 31 of the immediate prior tax year.
16 (b) Any fire protection district or ambulance service district that
17 seeks to withdraw shall:
18 (i) By May 1 of the withdrawal year request an accounting from
19 the county showing the amount of revenue allocation proceeds that
20 was attributable to the fire protection district or ambulance ser-
21 vice district as of December 31 of the immediate prior tax year. A
22 copy of the accounting shall be simultaneously transmitted by the
23 county to the requesting district and the agency within fifteen
24 (15) days of receipt of the request from the district; and
25 (ii) By June 1 of the withdrawal year adopt a resolution express-
26 ing an intent to withdraw and transmit the same to the urban re-
27 newal agency that governs the urban renewal plan and revenue al-
28 location financing provision that the district seeks to withdraw
29 from.
30 (c) The agency shall schedule a special meeting within ten (10) busi-
31 ness days of receipt of the fire protection district's or ambulance ser-
32 vice district's resolution approving the withdrawal and the accounting
33 from the county to accept the request to withdraw by agency resolution,
34 or to deny the request to withdraw in writing due to the existence of
35 outstanding bonds, contractual obligations, or other indebtedness be-
36 ing funded by the district's revenue allocation proceeds, and setting
37 forth specific information about the indebtedness.
38 (d) If the withdrawal is accepted, the urban renewal agency shall
39 transmit a copy of the district resolution and the agency resolution to
40 the county clerk, the county recorder, and the state tax commission no
41 later than the fourth Monday of July. If the resolutions are received
42 by the state tax commission and the county by the fourth Monday of July,
43 then the levy rate for the next fiscal year will be calculated pursuant
44 to section 50-2908(1)(g), Idaho Code, and any budget increases as set
45 forth in sections 63-802 and 63-301A, Idaho Code. If the resolutions
46 are transmitted to the county clerk, the county recorder, and the state
47 tax commission after the fourth Monday of July, then the effect of the
48 withdrawal will be the following tax year.
49 SECTION 6. That Section 50-2907, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
50 amended to read as follows:

15
1 50-2907. TRANSMITTAL OF REVENUE ALLOCATION AREA DESCRIPTION AND OTHER
2 DOCUMENTS TO TAXING AGENCIES. (1) After the effective date of an ordinance
3 enacted by the local governing body of an authorized municipality, the clerk
4 of the authorized municipality shall transmit, to the county auditor and tax
5 assessor of the county in which the revenue allocation area is located, to
6 the affected taxing districts, and to the state tax commission, a copy of the
7 ordinance enacted, a copy of the legal description of the boundaries of the
8 revenue allocation area, and a map indicating the boundaries of the revenue
9 allocation area.
10 (2) For revenue allocation areas extending beyond the corporate munic-
11 ipal boundary of the authorized municipality, the copy of the ordinance en-
12 acted by the authorized municipality shall include, as an attachment, a copy
13 of the transfer of powers ordinance adopted by the cooperating county under
14 section 50-2906(3)(b)(3)(a)(ii), Idaho Code.
15 (3) Such documents shall be transmitted within the time required by
16 section 63-215, Idaho Code.
17 SECTION 7. That Section 50-2908, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
18 amended to read as follows:
19 50-2908. DETERMINATION OF TAX LEVIES -- CREATION OF SPECIAL FUND. (1)
20 For purposes of calculating the rate at which taxes shall be levied by or
21 for each taxing district in which a revenue allocation area is located, the
22 county commissioners shall, with respect to the taxable property located in
23 such revenue allocation area, use the equalized assessed value of such tax-
24 able property as shown on the base assessment roll rather than on the current
25 equalized assessed valuation of such taxable property, except the current
26 equalized assessed valuation shall be used for calculating the tax rate for:
27 (a) Levies for refunds and credits pursuant to section 63-1305, Idaho
28 Code, and any judgment pursuant to section 33-802(1), Idaho Code, cer-
29 tified after December 31, 2007;
30 (b) Levies permitted pursuant to section 63-802(3), Idaho Code, certi-
31 fied after December 31, 2007;
32 (c) Levies for voter-approved general obligation bonds of any taxing
33 district and plant facility reserve fund levies passed after December
34 31, 2007;

36 firmed pursuant to chapter 13, title 7, Idaho Code, and that meet the
37 criteria of sections 63-1315 and 63-1316, Idaho Code;
38 (e) Levies set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection,
39 first certified prior to December 31, 2007, when the property affected
40 by said levies is included within the boundaries of a revenue allocation
41 area by a change in the boundaries of either the revenue allocation area
42 or any taxing district after December 31, 2007; and
43 (f) School levies for supplemental maintenance and operation pursuant
44 to section 33-802(3) and (4), Idaho Code, approved after December 31,
45 2007, and for emergency funds pursuant to section 33-805, Idaho Code,
46 approved after July 1, 2015.; and
47 (g) Levies of fire protection districts pursuant to chapter 14, title
48 31, Idaho Code, and ambulance services districts pursuant to chapter
49 39, title 31, Idaho Code, that are exempt from being subject to a revenue

16
1 allocation financing provision pursuant to section 50-2906(4), Idaho
2 Code, or that withdraw from being subject to a revenue allocation fi-
3 nancing provision pursuant to section 50-2906(5), Idaho Code.
4 (2) With respect to each such taxing district, the tax rate calculated
5 under subsection (1) of this section shall be applied to the current equal-
6 ized assessed valuation of all taxable property in the taxing district, in-
7 cluding the taxable property in the revenue allocation area. The tax rev-
8 enues thereby produced shall be allocated as follows:
9 (a) To the taxing district shall be allocated and shall be paid by the
10 county treasurer:
11 (i) All taxes levied by the taxing district or on its behalf on
12 taxable property located within the taxing district but outside
13 the revenue allocation area;
14 (ii) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (iv) of this
15 paragraph, a portion of the taxes levied by the taxing district or
16 on its behalf on the taxable property located within the revenue
17 allocation area, which portion is the amount produced by applying
18 the taxing district's tax rate determined under subsection (1) of
19 this section to the equalized assessed valuation, as shown on the
20 base assessment roll, of the taxable property located within the
21 revenue allocation area;
22 (iii) All taxes levied by the taxing district to satisfy obliga-
23 tions specified in subsection (1) of this section; and
24 (iv) In the case of a revenue allocation area first formed or ex-
25 panded to include the property on or after July 1, 2020, all taxes
26 levied by any highway district, unless the local governing body
27 that created the revenue allocation area has responsibility for
28 the maintenance of roads or highways. In the case of property lo-
29 cated within a revenue allocation area prior to July 1, 2020, or
30 property located within a revenue allocation area created by a lo-
31 cal governing body that has responsibility for the maintenance of
32 roads or highways, the allocation of taxes shall be governed by
33 subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. In any case, the highway dis-
34 trict and the urban renewal agency may enter into an agreement for
35 a different allocation. A copy of any such agreement shall be sub-
36 mitted to the state tax commission and to the county clerk by the
37 highway district as soon as practicable after the parties have en-
38 tered into the contract and by no later than September 1 of the year
39 in which the agreement takes effect.
40 (b) To the urban renewal agency shall be allocated the balance, if any,
41 of the taxes levied on the taxable property located within the revenue
42 allocation area.
43 (3) Upon enactment of an ordinance adopting a revenue allocation fi-
44 nancing provision as part of an urban renewal plan, the urban renewal agency
45 shall create a special fund or funds to be used for the purposes enumerated
46 in this chapter. The revenues allocated to the urban renewal agency pursuant
47 to this chapter shall be paid to the agency by the treasurer of the county in
48 which the revenue allocation district is located and shall be deposited by
49 the agency into one (1) or more of such special funds. The agency may, in ad-
50 dition, deposit into such special fund or funds such other income, proceeds,

17
1 revenues and funds it may receive from sources other than the revenues allo-
2 cated to it under subsection (2)(b) of this section.
3 (4) For the purposes of section 63-803, Idaho Code, during the period
4 when revenue allocation under this chapter is in effect, and solely with
5 respect to any taxing district in which a revenue allocation area is located,
6 the county commissioners shall, in fixing any tax levy other than a levy
7 specified in subsection (1) of this section, take into consideration the
8 equalized assessed valuation of the taxable property situated in the revenue
9 allocation area as shown in the base assessment roll, rather than the current
10 equalized assessed value of such taxable property.
11 (5) For all other purposes, including, without limitation, for pur-
12 poses of sections 33-802, 33-1002 and 63-1313, Idaho Code, reference in the
13 Idaho Code to the term "market value for assessment purposes" (or any other
14 such similar term) shall mean market value for assessment purposes as de-
15 fined in section 63-208, Idaho Code.
16 SECTION 8. That Chapter 29, Title 50, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
17 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
18 ignated as Section 50-2914, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:

20 FINANCING PROVISION. (1) An urban renewal agency may terminate an urban
21 renewal plan containing a revenue allocation financing provision on or
22 before the termination date in accordance with the provisions of sections
23 50-2903(5) and 50-2909(4), Idaho Code. The urban renewal agency shall con-
24 sider its ability to receive revenue in the year following the termination
25 date when determining the timing of termination and the termination date.
26 (2) The local governing body of the municipality may initiate termina-
27 tion of an urban renewal plan containing a revenue allocation financing pro-
28 vision before the termination date as follows:
29 (a) The local governing body may adopt a resolution that directs the
30 urban renewal agency to provide a termination plan for the termination
31 of a specified urban renewal plan containing a revenue allocation fi-
32 nancing provision to the local governing body within sixty (60) days of
33 the agency's receipt of the local governing body's resolution, or such
34 longer period as may be agreed to by the local governing body. Upon the
35 adoption of the resolution, the urban renewal agency governing the ur-
36 ban renewal plan identified in the resolution shall no longer have the
37 authority to enter into any financial obligations secured by the fund-
38 ing from any urban renewal financing provision of any urban renewal plan
39 specified in the resolution, other than such obligations as are neces-
40 sary to facilitate the termination of the urban renewal plan.
41 (b) The termination plan submitted by the urban renewal agency shall
42 include a detailed summary of all agency obligations under such urban
43 renewal plan and anticipated future obligations to implement the plan
44 through the duration of the plan, including information on the use of
45 revenues collected to fund specific projects and any capital improve-
46 ment project plans. The termination plan shall also include a proposed
47 termination timeline.
48 (c) The local governing body may then enact an ordinance terminating
49 the urban renewal plan and any revenue allocation financing provisions

18
1 included in such plan. The ordinance shall be recorded in the real prop-
2 erty records of the county in which the agency operated. The local gov-
3 erning body shall transmit a copy of the recorded termination ordinance
4 to the county clerk, any affected taxing districts, and the state tax
5 commission within ten (10) business days of the recording date.
6 SECTION 9. That Section 63-301A, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
7 amended to read as follows:

15 rent year's property roll that is directly the result of new construc-
16 tion;
17 (d) The amount of taxable market value added as provided in subsection
18 (3)(f) of this section as a result of dissolution of any revenue alloca-
19 tion area; and
20 (e) The amount of taxable market value to be deducted to reflect the ad-
21 justments required in this paragraph:
22 (i) Any board of tax appeals or court-ordered value change, if
23 property has a taxable value lower than that shown on any new con-
24 struction roll in any one (1) of the immediate five (5) tax years
25 preceding the current tax year;
26 (ii) Any reduction in value resulting from correction of value im-
27 properly included on any previous new construction roll as a re-
28 sult of double or otherwise erroneous assessment;
29 (iii) Any reduction in value resulting from the exemption provided
30 in section 63-602W(4), Idaho Code, in any one (1) of the immediate

40 in subsection (3)(e) of this section shall be reported to the appropriate
41 county auditor by the state tax commission by the third Monday in July and the
42 value sent by the county auditor to each taxing district. The value estab-

44 tion by the state tax commission until the first Monday in September, and any
45 such corrections shall be sent to the appropriate county auditor, who shall
46 notify any affected taxing districts.

48 the new construction roll shall include ninety percent (90%) of the taxable
49 market value increase from:

12 tion 63-405, Idaho Code, or that is owned by a cooperative or municipal-
13 ity as those terms are defined in section 61-332A, Idaho Code, or that
14 is owned by a public utility as that term is defined in section 61-332A,
15 Idaho Code, owning any other property that is allocated or apportioned.
16 No replacement equipment or improvements may be included;
17 (f) Provided such increases do not include increases already reported
18 on the new construction roll as permitted in paragraphs (i) and (j) of
19 this subsection, increases in value over the base value of property on
20 the base assessment roll within an urban renewal revenue allocation
21 area that has been terminated pursuant to section 50-2909(4) 50-2914,
22 Idaho Code, to the extent that this increment exceeds the incremental
23 value as of December 31, 2006, or, for revenue allocation areas formed
24 after December 31, 2006, eighty percent (80%) of the increment value.
25 Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, the new construction
26 roll shall not include new construction located within an urban renewal
27 district's revenue allocation area, except as provided in this para-
28 graph or paragraph (k) of this subsection;
29 (g) New construction, in any one (1) of the immediate five (5) tax years

34 which the property should have been included;
35 (h) Formerly exempt improvements on state college-owned or state uni-
36 versity-owned land for student dining, housing, or other education-re-
37 lated purposes approved by the state board of education and board of

39 state college or university, provided such improvements were never in-
40 cluded on any previous new construction roll;
41 (i) Increases in base value when due to previously determined incre-
42 ment value added to the base value as required in sections 50-2903 and
43 50-2903A, Idaho Code, due to a modification of the urban renewal plan.
44 In this case, the amount added to the new construction roll will equal
45 eighty percent (80%) of the amount by which the increment value in the
46 year immediately preceding the year in which the base value adjustment
47 described in this subsection occurs exceeds the incremental value as of
48 December 31, 2006, or, for revenue allocation areas formed after Decem-
49 ber 31, 2006, the entire increment value; and

7 scribed in this subsection occurs exceeds the incremental value as of
8 December 31, 2006, or, for revenue allocation areas formed after Decem-
9 ber 31, 2006, the entire increment value within the area subject to the
10 de-annexation.

12 district that encompasses all or part of any urban renewal revenue
13 allocation area that such district withdrew from pursuant to section
14 50-2906(5), Idaho Code, eighty percent (80%) of the increment value may
15 be included on the new construction roll for the year in which the dis-
16 trict withdrew from such urban renewal revenue allocation area. Each
17 year thereafter, ninety percent (90%) of the taxable value of otherwise
18 qualifying new construction shall be included in the new construction
19 roll for such fire protection district or ambulance service district,
20 even if such new construction would not otherwise qualify because it was
21 located within a revenue allocation area.
22 (4) The amount of taxable market value of new construction shall be the
23 change in net taxable market value that is attributable directly to the new
24 construction or loss of the exemption provided by section 63-602W(3) or (4),
25 Idaho Code. It shall not include any change in value of existing property
26 that is due to external market forces such as general or localized inflation,
27 except as provided in subsection (3)(f) of this section.
28 (5) The amount of taxable market value of new construction shall not in-
29 clude any new construction of property that has been granted a provisional
30 property tax exemption, pursuant to section 63-1305C, Idaho Code. A prop-
31 erty owner may apply to the board of county commissioners, if an application
32 is required pursuant to section 63-602, Idaho Code, for an exemption from
33 property tax at the time the initial building permits are applied for or at
34 the time construction of the property has begun, whichever is earlier, or at
35 any time thereafter.
36 (6) The amount of taxable market value of new construction shall not in-
37 clude any new construction of property for which an exemption from sales and
38 use tax has been granted pursuant to section 63-3622VV, Idaho Code.

16 taxing districts and budgeted against at the same time, and in the same
17 manner, and in the same year as revenues from taxation. The total amount
18 paid to the county treasurers shall not exceed the amount certified to
19 the state tax commission under subsection (3) of this section.
20 (c) For purposes of the limitation provided by section 63-802, Idaho
21 Code, moneys received from distributions pursuant to section 63-3638,

26 forest lands or forest products pursuant to chapter 17, title 63, Idaho
27 Code, or the taxation of the net profits of mines pursuant to chapter 28,

39 each item of personal property if more than the exemption allowed in
40 subsection (1) of this section, and the total cost of the items of per-
41 sonal property.
42 (b) The application for this exemption, if the county is capable of so
43 providing, may be transmitted by the county assessor electronically,
44 as that term is defined in section 63-115, Idaho Code, when requested
45 by the taxpayer, or mailed by the county assessor to the taxpayer, or
46 his agent or representative at the taxpayer's last known post office
47 address, no later than March 1 of each year. The transmission or mail-
48 ing of the application shall also include the taxpayer's application
49 for the exemption allowed by this section for the last year in which the
50 taxpayer filed an application.

25
1 (c) A taxpayer need only make application for the exemption in this sec-
2 tion once as long as all of the following conditions are met:
3 (i) The taxpayer has received the exemption during the previous
4 year as a result of him making a valid application as defined in
5 this section.
6 (ii) The amount of the exemption allowed by this section is more
7 than the taxable value of personal property owned by the taxpayer.
8 (iii) The taxpayer has not made purchases of personal property,
9 excluding items of taxable personal property exempted pursuant to
10 subsection (1) of this section, that would cause the taxable value
11 of the personal property owned by the taxpayer to exceed the maxi-
12 mum amount allowed as an exemption by this section.
13 (d) Knowingly failing to report changes in the taxable value of per-
14 sonal property that exceed the amount of the exemption allowed pursuant
15 to this section shall subject the taxpayer to a fine not in excess of ten
16 thousand dollars ($10,000) in addition to other penalties set forth in
17 this chapter.
18 (7) Recovery of property tax exemptions allowed by this section but im-
19 properly claimed:
20 (a) Upon discovery of evidence, facts or circumstances indicating any
21 exemption allowed by this section was improperly claimed, the county
22 assessor shall decide whether the exemption claimed should have been
23 allowed and, if not, notify the board of county commissioners, at which
24 time the board may waive a recovery of the property tax and notify such
25 taxpayer in writing.
26 (b) The assessment and collection of the recovery of property tax must
27 begin within the seven (7) year period beginning on the date the assess-
28 ment notice reflecting the improperly claimed exemption was required to
29 be mailed to the taxpayer.
30 (c) The taxpayer may appeal to the board of tax appeals the decision by
31 the board of county commissioners to assess the recovery of property tax
32 within thirty (30) days of the date the county assessor sent the notice
33 to the taxpayer pursuant to this section.
34 (d) For purposes of calculating the tax, the amount of the recovered
35 property tax shall be for each year the exemption allowed by this sec-
36 tion was improperly claimed or approved, up to a maximum of seven (7)
37 years. The amount of the recovery of property tax shall be calculated
38 using the product of the amount of exempted value for each year multi-
39 plied by the levy for that year plus costs, late charges and interest for
40 each year at the rates equal to those provided for delinquent property
41 taxes during that year. In cases of fraud, the fine set forth in subsec-
42 tion (6)(d) of this section shall be assessed for each tax year.
43 (e) Any recovery of property tax shall be due and payable no later than
44 the date provided for property taxes in section 63-903, Idaho Code, and
45 if not timely paid, late charges and interest, beginning the first day
46 of January in the year following the year the county assessor sent the
47 notice to the taxpayer pursuant to this section, shall be calculated at
48 the current rate provided for property taxes.
49 (f) Recovered property taxes shall be billed, collected and dis-
50 tributed in the same manner as property taxes. If the recovery is

26
1 for property tax for which the state provided replacement money, the
2 amounts recovered shall be reported and remitted to the state tax
3 commission, which shall reimburse the general fund. The state tax com-
4 mission will then notify each affected taxing district or unit of its
5 proportionate share of the recovered property tax, which amount shall
6 be deducted from future payments to be made pursuant to subsection (3)
7 of this section.
8 (g) Thirty (30) days after the taxpayer is notified, as provided in
9 paragraph (a) of this subsection, the assessor shall record a notice
10 of intent to attach a lien. Upon the payment in full of such recov-
11 ered property taxes prior to the attachment of the lien as provided in
12 paragraph (h) of this subsection, or upon the successful appeal by the
13 taxpayer, the county assessor shall record a rescission of the intent to
14 attach a lien within seven (7) business days of receiving such payment
15 or within seven (7) business days of the county commissioners' decision
16 granting the appeal.
17 (h) Any unpaid recovered property taxes shall become a lien upon the
18 taxpayer's personal property in the same manner as provided for prop-
19 erty taxes in section 63-206, Idaho Code, except such lien shall attach
20 as of the first day of January in the year following the year the county
21 treasurer sent the notice to the taxpayer pursuant to this section.
22 (i) For purposes of the limitation provided by section 63-802, Idaho
23 Code, moneys received pursuant to this subsection as recovery of prop-
24 erty tax shall be treated as property tax revenue.
25 (8) For operating property with values apportioned to more than one (1)
26 county, the personal property exemption shall be subtracted from the Idaho
27 allocated value prior to apportionment and, for private railcar companies,
28 prior to determining whether their values are to be apportioned. Notwith-
29 standing amounts calculated as provided in subsection (1) of this section,
30 the amount of the exemption otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this sec-
31 tion shall be calculated as follows:
32 (a) Take the lesser amount of:
33 (i) The number of counties in which a company has operating prop-
34 erty multiplied by two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000);
35 or
36 (ii) The total statewide value of eligible personal property re-
37 ported by the company.
38 (b) Reduce the amount calculated in paragraph (a) of this subsection by
39 the value of any nonoperating personal property granted the exemption
40 otherwise found in subsection (2) of this section, as reported by county
41 assessors.
42 SECTION 13. That Section 63-802, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
43 amended to read as follows:
44 63-802. LIMITATION ON BUDGET REQUESTS -- LIMITATION ON TAX CHARGES --
45 EXCEPTIONS. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no taxing dis-
46 trict shall certify a budget request for an amount of property tax revenues
47 to finance an annual budget that exceeds the maximum sum permitted under this
48 section:

27
1 (a)(i) The highest dollar amount of property taxes certified for
2 its annual budget for any one (1) of the three (3) tax years preced-
3 ing the current tax year, which amount may be increased by a growth
4 factor of not to exceed three percent (3%) plus the amount of rev-
5 enue calculated as described in this subsection. The taxing dis-
6 trict shall determine what portion of the three percent (3%) in-
7 crease permitted under this subparagraph that it requires and then
8 calculate a preliminary levy rate based on the percent chosen. In
9 calculating the preliminary levy rate, the most current taxable
10 market value shall be used, except that for taxable market values
11 of centrally assessed operating property, the prior year's valua-
12 tion may be used instead of the current year's taxable market val-
13 ues. The preliminary levy rate shall be multiplied by the value
14 shown on the new construction roll compiled pursuant to section
15 63-301A, Idaho Code, and by ninety percent (90%) of the value of
16 annexation during the previous calendar year, as certified by the
17 state tax commission for taxable market values of operating prop-
18 erty of public utilities and by the county assessor; except for a
19 fire protection district annexing property prior to July 1, 2021,
20 pursuant to section 31-1429, Idaho Code, the new levy rate shall be
21 multiplied by one hundred percent (100%) of the value of any such
22 property annexed prior to July 1, 2021.
23 (ii) The total budget increase calculated under this paragraph
24 must not exceed eight percent (8%), except that any increase in the
25 amount of property tax revenue to finance an annual budget added
26 as a result of the termination, deannexation, or plan modification
27 of, or the withdrawal of certain taxing districts from, a revenue
28 allocation area of an urban renewal district pursuant to section
29 63-301A(3)(g), (j), or (k),(3)(f), (i), (j), or (k), Idaho Code,
30 or section 50-2908(1)(g), Idaho Code, shall not be subject to such
31 limitation.
32 (iii) Following the first year in which a fire protection district
33 has annexed city property pursuant to section 31-1429, Idaho Code,
34 the city shall subtract an amount equal to the moneys spent on fire
35 protection services during the last full year the city provided
36 fire protection services to its residents from its budget limita-
37 tion under this section.
38 (b) If the taxing district has not imposed a levy for three (3) or more
39 years, the highest dollar amount of property taxes certified for its an-
40 nual budget for the purpose of paragraph (a)(i) of this subsection shall
41 be the dollar amount of property taxes certified for its annual budget
42 during the last year in which a levy was made.
43 (c) The dollar amount of the actual budget request may be substituted
44 for the amount in paragraph (a) of this subsection if the taxing dis-
45 trict is newly created, except as may be provided in paragraph (i) of
46 this subsection.
47 (d) This section does not apply to school district levies imposed in
48 section 33-802, Idaho Code.
49 (e)(i) In the case of a nonschool district for which less than the
50 maximum allowable increase in the dollar amount of property taxes

28
1 is certified for annual budget purposes in any one (1) year, such a
2 district may, in any following year, recover the forgone increase
3 by certifying, in addition to any increase otherwise allowed, any
4 or all of the increase originally forgone. Provided however, that
5 prior to budgeting any forgone increase, the district must provide
6 notice of its intent to do so, hold a public hearing that may be in
7 conjunction with its annual budget hearing, and certify by resolu-
8 tion the amount of forgone increase to be budgeted and the specific
9 purpose for which the forgone increase is being budgeted. Upon
10 adoption of the resolution, the clerk of the district shall file a
11 copy of the resolution with the county clerk and the state tax com-
12 mission. Said additional amount shall be included in future cal-
13 culations for increases as allowed, except as provided in subpara-
14 graph (iii) of this paragraph.
15 (ii) If the forgone increase is budgeted for the purpose of main-
16 tenance and operations, the rate of recovering the reserved for-
17 gone moneys may increase the taxing district's budget by no more
18 than one percent (1%) per year.
19 (iii) If the forgone increase is budgeted for a capital project or
20 projects, the rate of recovering the reserved forgone moneys may
21 not exceed three percent (3%) of the taxing district's budget for
22 the year in which the forgone increase is budgeted. Forgone moneys
23 budgeted for a capital project must be deducted from the taxing
24 district's forgone balance in the year in which it is budgeted.
25 Upon completion of such a capital project, the taxing district
26 shall certify such completion to the state tax commission and
27 county clerk. If, upon certification, the state tax commission
28 finds that the taxing district included forgone moneys for a capi-
29 tal project in calculating the increase permitted under paragraph
30 (a) of this subsection, the state tax commission shall direct the
31 taxing district to reduce its property tax budget for any year
32 in which the forgone moneys were used to calculate a budget in-
33 crease, in an amount equal to the forgone moneys budgeted plus any
34 increases attributed to the forgone moneys improperly included in
35 the taxing district's property tax budget. For the purpose of this
36 paragraph, a capital project includes:
37 1. The construction, expansion, renovation, or replacement
38 of public facilities, including the acquisition of land and
39 other site improvements;
40 2. The construction, expansion, or reconstruction of public
41 works improvements, including roads, bridges, water sys-
42 tems, sewer systems, and broadband systems; and
43 3. The purchase of equipment with a useful life of ten (10)
44 years or more.
45 (f) If a taxing district elects to budget less than the maximum allow-
46 able increase in the dollar amount of property taxes, the taxing dis-
47 trict may reserve the right to recover all or any portion of that year's
48 forgone increase in a subsequent year by adoption of a resolution spec-
49 ifying the dollar amount of property taxes being reserved. Otherwise,
50 that year's forgone increase may not be recovered under paragraph (e) of

29
1 this subsection. The district must provide notice of its intent to do so
2 and hold a public hearing that may be in conjunction with its annual bud-
3 get hearing, if applicable. The resolution to reserve the right to re-
4 cover the forgone increase for that year shall be adopted at the annual
5 budget hearing of the taxing district if the district has a budget hear-
6 ing requirement.
7 (g) In the case of cities, if the immediately preceding year's levy sub-
8 ject to the limitation provided by this section is less than 0.004, the
9 city may increase its budget by an amount not to exceed the difference
10 between 0.004 and the actual prior year's levy multiplied by the prior
11 year's market value for assessment purposes. The additional amount
12 must be approved by sixty percent (60%) of the voters voting on the ques-
13 tion at an election called for that purpose and held on the date in May or
14 November provided by law and may be included in the annual budget of the
15 city for purposes of this section.
16 (h) A taxing district may submit to the electors within the district
17 the question of whether the budget from property tax revenues may be
18 increased beyond the amount authorized in this section, but not beyond
19 the levy authorized by statute. The additional amount must be approved
20 by sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) or more of the voters
21 voting on the question at an election called for that purpose and held
22 on the May or November dates provided by section 34-106, Idaho Code.
23 If approved by the required minimum sixty-six and two-thirds percent
24 (66 2/3%) of the voters voting at the election, the new budget amount
25 shall be the base budget for the purposes of this section.
26 (i) When a nonschool district consolidates with another nonschool
27 district or dissolves and a new district performing similar governmen-
28 tal functions as the dissolved district forms with the same boundaries
29 within three (3) years, the maximum amount of a budget of the district
30 from property tax revenues shall not be greater than the sum of the
31 amounts that would have been authorized by this section for the district
32 itself or for the districts that were consolidated or dissolved and in-
33 corporated into a new district.
34 (j) This section does not apply to cooperative service agency levies
35 imposed in sections 33-317 and 33-317A, Idaho Code.
36 (k) The amount of money received in the twelve (12) months immediately
37 preceding June 30 of the current tax year as a result of distributions of
38 the tax provided in section 63-3502B(2), Idaho Code.
39 (2) In the case of fire districts, during the year immediately follow-
40 ing the election of a public utility or public utilities to consent to be pro-
41 vided fire protection pursuant to section 31-1425, Idaho Code, the maximum
42 amount of property tax revenues permitted in subsection (1) of this section
43 may be increased by an amount equal to the current year's taxable value of the
44 consenting public utility or public utilities multiplied by that portion of
45 the prior year's levy subject to the limitation provided by subsection (1) of
46 this section.
47 (3) No board of county commissioners shall set a levy, nor shall the
48 state tax commission approve a levy for annual budget purposes, which ex-
49 ceeds the limitation imposed in subsection (1) of this section unless au-
50 thority to exceed such limitation has been approved by a majority of the tax-

30
1 ing district's electors voting on the question at an election called for that
2 purpose and held pursuant to section 34-106, Idaho Code, provided however,
3 that such voter approval shall be for a period of not to exceed two (2) years.
4 (4) The amount of property tax revenues to finance an annual budget does
5 not include revenues from nonproperty tax sources and does not include rev-
6 enue from levies for the payment of judicially confirmed obligations pur-
7 suant to sections 63-1315 and 63-1316, Idaho Code, and revenue from levies
8 that are voter-approved for bonds, override levies or supplemental levies,
9 plant facilities reserve fund levies, school emergency fund levies, or for
10 levies applicable to newly annexed property or for levies applicable to new
11 construction as evidenced by the value of property subject to the occupancy
12 tax pursuant to section 63-317, Idaho Code, for the preceding tax year. The
13 amount of property tax revenues to finance an annual budget does not include
14 any property taxes that were collected and refunded on property that is ex-
15 empt from taxation, pursuant to section 63-1305C, Idaho Code.
16 (5) The amount of property tax revenues to finance an annual budget
17 shall include moneys received as recovery of property tax for a revoked pro-
18 visional property tax exemption under section 63-1305C, Idaho Code.
19 (6) For tax year 2023, before calculating the amount required in sub-
20 section (1)(a)(i) of this section, the board of county commissioners shall
21 reduce the approved property tax levy portion of its budget for the immedi-
22 ate prior three (3) years in an amount equal to the amount levied for indigent
23 public defense. The reduced budget amount shall be the base budget for the
24 purpose of subsection (1)(a)(i) of this section.
25 SECTION 14. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
26 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after its
27 passage and approval, and retroactively to January 1, 2025.
