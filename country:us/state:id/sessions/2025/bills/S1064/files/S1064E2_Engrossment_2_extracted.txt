3 PROVISIONS REGARDING CLOUD SEEDING; AMENDING CHAPTER 43, TITLE 42,
4 IDAHO CODE, BY THE ADDITION OF A NEW SECTION 42-4302, IDAHO CODE, TO DE-
5 FINE TERMS; AMENDING CHAPTER 43, TITLE 42, IDAHO CODE, BY THE ADDITION

12 SECTION 1. That Section 42-4301, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
13 amended to read as follows:
14 42-4301. CLOUD SEEDING -- LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. (1) The legislature
15 finds that:
16 (a) Idaho's economy and the welfare of its citizens depend upon a reli-
17 able and sustainable water supply. It is essential, therefore, that the
18 state continues to identify, develop, and implement projects that aug-
19 ment and sustain the state's water resources.
20 (b) The cloud seeding program developed and implemented by the Idaho
21 water resource board, in cooperation with interested stakeholders,
22 presents a unique and innovative opportunity to augment and sustain the
23 water resources of the state.
24 (c) Augmenting water supplies through cloud seeding is may be in the
25 public interest. Public benefits of cloud seeding include drought mit-
26 igation, protection of water rights, protection of municipal and busi-
27 ness activities dependent on water, water quality, recreation, and fish
28 and wildlife.
29 (d) Data accumulated and analysis undertaken since the initiation of
30 the cloud seeding program demonstrates that cloud seeding has resulted
31 may result in an annual increase in the water supplies in the basins in
32 which cloud seeding has been performed. However, additional research
33 and analysis is necessary to determine the precise nature and extent of
34 those increases. The legislature recommends that such research be con-
35 tinued as the cloud seeding program progresses and that annual reports
36 on such research be provided to the legislature.
37 (e) (2) The legislature recognizes that expansion of the cloud seeding
38 program may benefit basins throughout the state that experience depleted or
39 insufficient water supplies, and the legislature recommends that the wa-
40 ter resource board complete an assessment of basins and work with affected
41 stakeholders to implement the cloud seeding program in basins that would
42 benefit from the program.
2
1 (2) As used in this chapter, "cloud seeding" means all acts undertaken
2 to artificially distribute or create nuclei in cloud masses for the purposes
3 of inducing precipitation, cloud forms, or other meteorological parameters.
4 Cloud seeding for the suppression of fog and frost prevention measures for
5 the protection of orchards and crops are excluded from the coverage of this
6 chapter.
7 (3) The water resource board shall authorize, and may sponsor or de-
8 velop, local or statewide cloud seeding programs and may contract any indi-
9 vidual or organization for consultation and assistance in developing cloud
10 seeding programs or in furthering research related to cloud seeding.
11 (4) State funds may be used or expended on cloud seeding programs only
12 in basins where the water resource board finds that existing water supplies
13 are not sufficient to support existing water rights, water quality, recre-
14 ation, or fish and wildlife uses dependent on those water supplies. Water
15 generated through cloud seeding shall be distributed in accordance with the
16 prior appropriation doctrine.
17 (5) The act of cloud seeding pursuant to a project funded in whole or
18 in part by the state of Idaho or authorized by the state water resource board
19 shall not be the basis of any claim of liability, including but not limited
20 to trespass or public or private nuisance, and shall not require any state or
