15 moved, the license shall be suspended until the same shall be removed. The

21 rule and shall be subject to annual renewal upon proper application. The
22 director will determine the renewal month by county based on the number of
23 current licenses within each county, distributing renewals throughout the
24 licensing year. The director may adjust the renewal month to accommodate
25 population increases. Each licensee will be issued a temporary license to
26 operate until the renewal month has been determined. Thereafter, renewals
27 will occur annually on their renewal month. Renewal applications for li-
28 censes accompanied by the required fee must be filed with the director on or

31 license on or before the first day of the designated renewal month shall
32 have a grace period of an additional thirty-one (31) days in which to file an
33 application for renewal of the license. The licensee shall not be permitted
34 to sell beer at retail during the thirty-one (31) day extended time period
35 unless and until the license is renewed.
