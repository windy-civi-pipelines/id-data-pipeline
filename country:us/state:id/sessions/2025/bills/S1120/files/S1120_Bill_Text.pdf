27 son with the neurocognitive disorder is likely to injure an imminent danger
28 to themselves or others must be presented to a duly authorized court within
29 twenty-four (24) hours from the time the person was placed in custody or de-

2 health care provider in such hospital conducting the examination determines
3 the person no longer meets criteria for protective custody, the person shall
4 be deemed to be a voluntary patient and subject to release.
5 (5) If the health care provider in such hospital finds, in an examina-
6 tion pursuant to this section, that the person is likely to have a neurocog-
7 nitive disorder and is likely to injure themselves or others, the prosecut-
8 ing attorney shall file, within twenty-four (24) hours of the examination
