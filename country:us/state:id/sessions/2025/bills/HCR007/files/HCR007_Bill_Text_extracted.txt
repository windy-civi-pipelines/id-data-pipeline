LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 7
BY BUSINESS COMMITTEE
1 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
2 STATING FINDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND REAFFIRMING SUPPORT FOR THE STATE-
3 BASED SYSTEM OF TITLE INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES IN RE-
4 SPONSE TO GROWING FEDERAL ENCROACHMENT.
5 Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
6 WHEREAS, the state-based system of insurance regulation in the United
7 States has effectively protected consumers and helped create the largest,
8 most competitive, and innovative insurance market in the world; and
9 WHEREAS, Congress has continually affirmed the primacy of state-based
10 insurance regulation, including in the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945 and
11 most recently in the Dodd-Frank act of 2010; and
12 WHEREAS, preventing federal overreach into state insurance markets is
13 imperative to ensure that insurance is accessible and accountable to the
14 public and sensitive to local social and economic conditions in order to
15 adequately meet the varying needs of the different states; and
16 WHEREAS, title insurance is subject to a comprehensive state regulatory
17 structure, enforced by state insurance commissioners and directors, result-
18 ing in lowered risk for lenders and consumers alike; and
19 WHEREAS, despite this success and affirmation, there has been a grow-
20 ing trend in recent years at the federal agency level of encroaching on the
21 long-standing framework of the state-based title insurance regulatory sys-
22 tem; and
23 WHEREAS, this encroachment is extremely troubling and poses a threat to
24 the state-based system of title insurance regulation, and with it the sta-
25 bility and success the state regulatory system has produced; and
26 WHEREAS, this threat is illustrated by recent actions, including:
27 (1) The Federal Housing Finance Agency's announcement of a title accep-
28 tance pilot program that would permit title insurance obtainment require-
29 ments to be waived in certain transactions;
30 (2) Updates to government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) Selling Guides,
31 used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to allow the use of attorney opinion let-
32 ters in lieu of title insurance for certain loans;
33 (3) Certain activities within the Department of the Treasury's Federal
34 Insurance Office, such as convening a roundtable of relevant industry stake-
35 holders, including consumer advocates and academics, in order to discuss the
36 title insurance industry and analyze potential reforms; and
37 (4) The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's request for information
38 regarding fees imposed on residential mortgage transactions, including fees
39 charged by providers of title insurance.
40 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
41 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and
42 the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature reaffirms its unquali-
2
1 fied support for the state-based title insurance regulatory structure in the
2 United States.
3 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature will continue to monitor and
4 push back on any and all attempts by the federal government to infringe upon
5 the state-based system of title insurance regulation and oversight.
6 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature will continue to monitor and
7 push back on any and all attempts by federal agencies or the GSEs to encourage
8 or promote alternatives to title insurance, such as insured attorney opinion
9 letters, accompanied by transactional, surplus lines, or errors and omis-
10 sions insurance wrappers, that seek to provide coverage for title risk in vi-
11 olation of state insurance laws and monoline restrictions, which letters are
12 applicable to the business and regulation of insuring title risk.
13 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature will continue to monitor and
14 push back on any and all attempts to waive title insurance in any mortgage
15 transaction where federal agencies or GSEs act as insurers or are self-in-
16 surers of title risk where they are not state-chartered title insurance com-
17 panies or required to hold reserves for the resulting exposure as state-reg-
18 ulated title insurance companies must do.
