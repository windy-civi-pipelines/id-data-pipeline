23 thousand dollars ($50,000), excluding professional services contracts
24 previously awarded for an associated or phased project, and for which the
25 expenditure is otherwise exempt from the bidding process provided by law. To
26 implement this policy, the public agency and political subdivisions shall:

27 agreement with any of the selected persons or firms, recommence
28 negotiations as described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this sub-
29 section subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph until a
30 contract or agreement is reached or cancel the procurement;

34 the professional service fee is anticipated to exceed the total sum of fifty
35 thousand dollars ($50,000), it shall publish public notice in the same man-
36 ner as required for procurement of public works construction projects under
37 section 67-2805(2), Idaho Code;

48 celed by the public agency or political subdivision prior to the list's expi-

4 than the total sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), the public agency or
5 political subdivision may use the guidelines set forth in subsections (2)
6 through (5) of this section or establish its own guidelines for selection
7 based on demonstrated competence and qualifications to perform the type of
8 services required, followed by negotiation of the fee at a price determined
9 by the public agency or political subdivision to be fair and reasonable after
10 considering the estimated value, scope, complexity, schedule, and nature of
11 services required.

13 previously awarded a professional services contract to a person or firm for
14 an associated or phased project, the public agency or political subdivision
