23 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
24 SECTION 1. That Section 45-617, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
25 amended to read as follows:
26 45-617. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS FOR WAGE CLAIMS. (1) Wage claims
27 filed with the department, excluding potential penalties, are limited by the
28 same dollar amount that limits actions before the small claims department of
29 the magistrate division of the district court.
30 (2) The contested case provisions of the Idaho administrative proce-
31 dure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, are inapplicable to proceedings
32 involving wage claims under this chapter.
33 (3) Once a wage claim has been properly filed with the department, the
34 provisions of this section shall provide the exclusive remedy for resolving
35 the wage claim. If at any time after the filing of the wage claim the depart-
36 ment determines that it lacks jurisdiction over the wage claim, the depart-
37 ment shall provide written notification of its determination to the claimant
38 and the employer. The claimant may then assert the wage claim in any court
39 of competent jurisdiction. In the event the department determines that it
40 lacks jurisdiction over the wage claim, the limitation periods provided for
41 in section 45-614, Idaho Code, shall be tolled from the date the wage claim
42 was filed with the department until the date notice that the department lacks
43 jurisdiction is mailed to the claimant, as provided in subsection (5) (8) of
44 this section.
45 (4) A department compliance officer shall examine wage claims filed
46 with the department and, on the basis of the facts found, shall determine
47 whether the wage claimant is entitled to an award for unpaid wages and penal-
48 ties. If the compliance officer is unable to determine whether wages and
3
1 penalties are owed, the claim may be referred to a hearing officer for a
2 determination. The department may adjust the amount of penalties awarded
3 for an employer's failure to comply with the requirements of section 45-606,
4 Idaho Code. The department may award no penalty or may award a penalty in any
5 amount up to the maximum amount allowed under section 45-607, Idaho Code. No
6 penalty shall be awarded by the department unless a specific finding is made
7 that wages were withheld willfully, arbitrarily and without just cause. The
8 department's determination shall include findings of fact and conclusions
9 of law. Before the determination becomes final or an appeal is filed, the
10 compliance or hearing officer that issued the determination may, on his own
11 motion, issue a revised determination. The determination or revised deter-
12 mination shall become a final determination unless, within fourteen (14)
13 days after notice, as provided in subsection (5) of this section, an appeal
14 is filed by the claimant or the employer in accordance with the department's
15 rules. If an appeal is not timely filed, the amount awarded by a final deter-
16 mination shall become immediately due and payable to the department. A final
17 determination may be enforced by the department in accordance with section
18 45-618, Idaho Code.
19 (5) The claimant and the employer shall be entitled to prompt service
20 of notice of determinations and decisions. Notice shall be deemed served if
21 delivered to the person being served, if mailed to the person's last known
22 address, or if electronically transmitted to the claimant at the claimant's
23 request and with the department's approval. Service by electronic transmis-
24 sion shall be deemed complete on the date notice is electronically transmit-
25 ted. The date indicated on determinations or decisions as the "date of ser-
26 vice" or "date of mailing" shall be presumed to be the date of service unless
27 otherwise shown by a preponderance of competent evidence.
28 (5) The department may dismiss wage claims without prejudice when a
29 claimant fails to respond within thirty (30) days to written notice from
30 the department that additional action is required on the claimant's part to
31 prosecute the claim. The thirty (30) day period for a response begins the
32 date the notice is mailed to the wage claimant's last known address. Mailed
33 responses from claimants are deemed received the date they are postmarked.
34 A wage claim dismissed for lack of prosecution may be refiled with the de-
35 partment subject to the limitation periods provided in section 45-614, Idaho
36 Code.
37 (6) The determinations and revised determinations shall include find-
38 ings of fact and conclusions of law and contain provisions advising the
39 claimant and employer of their rights to appeal the determination within
40 fourteen (14) days from the date of mailing or the date of electronic trans-
41 mission in a manner approved by the department.
42 (7) The timely filing of an appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional. The
43 determination or revised determination shall become a final determination
44 unless an appeal is filed by the claimant or the employer in accordance with
45 this chapter and the department's rules within fourteen (14) days after no-
46 tice provided pursuant to subsection (8) of this section. Provided, how-
47 ever, if a party establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that, because
48 of delay or error by the United States postal service or because of error on
49 the part of the department, a determination or revised determination was not
50 delivered to the party's last known address or transmitted electronically in
4
1 a manner approved by the department within fourteen (14) days of the date of
2 mailing or service indicated on the determination or revised determination,
3 the period for filing a timely appeal to the department or the commission ex-
4 tends to fourteen (14) days from the date of receipt of notice. If an appeal
5 is not timely filed, the amount awarded by a determination or revised deter-
6 mination shall become immediately due and payable to the department and may
7 be enforced by the department in accordance with section 45-618, Idaho Code.
8 (8) The claimant and the employer shall be entitled to prompt service
9 of notice of determinations and revised determinations. Notice shall be
10 deemed served if delivered to the person being served, if mailed to the per-
11 son's last known address, or if electronically transmitted to the claimant
12 at the claimant's request and with the department's approval. Service by
13 electronic transmission shall be deemed complete on the date notice is elec-
14 tronically transmitted. The date indicated on determinations or revised
15 determinations as the date of service or date of mailing shall be presumed to
16 be the date of service unless otherwise shown by a preponderance of competent
17 evidence.
18 (6) (9) An appeal from a wage claim determination or revised determina-
19 tion shall be in writing, signed by the appellant or the appellant's repre-
20 sentative and shall contain words that, by fair interpretation, request the
21 appeal process for a specific determination of the department. The appeal
22 may be filed by personal delivery, by mail, by electronic transmission, or by
23 fax to the wage and hour section of the department at the address indicated on
24 the wage claim determination. The date of personal delivery shall be noted
25 on the appeal and shall be deemed the date of filing. If mailed, the appeal
26 shall be deemed to be filed on the date of mailing as determined by the post-
27 mark. A faxed or electronically transmitted appeal shall be deemed filed on
28 the date received by the wage and hour section. A faxed or electronically
29 transmitted appeal received by the wage and hour section on a weekend or hol-
30 iday shall be deemed filed on the next business day.
31 (7) (10) To hear and decide appeals from determinations, the director
32 shall appoint appeals examiners who have been specifically trained to hear
33 wage claims. Unless the appeal is withdrawn, the appeals examiner shall af-
34 firm, modify, set aside or reverse the determination involved, after afford-
35 ing the claimant and the employer reasonable opportunity for a fair hear-
36 ing, or may refer a matter back to the compliance or hearing officer for fur-
37 ther action. The appeals examiner shall notify the claimant and the employer
38 of his decision by serving notice in the same manner as provided in subsec-
39 tion (5) (8) of this section. The decision shall set forth findings of fact
40 and conclusions of law. The appeals examiner may, upon application for re-
41 hearing by the claimant, the employer, or on his own motion, rehear, affirm,
42 modify, set aside or reverse any prior decision on the basis of the evidence
43 previously submitted or on the basis of additional evidence; provided, that
44 such application or motion be made within ten (10) days after the date of
45 service of the decision. A complete record shall be kept of all proceed-
46 ings in connection with an appealed wage claim. All testimony at any hear-
47 ing shall be recorded. Witnesses subpoenaed by the appeals examiner shall be
48 allowed fees at a rate prescribed by the director. If the claimant or the em-
49 ployer formally requests the appeals examiner to issue a subpoena for a wit-
50 ness whose evidence is deemed necessary, the appeals examiner shall promptly
5
1 issue the subpoena, unless such request is determined to be unreasonable.
2 Unless the claimant or the employer, within fourteen (14) days after service
3 of the decision of the appeals examiner, seeks judicial review pursuant to
4 section 45-619, Idaho Code, or unless an application or motion is made for a
5 rehearing of such decision, the decision of the appeals examiner shall be-
6 come final and the amount awarded by the decision shall become immediately
7 due and payable to the department. A decision that has become final may be
8 enforced by the department according to section 45-618, Idaho Code.
9 (8) (11) No person acting on behalf of the director shall participate in
10 any case in which he has a direct or indirect personal interest.
11 (9) (12)(a) Any right, fact, or matter in issue, directly based upon or
12 necessarily involved in a determination or decision of the appeals ex-
13 aminer that has become final, shall be conclusive for all the purposes
14 of this chapter as between the claimant and the employer who had notice
15 of such determination or decision. Subject to judicial review as set
16 forth in this chapter, any determination or decision shall be conclu-
17 sive for all purposes of this chapter and shall not be subject to collat-
18 eral attack irrespective of notice.
19 (b) No finding of fact or conclusion of law contained in a determination
20 or decision rendered pursuant to this chapter by an appeals examiner, a
21 court, or any other person authorized to make such determinations shall
22 have preclusive effect in any other action or proceeding, except pro-
23 ceedings that are brought:
24 (i) Pursuant to this chapter;
25 (ii) To collect wage claims; or
26 (iii) To challenge the constitutionality of provisions of this
27 chapter or administrative proceedings under this chapter.
28 SECTION 2. That Chapter 13, Title 72, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
29 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
30 ignated as Section 72-1303A, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
31 72-1303A. ABLE TO WORK -- AVAILABLE FOR SUITABLE WORK. (1) "Able to
32 work" means having the physical and mental ability to perform work for which
33 a claimant is qualified under conditions ordinarily existing during a normal
34 workweek. It does not mean that a person must be able to perform work in his
35 customary occupation or the same kind of work he last performed. A person
36 who is able to work only part of the workday or part of the workweek is not
37 considered able to work.
38 (2) An individual with a disability under the Americans with disabili-
39 ties act, 42 U.S.C. 12112, as defined by 29 CFR 1630.2(g), whose disability
40 prevents the claimant from working full time or during particular shifts is
41 not deemed unable to work or unavailable for work for as long as the claimant
42 demonstrates he is able to perform some work and remains available for work
43 to the full extent of his ability. A qualified claimant with a disability who
44 is able to work with or without a reasonable accommodation will be considered
45 as having complied with the requirement of being available for work when the
46 claimant is willing to work the maximum number of hours the claimant is able
47 to work. Qualified claimants with disabilities must meet all other eligi-
48 bility requirements, including the illness provisions of this section.
6
1 (3)(a) A claimant who withdraws from the labor market because of ill-
2 ness or injury prior to filing a claim is not eligible for unemployment
3 benefits until he is able and available for work; provided, no claimant
4 shall be considered ineligible with respect to any week of unemployment
5 for failure to comply with this section if the failure is due to an ill-
6 ness or disability that commences after applying for unemployment bene-
7 fits and no work that would have been suitable prior to the beginning of
8 the illness or injury has been offered the claimant.
9 (b) A person who claims benefits under this illness provision must re-
10 main available for job referral by the department; however, he may leave
11 the area for treatment of his illness and continue to be eligible under
12 the provisions of this section.
13 (4) "Available for suitable work" means remaining within and actively
14 seeking suitable work in a locality in which the individual has earned wages
15 subject to the provisions of this chapter during the individual's base pe-
16 riod or, if the individual moves his permanent residence outside of that lo-
17 cality, then in a locality where suitable work normally is performed. Being
18 available for suitable work encompasses a readiness, ability, and willing-
19 ness to work and to find a job, including the possibility of marketing the
20 claimant's services in the claimant's area of availability. The type of work
21 for which the claimant is available must exist in the claimant's area to the
22 extent that a normal unemployed person would generally find work within a
23 reasonable period of time.
24 (5) For the purposes of this section, "workweek" means:
25 (a) For an employer-attached or union-attached classification, the
26 claimant's normal workweek as defined by the employer or union;
27 (b) For a work-seeking classification, Monday through Friday, 8:00
28 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.; or
29 (c) For an approved training classification, regular class hours.
30 (6) Claimant work availability requirements are waived on Independence
31 Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day.
32 (7) A claimant seeking work must be willing to travel the distance nor-
33 mally traveled by other workers in his area and occupation.
34 (8) An individual who restricts availability to part-time work pur-
35 suant to section 72-1366(4)(d), Idaho Code, is considered fully employed and
36 ineligible to receive benefits if the individual works hours comparable to
37 the part-time work experience in the individual's base period. A claimant
38 must be available for a full workweek and a full, normal workday unless the
39 claimant establishes that the majority of weeks worked during the claimant's
40 base period were for less than full-time work, which is established where the
41 total base period wages divided by the claimant's last regular rate of pay
42 does not exceed two thousand seventy-nine (2,079) hours.
43 (9) A claimant who is incarcerated for any part of the workweek is not
44 eligible for benefits for that week, unless the claimant can establish he has
45 work release privileges that would provide him a reasonable opportunity to
46 meet his work search requirements and obtain full-time employment.
47 (10) A claimant who moves to a remote locality where there is little pos-
48 sibility of obtaining suitable work is not eligible for benefits.
49 (11) A public official who receives pay and performs full-time service
50 is considered employed and not eligible for benefits. Part-time officials,
7
1 even though receiving pay, may be considered available for work the same as
2 any other individual employed on a part-time basis.
3 (12) Performing public service, including voluntary non-remunerated
4 service, does not disqualify an individual for benefits as long as he meets
5 the other requirements of this section.
6 (13) A claimant who restricts his availability to only work done within
7 the home in a manner that severely limits the work available to him is not
8 eligible for benefits, unless the claimant works in an industry where tele-
9 working is common.
10 (14) A person who is attending school or a training course not approved
11 by the department pursuant to section 72-1366(8), Idaho Code, may be eligi-
12 ble for benefits if attendance does not conflict with that person's avail-
13 ability for work or for seeking work and if he will discontinue attendance
14 upon receipt of an offer of employment that creates a conflict between em-
15 ployment and the schooling or training.
16 (15) All claimants, regardless of their attachment to an industry or em-
17 ployer, must meet the same standard of remaining within their local labor
18 market area during the workweek in order to be considered available for work,
19 unless the primary purpose of a temporary absence is to seek work in another
20 labor market. Claimants otherwise eligible to receive benefits while par-
21 ticipating in an approved training program or course are not deemed ineli-
22 gible when the training or course occurs outside of their local labor market
23 due to the unavailability of similar programs or courses within their local
24 labor market.
25 (16) To remain eligible for benefits, claimants must remain within a
26 state, territory, or country included in the United States department of
27 labor's interstate benefit payment plan.
28 (17) A claimant who places unreasonable restrictions on working condi-
29 tions that significantly hinder his availability and search for work is not
30 eligible for benefits.
31 (18) A person on a vacation approved by his employer during time when
32 work is available is not eligible for benefits.
33 (19) A claimant is eligible for benefits if the wages or other condi-
34 tions of available work are substantially less favorable to the claimant
35 than those prevailing for similar work in the local area.
36 (20) A claimant is not eligible for benefits if he unduly restricts his
37 availability for work by insisting on a wage rate that is higher than the pre-
38 vailing wage for similar work in that area.
39 (21) The claimant's prior earnings and past experience are considered
40 in determining whether work is suitable.
41 (22) For the purpose of approving a waiver of the two (2) year limitation
42 on school or training courses specified by section 72-1366(8)(c)(ii), Idaho
43 Code, for claimants who lack skills to compete in the labor market, the fol-
44 lowing criteria must be met:
45 (a) The claimant must demonstrate a workable financial plan for com-
46 pleting the school or training course after his benefits have been ex-
47 hausted;
48 (b) The claimant must establish there is a demand for the occupation in
49 which the claimant will be trained. An occupation is considered in de-
8
1 mand when work opportunities are available and there is not a surplus of
2 qualified applicants; and
3 (c) At the time that the claimant applies for the waiver, the usual du-
4 ration of the school or training course is no longer than two (2) years.
5 SECTION 3. That Section 72-1304, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
6 amended to read as follows:
7 72-1304. AGRICULTURAL LABOR.
8 (1)(a) "Agricultural labor" means all services performed:
9 (a) (i) On a farm, in the employ of any person in connection with
10 cultivating the soil, or raising or harvesting any agricultural,
11 aquacultural or horticultural commodities, including the rais-
12 ing, shearing, feeding, caring for, training, and management of
13 livestock, bees, fish, poultry, furbearers, and wildlife;
14 (b) (ii) In the employ of the owner or tenant or other operator of a
15 farm in connection with the operation, management, conservation,
16 improvement, or maintenance of such farm and its tools and equip-
17 ment, or in salvaging timber or clearing land of brush and other
18 debris left by a hurricane if the major part of such service is per-
19 formed on a farm;
20 (c) (iii) In connection with the operation or maintenance of
21 ditches, canals, reservoirs, or waterways not owned or operated
22 for profit and used exclusively for supplying and storing water,
23 at least ninety percent (90%) of which was ultimately delivered
24 for agricultural purposes during the preceding calendar year; and
25 (d) (iv) In the employ of any farm operator or group of operators,
26 organized or unorganized, in handling, planting, drying, packing,
27 packaging, eviscerating, processing, freezing, grading, storing,
28 or delivering to storage or to market or to a carrier for trans-
29 portation to market in its unmanufactured state any agricultural,
30 aquacultural or horticultural commodities, if such operator or
31 group, in both the current and preceding calendar years, produced
32 more than one-half (1/2) of the commodities with respect to which
33 such service is performed.
34 (b) Whether a farm operator described in subsection (1)(a)(iv) of this
35 section produced more than one-half (1/2) of the commodities with re-
36 spect to services performed shall be determined based on:
37 (i) Quantity, where only one (1) commodity is processed; or
38 (ii) Wages, where multiple commodities are processed. The pro
39 rata share of wages paid for processing commodities raised by the
40 farm operator compared to the total wages paid for processing all
41 commodities shall determine whether a farm operator produced more
42 than one-half (1/2) of the commodities processed.
43 (c) This subsection is not applicable to services performed in commer-
44 cial canning, freezing, or dehydrating, or in connection with any agri-
45 cultural, aquacultural or horticultural commodity after its delivery
46 to a terminal market for distribution for consumption.
47 (2) "Custom farming" means "agricultural labor" for the purposes of
48 this chapter.
9
1 (3) "Farm" includes stock, dairy, fish, poultry, fruit, furbearer and
2 truck farms, plantations, ranches, nurseries, hatcheries, ranges, green-
3 houses or other similar structures used primarily for the raising of agri-
4 cultural, aquacultural or horticultural commodities, and orchards.
5 (4) "Unmanufactured state" means retention of its original form and
6 substance.
7 (5) "Terminal market" means a place of business to which products are
8 shipped in a sorted, graded, packaged condition, ready for immediate sale.

12 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-

41 SECTION 16. That Chapter 13, Title 72, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
42 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
43 ignated as Section 72-1328A, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
44 72-1328A. BOARD, LODGING, AND MEALS. (1) When board, lodging, meals,
45 or any other payment-in-kind comprise, in whole or in part, an employee's
46 wages, the value of such board, lodging, or other payment shall be determined
47 as follows:
48 (a) If a cash value is agreed upon in any contract of hire, the amount
49 so agreed upon shall be used if it is a reasonable fair market value. If
21
1 there is no agreement or if the contract of hire states an amount less
2 than a reasonable fair market value, the department shall determine the
3 reasonable fair market value to be used.
4 (b) The value of meals and lodging furnished by an employer to the
5 employee shall not be included in the employee's gross income when
6 furnished on the employer's business premises for the employer's con-
7 venience and, in the case of lodging but not meals, the employees are
8 required to accept the lodging in order to properly perform their duties
9 and as a condition of their employment.
10 (c) In order to exclude the value of lodging from an employee's gross
11 wages, the employer must show that the wages paid to the employee for
12 services performed meet the prevailing wage for those services. If the
13 employer's records do not show or establish that the employee received
14 the prevailing wage for services performed, then the reasonable fair
15 market value of the lodging shall be included as wages in the employee's
16 gross income.
17 (2) Meals or lodging furnished shall be considered for the employer's
18 convenience if the employer has a substantial business reason other than
19 providing additional remuneration to the employee. A statement that the
20 meals or lodging are not intended as remuneration is not sufficient to
21 establish that either meals or lodging are furnished for the employer's con-
22 venience.
23 (3) In the case of employees who receive remuneration in the form of
24 subsistence, such as groceries, staples, and fundamental shelter, the rea-
25 sonable fair market value of such subsistence shall be determined by the de-
26 partment.
27 SECTION 17. That Chapter 13, Title 72, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
28 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
29 ignated as Section 72-1330A, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
30 72-1330A. WORKPLACE MISCONDUCT. (1) "Workplace misconduct" means
31 conduct in connection with employment that willfully disregards the em-
32 ployer's interest, willfully violates the employer's reasonable rules, or
33 disregards a standard of behavior that the employer has a right to expect of
34 its employees.
35 (2) A claimant's conduct disregards a standard of behavior the employer
36 has a right to expect of its employees when the conduct falls below the stan-
37 dard of behavior expected by the employer and the employer's expectation was
38 objectively reasonable. There is no requirement that the claimant's conduct
39 be willful, intentional, or deliberate. The claimant's subjective state of
40 mind is not a relevant factor in determining workplace misconduct pursuant
41 to this subsection.
42 (3) An employer's expectation shall be considered objectively reason-
43 able when it is communicated to the employee or flows naturally from the em-
44 ployment relationship. An expectation that flows naturally need not be com-
45 municated to an employee to be considered objectively reasonable.
46 (4) Mere inefficiency, unsatisfactory conduct, inadvertencies, iso-
47 lated instances of ordinary negligence, good faith errors in judgment or
48 discretion, or failure to meet the performance expectations of the employer
22
1 because of inability or incapacity shall not be considered misconduct con-
2 nected with employment.
3 (5) Except as provided in section 72-1366(5), Idaho Code, conduct in-
4 volving personal, nonjob-related behavior occurring outside the workplace
5 shall not be considered workplace misconduct in connection with employment.
6 SECTION 18. That Section 72-1337, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
7 amended to read as follows:
8 72-1337. RECORDS AND REPORTS. (1) Each employer that is a "covered em-
9 ployer," as defined in section 72-1315, Idaho Code, shall complete and sub-
10 mit to the director an Idaho business registration form within six (6) months
11 of becoming a covered employer.
12 (2) Each employer, including those who are not covered employers, shall
13 keep accurate records, for such periods of time and containing such infor-
14 mation as the director may prescribe. Such records for a period of five (5)
15 years, including, without limitation:
16 (a) The full name and home address of the worker;
17 (b) The social security number of the worker;
18 (c) The place of work within the state;

20 after a temporary or partial layoff;
21 (e) The date on which the worker's employment was terminated;
22 (f) Whether the termination occurred by reason of:
23 (i) The worker's death;
24 (ii) The voluntary action by the worker and the reason given by the
25 worker; or
26 (iii) Discharge by the employer and the reason for the discharge;
27 (g) Wages paid for employment in each pay period and total wages for
28 all pay periods ending each quarter for the year, showing separately:
29 money wages, the cash value of other remuneration, and the amount of all
30 bonuses or commissions; and
31 (h) Amounts paid to a worker as an allowance or reimbursement for travel
32 and employee business expenses and the amounts of such expenditures ac-
33 tually incurred and accounted for.
34 (3) Employers that are liable to pay tax contributions, or that have
35 elected a cost reimbursement option in lieu of tax contributions, shall sub-
36 mit quarterly contribution reports in the form or medium designated by the
37 department.
38 (4)(a) Each contribution shall be accompanied by an employer's contri-
39 bution report. All contribution reports shall be filed electronically
40 with the department unless the employer has petitioned the department
41 in writing for a waiver and the department has granted a waiver allow-
42 ing the filing of a non-electronic contribution report. All contribu-
43 tion reports shall be in a form or medium prescribed and furnished or ap-
44 proved for such purpose by the department, giving such information as
45 may be required, including the number of individuals employed and wages
46 paid or payable to each. Every report must be signed, furnished, or ac-
47 knowledged by the covered employer or on the employer's behalf by a per-
48 son who has personal knowledge of the facts stated therein and who has
49 been authorized by the covered employer to submit the information.
23
1 (b) Each employer shall report all wages paid for services in covered
2 employment each calendar quarter. In the event a covered employer does
3 not pay wages during a calendar quarter, the employer shall file a quar-
4 terly report indicating that no wages were paid.
5 (c) The total wages and taxable wages shown on the contribution report
6 to be used in computing contributions due shall be reduced to the next
7 lower full dollar amount.
8 (d) An employer shall be covered for all four (4) quarters in the calen-
9 dar year in which the employer becomes a covered employer as well as for
10 all four (4) quarters in the succeeding calendar year. Employers are
11 not required to file quarterly reports until meeting the coverage cri-
12 teria pursuant to section 72-1315, Idaho Code. Upon becoming a covered
13 employer within a calendar year, the quarterly reports for the quarters
14 prior to the employer becoming covered shall be filed along with the
15 quarterly report for the quarter in which the employer became covered.
16 Quarterly reports for the periods subsequent to coverage shall be filed
17 when due after the end of each quarter.
18 (5)(a) Wages paid shall be assigned to the calendar quarter in which the
19 wages were:
20 (i) Actually paid to the employee in accordance with the em-
21 ployer's usual and customary payday as established by law or past
22 practice;
23 (ii) Due the employee in accordance with the employer's usual and
24 customary payday as established by law or past practice but not ac-
25 tually paid on such date because of circumstances beyond the con-
26 trol of the employer or the employee; or
27 (iii) Not paid on the usual or customary payday as established by
28 law or past practice but set apart on the employer's books as an
29 amount due and payable or otherwise recognized as a specific and
30 ascertainable amount due and payable to the worker in accordance
31 with an agreement or contract of hire under which services were
32 rendered.
33 (b) Payments to employees made prior to regular or established pay-
34 days shall be assignable and reportable during the quarter in which
35 they would have been paid unless a practice is established whereby all
36 employees or a class of employees are given an opportunity to take a reg-
37 ular advance against wages, which creates another customary payday.
38 (c) Amounts received as a result of labor relations awards or judg-
39 ments for back pay or for disputed wages constitute wages and shall be
40 reported in the quarter or quarters in which the award or judgment has
41 become final, after all appeals have been exhausted, or the quarter or
42 quarters to which the court assigns the wages, if different.
43 (d) Amounts awarded to the claimant as penalties or damages against the
44 employer, other than for lost wages, do not constitute wages.
45 (6) When wages paid cover services performed both in covered employment
46 and excluded employment, all employee wages shall be deemed to have been
47 earned in covered employment and shall be reported unless the employer's
48 records show the hours and wages for covered employment and excluded employ-
49 ment separately.
24
1 (7)(a) When remuneration paid includes payment in addition to wages for
2 services performed in covered employment, the employer's records shall
3 account for wages and other remuneration separately. When this distri-
4 bution is not shown on the records, the employee's entire remuneration
5 shall be deemed to be wages and shall be reported.
6 (b) When the amount paid to an employee includes remuneration for other
7 than personal services, such as equipment usage and travel costs, the
8 department shall determine the fair market value of the remuneration
9 for the employee's personal services. In making such determination,
10 the department shall consider the wages specified in the contract of
11 hire, the prevailing wages for similar work under comparable condi-
12 tions, and other pertinent factors. The wages so determined by the
13 department shall be reported by the employer.
14 (8) Each covered employer and any other employer requested by the de-
15 partment shall submit status reports on such form or online system as may be
16 prescribed and furnished by the director. The reports shall include such in-
17 formation as may be necessary for the department to make an initial or subse-
18 quent determination of status under this chapter and shall be signed by the
19 employer or the employer's representative duly authorized for such purpose.
20 (9)(a) To determine the taxable status of an employer, information
21 regarding the business activities of any person engaged in business in
22 Idaho shall be submitted to the department upon request, including,
23 without limitation, articles of incorporation, articles of organiza-
24 tion, minutes of boards of directors, financial reports, partnership
25 agreements, number of employees, wages paid, employment contracts,
26 income tax records, and any other records or other information that may
27 tend to establish such person's status.
28 (b) An employer shall be notified in writing of any determination as to
29 its liability for contributions or its status as a covered employer if a
30 formal determination was made after the employer questioned its status.
31 The determination shall become final if no appeal is taken to an appeals
32 examiner within fourteen (14) days of the determination pursuant to the
33 procedures set forth in section 72-1368, Idaho Code.
34 (c) The provisions of this section do not apply to any employer for whom
35 the services performed do not, by virtue of the provisions of section
36 72-1316, Idaho Code, constitute covered employment, except that the de-
37 partment may require any such employer to submit reports as provided in
38 this section.
39 (10) All persons, whether covered or not, shall make available to the
40 department all requested business records, including, without limitation,
41 journals, ledgers, time books, minute books, or any other records or infor-
42 mation that would tend to establish the existence of amounts paid for ser-
43 vices performed, whether or not in covered employment, and for information
44 necessary to assist in or enable collection efforts or any other investiga-
45 tions conducted by the department.
46 (11) Records shall be open to inspection and be subject to being copied
47 by the director at any reasonable time. The director, a member of the com-
48 mission, or an appeals examiner may require from any employer any sworn or
49 unsworn reports which are deemed necessary in the exercise of their duties.
25
1 (12) The department may commence an administrative proceeding for pur-
2 poses of establishing a tax liability or to otherwise enforce the provisions
3 of this chapter by issuing a determination at any time within five (5) years
4 from the due date of a quarterly report or the date a quarterly report is
5 filed, whichever is later, subject to tolling pursuant to section 72-1349,
6 Idaho Code.
7 (13) Covered employers shall furnish the department with all pertinent
8 data regarding their status when new or additional information is available.
9 (14)(a) All employers, including those who are not covered employers,
10 shall respond to department requests for the reasons for the separation
11 whenever the claimant:
12 (i) Left his employment voluntarily;
13 (ii) Was discharged from his employment due to workplace miscon-
14 duct;
15 (iii) Is unemployed due to a strike, lockout, or other labor dis-
16 pute;

26 amended to read as follows:
27 72-1342. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. (1) Employment security informa-
28 tion, as defined in section 74-106(7), Idaho Code, shall be exempt from dis-
29 closure as provided in chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, except that such in-
30 formation may be disclosed as is necessary for the proper administration of
31 programs under this chapter or may be made available to public officials for
32 use in the performance of official duties subject to such restrictions and
33 fees as the director may by rule prescribe.
34 (2) The director may shall by rule or department policy establish con-
35 fidentiality and disclosure procedures to comply with the requirements of 20
36 CFR 603 and the provisions of chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, including pro-
37 cedures that prescribe the form of written, informed consent by a person that
38 is adequate for disclosure of employment security information pertaining to
39 that person to a third party, as provided in section 74-106(7), Idaho Code,
40 and the security requirements and cost provisions that apply to such disclo-
41 sures.
42 SECTION 20. That Section 72-1349, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
43 amended to read as follows:
44 72-1349. PAYMENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS -- LIMITATION OF ACTIONS. (1) Con-
45 tributions shall be reported and paid to the department on taxable wages for
46 each calendar year equal to the amount determined in accordance with section
47 72-1350, Idaho Code. Contributions on wages paid to an individual under an-
26
1 other state unemployment insurance law, or paid by an employer's predecessor
2 during the calendar year, shall be counted in complying with this provision.
3 (2) Contributions shall accrue and become reportable and payable to the
4 department by each covered employer for each calendar quarter with respect
5 to wages for covered employment. Such contributions shall become due and
6 be paid by each covered employer to the director for the employment security
7 fund and shall not be deducted from the wages of individuals employed by such
8 employer. All moneys required to be paid by a covered employer pursuant to
9 this chapter shall immediately, upon becoming due and payable, become or be
10 deemed money belonging to the state, and every covered employer shall hold
11 or be deemed to hold said money separately, aside, or in trust from any other
12 funds, moneys or accounts, for the state of Idaho for payment in the manner
13 and at the times provided by law.
14 (3) The contributions reportable and payable to the department by each
15 covered employer, with respect to covered employment, and accruing in each
16 calendar quarter, shall be reported and paid to the department on or before
17 the last day of the month following the close of said calendar quarter. If
18 the normal due date falls on a weekend or holiday, the next business day shall
19 be the due date for contributions.
20 (4) Each amount shall be deemed to have been paid on the date that the
21 department receives payment thereof in cash or by check or other order for
22 the payment of money honored by the drawer on presentment. If sent through
23 the mail, the amount shall be deemed to have been paid as of the date mailed as
24 evidenced by the postmark on the envelope containing the contribution.
25 (5) Application of contribution payments shall be done in accordance
26 with department rule or policy.
27 (4) (6) The director may, for good cause shown by a covered employer,
28 extend the time for payment of his contributions or any part thereof, but no
29 such extension of time shall postpone the due date more than sixty (60) days.
30 Contributions with respect to which an extension of time for payment has been
31 granted shall be paid on or before the last day of the period of the exten-
32 sion.
33 (5) (7) Whenever it appears to be essential to the proper administra-
34 tion of this chapter that collection of the contributions of a covered em-
35 ployer must be made more often than quarterly, the director shall have au-
36 thority to demand payment of the contributions forthwith.
37 (6) (8) In accordance with rules the director may prescribe, any person
38 or persons entering into a formal contract with the state, any county, city,
39 town, school or irrigation district, or any quasi-public corporation of the
40 state, for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building
41 or public work, the contract price of which exceeds the sum of one thousand
42 dollars ($1,000), may be required before commencing such work, to execute a
43 surety bond in an amount sufficient to cover contributions when due. If the
44 director, who shall approve said bond, determines that said bond has become
45 insufficient, he may require that a new bond be provided in the amount he di-
46 rects. Failure on the part of the employer covered by the bond to pay the full
47 amount of his contributions when due shall render the surety liable on said
48 bond as though the surety was the employer and subject to the other provi-
49 sions of this chapter.
27
1 (7) (9) In the payment of any contributions a fractional part of a dol-
2 lar shall be disregarded unless it amounts to fifty cents (50¢) or more, in
3 which case it shall be increased to one dollar ($1.00).
4 (8) (10) The director may commence administrative proceedings to en-
5 force the provisions of this section by issuing a determination at any time
6 within five (5) years of the due date of a quarterly report or the date a
7 quarterly report is filed, whichever is later. The limitation period of
8 this subsection (8) is tolled during any period in which the employer ab-
9 sconds from the state, during any period of the employer's concealment, or
10 during any period when the department's ability to commence administrative
11 proceedings to enforce the provisions of this section is stayed by legal
12 proceedings.
13 SECTION 21. That Section 72-1349B, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
14 hereby amended to read as follows:
15 72-1349B. FINANCING OF BENEFITS PAYMENTS BY PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYERS
16 AND THEIR CLIENTS. (1) Nonprofit organizations and governmental entities
17 excepted. Financing of benefits for workers assigned by a professional em-
18 ployer to a nonprofit organization or a governmental entity shall be paid as
19 provided in section 72-1349A, Idaho Code. Financing of benefits for workers
20 assigned by a professional employer to any entity other than a nonprofit
21 organization or governmental entity shall be made in accordance with the
22 provisions of this section.
23 (2) A professional employer organization shall fully comply with the
24 requirements of chapter 24, title 44, Idaho Code, in order to be eligible for
25 any transfers of experience rating as allowed by this section.
26 (3) In order to effect a transfer of a client's experience rating into
27 the experience rating of a professional employer organization, both the
28 client and the professional employer organization shall jointly apply for
29 the transfer of the experience rating within the same time frames as required
30 of employers by section 72-1351(5), Idaho Code, from the date of the contract
31 entered into between the professional employer organization and the client
32 required by section 44-2405, Idaho Code. Failure to submit a timely joint
33 request for transfer of experience rating shall result in the professional
34 employer organization reporting wages for the client under the employer ac-
35 count number of the client.
36 (4) In the event that a client and a professional employer organization
37 jointly apply to transfer the experience rating of the client into that of
38 the professional employer organization, the client's entire experience rat-
39 ing and factors of experience rating shall be transferred into that of the
40 professional employer organization, and no partial transfers of experience
41 factors or the experience rating shall be allowed.
42 (5) If some of the client's workers are included in the professional em-
43 ployer organization arrangement and some are not included, and the profes-
44 sional employer organization and the client elect to report the workers in-
45 cluded in the professional employer organization arrangement under the em-
46 ployer account number of the client, then only one (1) quarterly report shall
47 be remitted to the department, which shall list or include all the client's
48 workers whether or not included in the professional employer organization
49 arrangement.
28
1 (6) If a client employer has employees, services, or employment, one
2 (1) or more of which do not independently meet the coverage or threshold
3 requirements necessary to constitute covered employment, such employees,
4 services, or employment shall nonetheless be deemed to meet the coverage
5 requirements of this chapter if, in combination with other employees, ser-
6 vices, or employment of such other employees of the professional employer
7 organization or any of its clients, such wages, services, or employees
8 jointly meet coverage requirements.
9 (2) (7) Liability for contributions. Unless a professional employer
10 meets the minimum requirements of this chapter, its client shall remain li-
11 able as a covered employer for any payments due under the provisions of this
12 chapter. During the term of a professional employer arrangement, a profes-
13 sional employer is liable for the payment of all moneys due pursuant to this
14 chapter as a result of wages paid to employees assigned to a client company,
15 except compensation paid to sole proprietors or partners in the client com-
16 pany.
17 (3) (8) Joint and several liability. A client is jointly and severally
18 liable for any unpaid moneys due under the provisions of this chapter from
19 the professional employer for wages paid to workers assigned to the client.
20 (4) (9) Reporting requirements. The professional employer shall re-
21 port and make all payments under its state employer account number. The
22 professional employer shall keep separate records and submit separate
23 quarterly wage reports for each of its clients. The professional employer
24 shall pay contributions for its clients collectively using the professional
25 employer's contribution rate unless it elects to pay the contribution for
26 certain clients individually in which instance the contribution shall be
27 paid using the individual client's contribution rate.
28 (10) To report the wages and employees covered by the professional
29 employer organization arrangement between a professional employer organ-
30 ization and client, professional employer organizations and their clients
31 shall make reports to the department in one (1) of the following ways, sub-
32 ject to any conditions in rules promulgated by the department:
33 (a) Report the workers included in the professional employer organiza-
34 tion arrangement under the employer account number of the professional
35 employer organization and transfer the rating of the client to the pro-
36 fessional employer organization; or
37 (b) Report the workers included in the professional employer organiza-
38 tion arrangement under the employer account number of the client with-
39 out an experience rating transfer.
40 (5) (11) Interested party. As between a professional employer and its
41 client, the professional employer company shall be deemed to be the inter-
42 ested party for purposes of section 72-1323, Idaho Code, and all proceedings
43 to determine rights to benefits under the provisions of this chapter.
44 (6) (12) Temporary workers. The provisions of this section do not apply
45 to an entity that provides temporary workers on a temporary help basis, pro-
46 vided that the entity is liable as the employer for all payments due under the
47 provisions of this chapter as a result of wages paid to those temporary work-
48 ers.
49 (7) (13) Rebuttable presumption. When a professional employer assigns
50 workers to only one (1) client and its affiliates, there is a rebuttable pre-
29
1 sumption that the client entered into a professional employer arrangement to
2 avoid calculation of the proper taxable wage rate. If the professional em-
3 ployer fails to rebut this presumption, the director, pursuant to section
4 72-1353, Idaho Code, shall issue an administrative determination of cover-
5 age holding the client to be the covered employer for purposes of this chap-
6 ter.
7 (8) (14) A client ceasing to pay wages. Whenever a client ceases to pay
8 wages, such client shall be subject to termination of its employer account
9 and experience rating records in the same manner as any other employer, in
10 accordance with the provisions of sections 72-1351 and 72-1352, Idaho Code.
11 If a client which that has ceased to pay wages subsequently becomes subject
12 to this chapter because it resumes paying wages, it will be assigned the
13 appropriate experience rate in accordance with the provisions of section
14 72-1351, Idaho Code.
15 (9) (15) Succession of experience factors. Whenever a professional em-
16 ployer arrangement is entered, the separate account and experience factors
17 of payroll and reserve shall be transferred to the professional employer for
18 the purpose of determining the professional employer's contribution rate to
19 be paid on behalf of the client. Upon the expiration or termination of the
20 professional employer arrangement, so much of the professional employer's
21 separate account and experience factors of payroll and reserve as is attrib-
22 utable to the client shall be transferred to the terminating client for the
23 purpose of determining the client's subsequent rate of contribution. In the
24 event the professional employer elects to pay the client's contribution sep-
25 arately as provided in subsection (4) (9) of this section, then the client's
26 experience factors of payroll and reserve shall remain with the client em-
27 ployer for the duration of the professional employer arrangement.
28 SECTION 22. That Section 72-1350, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
29 amended to read as follows:
30 72-1350. TAXABLE WAGE BASE AND TAXABLE WAGE RATES. (1) All remunera-
31 tion for personal services as defined in section 72-1328, Idaho Code, equal
32 to the average annual wage in covered employment for the penultimate cal-
33 endar year, rounded to the nearest multiple of one hundred dollars ($100)
34 or the amount of taxable wage base specified in the federal unemployment
35 tax act, whichever is higher, shall be the taxable wage base for purposes of
36 this chapter. For the purpose of determining the taxable wage base under
37 this chapter, the average annual wage is computed by dividing that calendar
38 year's total wages in covered employment, excluding state government and
39 cost reimbursement employers, by the average number of workers in covered
40 employment for that calendar year as derived from data reported to the de-
41 partment by covered employers.
42 (2) Prior to December 31 of each year, the director shall determine the
43 taxable wage rates for the following calendar year for all covered employ-
44 ers, except cost reimbursement employers, in accordance with this section.
45 If the desired fund size multiplier set forth in subsection (3) of this
46 section is revised with an effective date that is prior to January 1 of the
47 following year, the director shall issue adjusted taxable wage rates as soon
48 as practicable and in accordance with the revised multiplier's effective
49 date. Employers shall receive a credit against future taxes under this act
30
1 for any overpayments resulting from tax payments made before the amended
2 taxable wage rates are adjusted.
3 (3) An average high-cost ratio shall be determined by calculating the
4 average of the three (3) highest benefit cost rates in the twenty (20) year
5 period ending with the preceding year. For the purposes of this section, the
6 "benefit cost rate" is the total annual benefits paid, including the state's
7 share of extended benefits but excluding the federal share of extended ben-
8 efits and cost-reimbursable benefits, divided by the total annual covered
9 wages excluding cost-reimbursable wages. The resulting average high-cost
10 ratio is multiplied by the desired fund size multiplier, and the result, for
11 the purposes of this section, is referred to as the "average high-cost mul-
12 tiple" (AHCM). The desired fund size multiplier shall decrease from one and
13 three-tenths (1.3) to one and two-tenths (1.2) on and after January 1, 2024.
14 (4) The fund balance ratio shall be determined by dividing the actual
15 balance of the employment security fund, section 72-1346, Idaho Code, and
16 the reserve fund, section 72-1347A, Idaho Code, on September 30 of the cur-
17 rent calendar year by the wages paid by all covered employers in Idaho, ex-
18 cept cost-reimbursement employers, in the preceding calendar year.
19 (5) The base tax rate shall be determined as follows:
20 (a) Divide the fund balance ratio by the AHCM;
21 (b) Subtract the quotient obtained from the calculation in paragraph
22 (a) of this subsection from the number two (2);
23 (c) Multiply the remainder obtained from the calculation in paragraph
24 (b) of this subsection by two and one-tenth percent (2.1%). The product
25 obtained from this calculation shall equal the base tax rate, provided
26 that the base tax rate shall not be less than six-tenths percent (0.6%)
27 and shall not exceed three and four-tenths percent (3.4%).
28 (6) The base tax rate calculated in accordance with subsection (5) of
29 this section shall be used to determine the taxable wage rate effective the
30 following calendar year for all covered employers except cost-reimbursement
31 employers as provided in subsections (7) and (8) of this section, except that
32 the base tax rate for calendar years 2022 and 2023 shall be equal to the base
33 tax rate calculated for calendar year 2021.

20 (8) Each covered employer, except cost-reimbursement employers, will
21 be assigned a taxable wage rate and a contribution rate as follows:
22 (a) Each employer, except standard-rated employers, will be assigned
23 to one (1) of the rate classes for eligible and deficit employers pro-
24 vided in subsection (7) of this section based on the employer's experi-
25 ence as determined under the provisions of sections 72-1319, 72-1319A,
26 72-1351 and 72-1351A, Idaho Code.
27 (b) For each rate class provided in subsection (7) of this section, the
28 department will multiply the base tax rate determined in accordance
29 with subsection (5) of this section by the tax factor listed for that
30 rate class in the table provided in subsection (7) of this section. The
31 product obtained from this calculation shall be the taxable wage rate
32 for employers assigned to that rate class, provided that the taxable
33 wage rate shall not be less than the minimum taxable wage rate assigned
34 to that rate class and shall not exceed the maximum taxable wage rate
35 assigned to that rate class in the table provided in subsection (7) of
36 this section.
37 (c) For standard-rated employers, the department will multiply the
38 base tax rate determined in accordance with subsection (5) of this
39 section by the tax factor listed for standard-rated employers in the
40 table provided in subsection (7) of this section. The product obtained
41 from this calculation shall be the taxable wage rate for standard-rated
42 employers, provided that the taxable wage rate shall not be less than
43 the minimum taxable wage rate assigned to standard-rated employers
32
1 and shall not exceed the maximum taxable wage rate assigned to stan-
2 dard-rated employers in the table provided in subsection (7) of this
3 section.
4 (d) Deficit employers who have been assigned a taxable wage rate from
5 deficit rate class 6 will be assigned contribution rates equal to their
6 taxable wage rate.
7 (e) All other eligible, standard-rated, and deficit employers will
8 be assigned contribution rates equal to ninety-seven percent (97%) of
9 their taxable wage rate. Provided however, that for each calendar year
10 a reserve tax is imposed pursuant to section 72-1347A, Idaho Code, the
11 contribution rates for employers assigned contribution rates pursuant
12 to this paragraph shall be eighty percent (80%) of their taxable wage
13 rate.
14 (9) Each employer shall be notified of his taxable wage rate as deter-
15 mined for any calendar year pursuant to this section and section 72-1351,
16 Idaho Code. Such determination shall become conclusive and binding upon
17 the employer, unless within fourteen (14) days after notice as provided in
18 section 72-1368(5), Idaho Code, the employer files an application for re-
19 determination, setting forth his reasons therefor. Reconsideration shall
20 be limited to transactions occurring subsequent to any previous determina-
21 tion that has become final. The employer shall be promptly notified of the
22 redetermination, which shall become final unless an appeal is filed within
23 fourteen (14) days after notice as provided in section 72-1368(5), Idaho
24 Code. Proceedings on the appeal shall be in accordance with the provisions
25 of section 72-1361, Idaho Code.
26 SECTION 23. That Section 72-1351, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
27 amended to read as follows:
28 72-1351. EXPERIENCE RATING AND VOLUNTARY TRANSFERS OF EXPERIENCE RAT-
29 ING ACCOUNTS. (1) Subject to the other provisions of this chapter, each eli-
30 gible and deficit employer's, except cost reimbursement employers, taxable
31 wage rate shall be determined in the manner set forth in this subsection for
32 each calendar year:
33 (a)(i) Each eligible employer shall be given an "experience fac-
34 tor" which shall be the ratio of excess of contributions over ben-
35 efits paid on the employer's account since December 31, 1939, to
36 his average annual taxable payroll rounded to the next lower dol-
37 lar amount for the four (4) fiscal years immediately preceding the
38 computation date, except that when an employer first becomes eli-
39 gible, his "experience factor" will be computed on his average an-
40 nual taxable payroll for the two (2) fiscal years or more, but not
41 to exceed four (4) fiscal years, immediately preceding the compu-
42 tation date. The computation of such "experience factor" shall be
43 to six (6) decimal places.
44 (ii) Each deficit employer shall be given a "deficit experience
45 factor" which shall be the ratio of excess of benefits paid on the
46 employer's account over contributions since December 31, 1939, to
47 his average annual taxable payroll rounded to the next lower dol-
48 lar amount for one (1) or more fiscal years, but not to exceed four
49 (4) fiscal years, for which he had covered employment ending on
33
1 the computation date; provided, however, that any employer who, on
2 any computation date has a "deficit experience factor" for the pe-
3 riod immediately preceding such computation date but who has filed
4 all reports, paid all contributions and penalties due on or before
5 the cutoff date, and has during the last four (4) fiscal years paid
6 contributions at a rate of not less than the standard rate applica-
7 ble for each such year and in excess of benefits charged to his ex-
8 perience rating account during such years, shall have any balance
9 of benefits charged to his account, which on the computation date
10 immediately preceding such four (4) fiscal years was in excess of
11 contributions paid, deleted from his account, and the excess ben-
12 efits so deleted shall not be considered in the computation of his
13 taxable wage rate for the rate years following such four (4) fiscal
14 years. For the rate year following such computation date, he shall
15 be given the standard rate for that year.
16 (iii) In the event an employer's coverage has been terminated be-
17 cause he has ceased to do business or because he has not had covered
18 employment for a period of four (4) years, and if said employer
19 thereafter becomes a covered employer, he will be considered as
20 though he were a new employer, and he shall not be credited with his
21 previous experience under this chapter for the purpose of comput-
22 ing any future "experience factor."
23 (iv) Benefits paid to a claimant whose employment terminated be-
24 cause the claimant's employer was called to active military duty
25 shall not be used as a factor in determining the taxable wage rate
26 of that employer.
27 (b) Schedules shall be prepared listing all eligible employers in in-
28 verse numerical order of their experience factors, and all deficit em-
29 ployers in numerical order of their deficit experience factors. There
30 shall be listed on such schedules for each such employer in addition to
31 the experience factor: (i) the amount of his taxable payroll for the
32 fiscal year ending on the computation date, and (ii) a cumulative total
33 consisting of the sum of such employer's taxable payroll for the fiscal
34 year ending on the computation date and the corresponding taxable pay-
35 rolls for all other employers preceding him on such schedules.
36 (c) The cumulative taxable payroll amounts listed on the schedules pro-
37 vided for in paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be segregated into
38 groups whose limits shall be those set out in the table provided in sec-
39 tion 72-1350(7), Idaho Code. Each of such groups shall be identified
40 by the rate class number listed in the table which represents the per-
41 centage limits of each group. Each employer on the schedules shall be
42 assigned a taxable wage rate in accordance with section 72-1350, Idaho
43 Code.
44 (d)(i) If the grouping of rate classes requires the inclusion of
45 exactly one-half (1/2) of an employer's taxable payroll, the em-
46 ployer shall be assigned the lower of the two (2) rates designated
47 for the two (2) classes in which the halves of his taxable payroll
48 are so required.
49 (ii) If the group of rate classes requires the inclusion of a por-
50 tion other than exactly one-half (1/2) of an employer's taxable
34
1 payroll, the employer shall be assigned the rate designated for
2 the class in which the greater part of his taxable payroll is so re-
3 quired.
4 (iii) If one (1) or more employers on the schedules have experi-
5 ence factors identical to that of the last employer included in a
6 particular rate class, all such employers shall be included in and
7 assigned the taxable wage rate specified for such class, notwith-
8 standing the provisions of paragraph (c) of this subsection.
9 (e) If the taxable payroll amount or the experience factor or both
10 such taxable payroll amount and experience factor of any eligible or
11 deficit employer listed on the schedules is changed, the employer shall
12 be placed in that position on the schedules which he would have occu-
13 pied had his taxable payroll amount and/or experience factor as changed
14 been used in determining his position in the first instance, but such
15 change shall not affect the position or rate classification of any other
16 employer listed on the schedules and shall not affect the rate determi-
17 nation for previous years.
18 (2) For experience rating purposes, all previously accumulated benefit
19 charges to covered employers' accounts, except cost reimbursement employ-
20 ers, shall not be changed except as provided in this chapter. Benefits paid
21 prior to June 30 shall, as of June 30 of each year preceding the calendar year
22 for which a covered employer's taxable wage rate is effective, be charged to
23 the account of the covered employer, except cost reimbursement employers,
24 who paid the largest individual amount of base period wages as shown on the
25 determination used as the basis for the payment of such benefits, except that
26 no charge shall be made to the account of such covered employer with respect
27 to benefits paid under the following situations:
28 (a) If paid to a worker who terminated his services voluntarily without
29 good cause attributable to such covered employer, with good cause but
30 for reasons not attributable to such covered employer, or who had been
31 discharged for workplace misconduct in connection with such services;
32 (b) If paid in accordance with the provisions of section 72-1368(10),
33 Idaho Code, and the decision to pay benefits is subsequently reversed;
34 (c) For that portion of benefits paid to multistate claimants pursuant
35 to section 72-1344, Idaho Code, which exceeds the amount of benefits
36 that would have been charged had only Idaho wages been used in paying the
37 claim;
38 (d) If paid in accordance with the extended benefit program triggered
39 by either national or state indicators;
40 (e) If paid to a worker who continues to perform services for such cov-
41 ered employer without a reduction in his customary work schedule, and
42 who is eligible to receive benefits due to layoff or a reduction in earn-
43 ings from another employer; or
44 (f) If paid to a worker who turns down an offer of suitable work because
45 of participation in a job training program pursuant to the requirements
46 of section 72-1366(8), Idaho Code.
47 (3) A covered employer whose experience rating account is chargeable,
48 as prescribed by this section, is an interested party as defined in sec-
49 tion 72-1323, Idaho Code. A determination of chargeability shall become
50 final unless, within fourteen (14) days after notice as provided in section
35
1 72-1368(5), Idaho Code, an appeal is filed by an interested party with the
2 department in accordance with the department's rules. Appeal proceedings
3 shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 72-1361, Idaho Code.
4 (4)(a) An experience rating record shall be maintained for each covered
5 employer. The record shall be credited with all contributions which the
6 covered employer has paid for covered employment prior to the cutoff
7 date, pursuant to the provisions of this and preceding acts, and which
8 covered employment occurred prior to the computation date. The record
9 shall also be charged with the amount of benefits paid which are charge-
10 able to the covered employer's account as provided by the appropriate
11 provisions of the employment security law and regulations thereunder
12 in effect at the time such benefits were paid. Nothing in this section
13 shall be construed to grant any covered employer or individual in his
14 service a priority with respect to any claim or right because of amounts
15 paid by such covered employer into the employment security fund.
16 (b) Except those meeting the requirements of section 72-1349B, Idaho
17 Code, each person or entity paying wages directly, or indirectly
18 through arrangements in which payroll is consolidated for multiple per-
19 sons or entities, shall maintain separate records and shall report the
20 wages in accordance with this chapter. The wages for one (1) person or
21 entity may not be reported under the assigned record of another, even
22 where the people or entities are related.
23 (5)(a) Whenever any individual or type of organization, whether or not
24 a covered employer within the meaning of section 72-1315, Idaho Code,
25 in any manner succeeds to, or acquires all or substantially all, of the
26 business of an employer who at the time of acquisition was a covered
27 employer, and in respect to whom the director finds that the business
28 of the predecessor is continued solely by the successor, the separate
29 experience rating account of the predecessor shall, upon the joint ap-
30 plication of the predecessor and the successor within the one hundred
31 eighty (180) days after such acquisition and approval by the director,
32 be transferred to the successor employer for the purpose of determining
33 such successor's liability and taxable wage rate, and any successor who
34 was not an employer on the date of acquisition shall, as of such date,
35 become a covered employer as defined in this chapter. Such one hundred
36 eighty (180) day period may be extended at the discretion of the direc-
37 tor.
38 (b) Whenever any individual or type of organization, whether or not a
39 covered employer within the meaning of section 72-1315, Idaho Code, in
40 any manner succeeds to, or acquires, part of the business of an employer
41 who at the time of acquisition was a covered employer, and such portion
42 of the business is continued by the successor, so much of the separate
43 experience rating account of the predecessor as is attributable to the
44 portion of the business transferred, as determined on a pro rata basis
45 in the same ratio that the wages of covered employees properly allocable
46 to the transferred portion of the business bears to the payroll of the
47 predecessor in the last four (4) completed calendar quarters immedi-
48 ately preceding the date of transfer, shall, upon the joint application
49 of the predecessor and the successor within one hundred eighty (180)
50 days after such acquisition and approval by the director, be trans-
36
1 ferred to the successor employer for the purpose of determining such
2 successor's liability and taxable wage rate, and any successor who was
3 not an employer on the date of acquisition shall, as of such date, become
4 a covered employer as defined in this chapter. Such one hundred eighty
5 (180) day period may be extended at the discretion of the director.
6 (c)(i) If the successor was a covered employer prior to the date
7 of the acquisition of all or a part of the predecessor's business,
8 his taxable wage rate, effective the first day of the calendar
9 quarter immediately following the date of acquisition, shall be a
10 newly computed rate based on the combined experience of the prede-
11 cessor and successor, the resulting rate remaining in effect the
12 balance of the rate year.
13 (ii) If the successor was not a covered employer prior to the date
14 of the acquisition of all or a part of the predecessor's business,
15 his rate shall be the rate applicable to the predecessor with re-
16 spect to the period immediately preceding the date of acquisition,
17 but if there were was more than one (1) predecessor, the succes-
18 sor's rate shall be a newly computed rate based on the combined ex-
19 perience of the predecessors, becoming effective immediately af-
20 ter the date of acquisition, and shall remain in effect the balance
21 of the rate year.

23 count shall consist of the actual contribution, benefit and taxable
24 payroll experience of the employer and any amounts due from the employer

29 SECTION 24. That Section 72-1351A, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
30 hereby amended to read as follows:
31 72-1351A. MANDATORY TRANSFERS OF EXPERIENCE RATING ACCOUNTS AND FED-
32 ERAL CONFORMITY PROVISIONS REGARDING TRANSFERS OF EXPERIENCE AND ASSIGNMENT
33 OF RATES. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the following
34 shall apply regarding transfers of experience and assignment of rates:
35 (1)(a) If a covered employer transfers its trade or business, or a por-
36 tion thereof, to another employer, whether or not a covered employer
37 within the meaning of section 72-1315, Idaho Code, and, at the time of
38 the transfer, there is substantially common ownership, management or
39 control of the two (2) employers, then the experience rating account
40 attributable to the transferred trade or business shall be transferred
41 to the employer to whom such business is so transferred. The rates of
42 both employers shall be recalculated using the methods provided in sec-
43 tion 72-1351(5)(b) and either (c)(i) or (c)(ii), Idaho Code. Whenever
44 such mandatory transfer involves only a portion of the experience rat-
45 ing record, and the predecessor or successor employers fail within ten
46 (10) days after notice to supply the required payroll information, the
47 transfer may be based on estimates of the allocable payrolls.
48 (i) For partial transfers of an experience rating record, the pro
49 rata share of the experience rate to be transferred shall be com-
37
1 puted based on the four (4) most recently completed quarters re-
2 ported by the predecessor employer prior to the date of acquisi-
3 tion or change in entity.
4 (ii) When a total transfer of experience rating record has been
5 completed and the predecessor employer continues to have employ-
6 ment in connection with the liquidation of his business, the pre-
7 decessor employer shall continue to pay contributions at the as-
8 signed rate for the period of liquidation but not beyond the bal-
9 ance of the rate year.
10 (iii) In determining whether the ownership or management or con-
11 trol of a successor employer is substantially the same as the own-
12 ership or management or control of the predecessor employer, fac-
13 tors to be considered include, without limitation, the extent of
14 policy-making authority, the involvement in daily management of
15 operations, the supervision over the workforce, the percentage of
16 ownership of shares or assets, and the involvement on boards of di-
17 rectors or other controlling bodies.
18 (iv) A successor employer may use wages paid by the predecessor
19 employer to arrive at the wage base for purposes of calculating
20 taxable wages only when the experience rate of a predecessor em-
21 ployer has been transferred to a successor employer.
22 (b) If, following a transfer of experience under paragraph (a) of this
23 subsection, the director determines that a substantial purpose of the
24 transfer of the trade or business was to obtain a reduced liability for
25 contributions, then the experience rating accounts of the employers in-
26 volved shall be combined into a single account and a single rate shall be
27 assigned to such account.
28 (2) Whenever a person who is not a covered employer under this chapter
29 at the time such person acquires the trade or business of a covered employer,
30 the experience rating account of the acquired business shall not be trans-
31 ferred to such person if the director finds that such person acquired the
32 business primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contribu-
33 tions. Instead, such person shall be assigned the standard rate for new
34 employers under section 72-1350, Idaho Code. In determining whether the
35 trade or business was acquired primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower
36 rate of contributions, the director shall use objective factors which may
37 include, but are not limited to, the cost of acquiring the business, whether
38 the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired business, how
39 long such business enterprise was continued, or whether a substantial number
40 of new employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the busi-
41 ness activity conducted prior to acquisition.
42 (3)(a) It shall be a violation of this section if a person:
43 (i) Makes any false statement to the department when the maker
44 knows the statement to be false or acts with deliberate ignorance
45 of or reckless disregard for the truth of the matter or willfully
46 fails to disclose a material fact to the department in connection
47 with the transfer of a trade or business;
48 (ii) Prepares any false or antedated report, form, book, paper,
49 record, written instrument, or other matter or thing in connection
38
1 with the transfer of a trade or business with the intent to submit
2 it or allow it to be submitted to the department as genuine or true;
3 (iii) Knowingly violates or attempts to violate subsection (1) or
4 (2) of this section or any other provision of this chapter related
5 to determining the assignment of a contribution rate or an experi-
6 ence rate; or
7 (iv) Knowingly advises another person in a way that results in a
8 violation or an attempted violation of subsection (1) or (2) of
9 this section or any other provision of this chapter related to de-
10 termining the assignment of a contribution rate or an experience
11 rate.
12 (b) If a person commits any of the acts described in paragraph (a) of
13 this subsection, the person shall be subject to the following penal-
14 ties:
15 (i) If the person is a covered employer, a civil money penalty of
16 ten percent (10%) of such person's taxable wages for the four (4)
17 completed consecutive quarters preceding the violation shall be
18 imposed for such year and said penalty shall be deposited in the
19 state employment security administrative and reimbursement fund
20 as established by section 72-1348, Idaho Code.
21 (ii) If the person is not a covered employer, such person shall
22 be subject to a civil money penalty of not more than five thousand
23 dollars ($5,000) for each violation. Any such penalty shall be de-
24 posited in the state employment security administrative and reim-
25 bursement fund as established by section 72-1348, Idaho Code.
26 (4) Every person who knowingly makes any false statement to the depart-
27 ment or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact to the department in con-
28 nection with the transfer of a trade or business, or knowingly prepares any
29 false or antedated report, form, book, paper, record, written instrument, or
30 other matter or thing in connection with the transfer of a trade or business
31 with the intent to submit it or allow it to be submitted to the department
32 as genuine or true, or knowingly violates or attempts to violate subsection
33 (1) or (2) of this section or any other provision of this chapter related to
34 determining the assignment of a contribution rate or an experience rate, or
35 knowingly advises another person to act in a way that results in a violation
36 or an attempted violation of subsection (1) or (2) of this section or any
37 other provision of this chapter related to determining the assignment of a
38 contribution rate or an experience rate, shall be guilty of a felony punish-
39 able as provided in section 18-112, Idaho Code.
40 (5) For purposes of this section:
41 (a) An employer's experience rating account shall consist of

43 taxable payroll experience of the employer and any amounts due from the
44 employer under this chapter. When a transferred experience rating ac-

47 and severally liable for those amounts.

49 erate ignorance of or reckless disregard for the prohibition involved.

3 (d) A "transfer of a trade or business" occurs whenever a person in any
4 manner acquires or succeeds to all or a portion of a trade or business.
5 Factors the department may consider when determining whether a transfer
6 of a trade or business has occurred include, but are not limited to, the
7 following:
8 (i) Whether the successor continued the business enterprise of
9 the acquired business;
10 (ii) Whether the successor purchased, leased or assumed ma-
11 chinery and manufacturing equipment, office equipment, business
12 premises, the business or corporate name, inventories, a covenant
13 not to compete or a list of customers;
14 (iii) Continuity of business relationships with third parties
15 such as vendors, suppliers and subcontractors;
16 (iv) A transfer of good will;
17 (v) A transfer of accounts receivable;
18 (vi) Possession and use of the predecessor's sales correspon-
19 dence; and
20 (vii) Whether the employees remained the same.
21 (e) "Trade or business" includes, but is not limited to, the employer's
22 workforce. The transfer of some or all of an employer's workforce to
23 another employer shall be considered a transfer of a trade or business
24 when, as the result of such transfer, the transferring employer no
25 longer performs trade or business with respect to the transferred work-
26 force, and such trade or business is performed by the employer to whom
27 the workforce is transferred.
28 (f) "Violates or attempts to violate" includes, but is not limited to,

38 ment in accordance with the department's rules. Appeal proceedings shall be

32 participate in the job training course during any week with respect to
33 which he claims benefits or credit to his waiting period, the claimant
34 shall be ineligible for that week if he was not able to work nor avail-
35 able for suitable work, to be determined as follows: The claimant shall
36 be ineligible unless he is making satisfactory progress in the training
37 and his failure to attend or otherwise participate was due to:
38 (i) The claimant's illness or disability that occurred after he
39 had filed a claim and the claimant missed fewer than one-half (1/2)
40 of the classes available to him that week; or
41 (ii) Compelling personal circumstances, provided that the
42 claimant missed fewer than one-half (1/2) of the classes available
43 to him that week.
44 (d) A claimant shall not be denied regular unemployment benefits under
45 any provision of this chapter relating to availability for work, active
46 search for work or refusal to accept work solely because the claimant is
47 seeking only part-time work if the department determines that a major-
48 ity of the weeks of work in the claimant's base period were for less than
49 full-time work. For the purpose of this subsection, "seeking only part-
50 time work" is defined as seeking work that has comparable hours to the
46
1 claimant's part-time work experience in the base period, except that a
2 claimant must be available for at least twenty (20) hours of work per
3 week.
4 (e) A claimant must seek work as directed by the department. A claimant
5 must meet the requirements of the code to which the claimant is as-
6 signed. Failure to comply with work-seeking requirements will result
7 in a denial of benefits. For the purpose of administering the work
8 search requirements of this subsection and subsection (6) of this
9 section, a claimant will be coded according to his attachment to an em-
10 ployer or industry, as follows:
11 (i) Attached. A claimant who has a firm attachment to an em-
12 ployer, industry, or union, or who is temporarily or seasonally
13 unemployed, and expects to return to his former job or employer
14 in a reasonable length of time not to exceed sixteen (16) weeks,
15 provided the claimant maintains reasonable contact with his em-
16 ployer. If during the sixteen (16) weeks the claimant returns to
17 work temporarily for the job attached employer, the claimant's
18 period of job attachment will be extended by one (1) week for each
19 week of verified full-time employment as defined by this chapter;
20 (ii) Work-seeking. A claimant who possesses marketable skills in
21 an occupation, but has no immediate prospects for reemployment,
22 and whose employment expectations, wages, hours, and other condi-
23 tions of employment are realistic in relation to the normal labor
24 market supply and demand in his area of availability; or
25 (iii) Approved training. A claimant who is assigned to a training
26 course under the provisions of subsection (8) of this section.
27 (f) A claimant must provide or be capable of obtaining a license or per-
28 mit if required by law for performance of the work.
29 (g) A claimant must apply for and accept a lower or beginning pay rate
30 for employment if he has no prospects for a better-paying job in the lo-
31 cality.
32 (h) A claimant who is regularly employed on a seasonal basis must be
33 available for other types of work in the off-season to be eligible for
34 benefits.
35 (5)(a) The claimant's unemployment is not due to the claimant voluntar-
36 ily leaving employment without good cause connected with the claimant's
37 employment or because of the claimant's discharge for workplace miscon-
38 duct in connection with the claimant's employment.
39 (b) The requirement that good cause for a voluntary leaving of employ-
40 ment be in connection with employment does not apply and good cause is
41 shown where a claimant demonstrates that:
42 (a)(i) The leaving was necessary to protect the claimant or any
43 minor child of the claimant from domestic violence or the leaving
44 was due to domestic violence that caused the claimant to rea-
45 sonably believe that the claimant's continued employment would
46 jeopardize the safety of the claimant or any minor child of the
47 claimant; and (ii) The the claimant made all reasonable efforts to
48 preserve the employment; or
49 (b) (ii) The claimant is a military spouse who voluntarily
50 left the claimant's most recent employment to relocate with the
47
1 claimant's spouse who, because of a permanent change of station
2 orders, was required to move to a location from which the commute
3 to the claimant's most recent employment was impractical, but
4 only if, before leaving, the claimant took reasonable actions to
5 maintain the employment relationship through accommodation dis-
6 cussions with the claimant's employer.; or
7 (iii) The claimant quit a temporary job for a permanent job or quit
8 part-time employment for employment with an increase in the number
9 of hours worked.
10 (c) The following definitions apply to this subsection:
11 (i) "Domestic violence" is as defined in section 39-6303, Idaho
12 Code, and also includes the crime of stalking in the second degree
13 pursuant to section 18-7906, Idaho Code;
14 (ii) "Military spouse" means the spouse of a member of the armed
15 forces of the United States or a reserve component of the armed
16 forces of the United States stationed in this state in accordance
17 with military orders or stationed in this state before a reassign-
18 ment to duties outside this state; and
19 (iii) "Permanent change of station orders" means the assignment,
20 reassignment, or transfer of a member of the armed forces of the
21 United States or a reserve component of the armed forces of the
22 United States from the member's present duty station or location
23 without return to the previous duty station or location.
24 (d) Good cause connected with employment exists when a claimant's rea-
25 sons for leaving the employment arise from the working conditions, job
26 tasks, or employment agreement. If the claimant's reasons for leaving
27 the employment arise from personal or other matters unrelated to em-
28 ployment, the reasons are not connected with the claimant's employment.
29 (i) The standard of what constitutes good cause is the standard
30 of reasonableness as applied to the average adult. Whether good
31 cause is present depends on whether a reasonable person would con-
32 sider the circumstances resulting in the claimant's unemployment
33 to be real, substantial, and compelling.
34 (ii) A claimant who leaves a job because of a reasonable and seri-
35 ous objection to the work requirements of the employer on moral or
36 ethical grounds and is otherwise eligible shall not be denied ben-
37 efits.
38 (iii) A claimant whose unemployment is due to his health or physi-
39 cal condition that makes it impossible for him to continue to per-
40 form the duties of the job shall be deemed to have quit work with
41 good cause connected with employment.
42 (iv) An individual who has continuing suitable work available and
43 who voluntarily elects to retire or to terminate employment during
44 a period of reorganization or downsizing shall be deemed to have
45 voluntarily quit the employment for personal reasons.
46 (v) The eligibility of a claimant discharged before a pending
47 resignation has occurred for reasons unrelated to the pending res-
48 ignation shall be determined on the basis of the discharge.
49 (vi) If a claimant had given notice of a pending resignation but
50 was discharged before the effective date of the resignation, both
48
1 separations shall be considered. The following three (3) elements
2 must be present for both actions to affect the claimant's eligi-
3 bility:
4 1. The employee gave notice to the employer of a specific
5 separation date;
6 2. The employer's decision to discharge the claimant before
7 the effective date of the resignation was a consequence of
8 the pending separation; and
9 3. The discharge occurred a short time prior to the effec-
10 tive date of the resignation.
11 (vii) Good cause for quitting employment may be established by
12 showing the claimant was subjected to harassment that is unlawful
13 pursuant to the provisions of chapter 59, title 67, Idaho Code.
14 (e) If a claimant has resigned after receiving a notice of discharge or
15 lay off due to a lack of work, but before the effective date of the dis-
16 charge, both separations shall be considered. The following three (3)
17 elements must be present for both actions to affect the claimant's eli-
18 gibility:
19 (i) The employee was given notice by the employer of a specific
20 separation date;
21 (ii) The employee's decision to quit before the effective date of
22 the termination was a consequence of the pending separation; and
23 (iii) The voluntary quit occurred a short time prior to the effec-
24 tive date of the termination.
25 (f) A claimant who has been suspended without pay for an indefinite pe-
26 riod of time and who has not been given a date to return to work shall be
27 considered discharged.
28 (6)(a) The claimant's unemployment is not due to his failure without
29 good cause to apply for available suitable work or to accept suitable
30 work within seven (7) days of when it is offered to him, unless a con-
31 dition specified in subsection (8) of this section applies or the job
32 offered does not constitute suitable employment pursuant to the pro-
33 visions of subsection (9) of this section. A claimant has the respon-
34 sibility to apply for and accept suitable work. The longer a claimant
35 has been unemployed, the more willing he must be to seek other types
36 of work and accept work at a lower rate of pay. Failure to appear for a
37 previously scheduled job interview without notifying the employer of
38 the need to cancel or reschedule shall constitute a failure to apply for
39 suitable work for that week.
40 (b) The department shall establish an email address and web portal that
41 allows employers to report suspected violations of this subsection. As
42 part of its regular communication with employers, the department shall
43 at least annually inform employers of the email address and web portal
44 described in this subsection and the mechanism to report suspected vio-
45 lations.
46 (c) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, a good cause
47 reason for not applying for available and suitable work or responding to
48 an offer of suitable employment shall be found only if the claimant is
49 ill, injured, or delayed by reason of an accident or medical emergency
50 involving the claimant or a member of the claimant's immediate family.
49
1 (d) To have good cause to refuse to apply for or accept available suit-
2 able work because of personal circumstances, a claimant must show that
3 his circumstances were so compelling that a reasonably prudent individ-
4 ual would have acted in the same manner under the same circumstances.
5 For purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, good cause includes
6 but is not limited to circumstances where:
7 (i) The work would require the claimant to work on days contrary
8 to his religious convictions;
9 (ii) The claimant has reasonable, serious objections to the work
10 or the workplace on moral or ethical grounds;
11 (iii) The claimant has excellent prospects for more suitable work
12 with his former employer or in his regular occupation;
13 (iv) The claimant is unable to meet an employer's restrictions on
14 citizenship or residency;
15 (v) The travel distance to available work is excessive or unrea-
16 sonable. A claimant is ineligible if he fails to apply for and ac-
17 cept suitable work within a commuting area similar to other work-
18 ers in his area and occupation; and
19 (vi) The claimant cannot meet government requirements within a
20 reasonable period of time.
21 (e) A claimant shall be ineligible for benefits if:
22 (i) The claimant causes an employer to withdraw an offer of suit-
23 able work or terminate the offer after the claimant has accepted
24 it;
25 (ii) The claimant fails without good cause to comply with rea-
26 sonable, lawful requirements that are typical of certain occupa-
27 tions, such as a requirement that a worker be bonded;
28 (iii) The claimant, after being laid off, fails to return to work
29 on the date specified by the employer at the time of layoff or fails
30 to respond to a callback after a layoff; and
31 (iv) The claimant fails to report to the department when so di-
32 rected, fails to follow explicit instructions for applying for
33 available suitable work, or fails to report to work after accept-
34 ing employment, without good cause.
35 (f) A claimant must be available for and willing to accept suitable
36 part-time work in the absence of suitable full-time work.
37 (7) In determining whether or not work is suitable for an individual,
38 the degree of risk involved to his health, safety, morals, physical fitness,
39 experience, training, past earnings, length of unemployment and prospects
40 for obtaining local employment in his customary occupation, the distance of
41 the work from his residence, and other pertinent factors shall be consid-
42 ered. No employment shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall not be de-
43 nied to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work or
44 to hold himself available for work under any of the following conditions:
45 (a) If the vacancy of the position offered is due directly to a strike,
46 lockout, or other labor dispute;
47 (b) If the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are
48 below those prevailing for similar work in the locality of the work of-
49 fered;
50
1 (c) If, as a condition of being employed, the individual would be re-
2 quired to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining
3 any bona fide labor organization.
4 (8) No claimant who is otherwise eligible shall be denied benefits for
5 any week due to an inability to comply with the requirements contained in
6 subsections (4)(a)(i) and (6) of this section if:
7 (a) The claimant is a participant in a program sponsored by title I of
8 the workforce innovation and opportunity act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq., as
9 amended) and attends a job training course under that program; or
10 (b) The claimant attends a job training course authorized pursuant to
11 the provisions of section 236(a)(1) of the trade act of 1974 or the North
12 American free trade agreement implementation act.
13 (c) The claimant lacks skills to compete in the labor market and attends
14 a job training course with the approval of the director. The director
15 may approve job training courses that meet the following criteria:
16 (i) The purpose of the job training is to teach the claimant
17 skills that will enhance the claimant's opportunities for employ-
18 ment; and
19 (ii) The job training can be completed within two (2) years, ex-
20 cept that this requirement may be waived pursuant to rules that the
21 director may prescribe.
22 (9) No claimant who is otherwise eligible shall be denied benefits
23 under subsection (5) of this section for leaving employment to attend job
24 training pursuant to subsection (8) of this section, provided that the
25 claimant obtained the employment after enrollment in or during scheduled
26 breaks in the job training course or that the employment was not suitable.
27 For purposes of this subsection, the term "suitable employment" means work
28 of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the individual's past
29 employment and wages for such work are no less than eighty percent (80%) of
30 the average weekly wage in the individual's past employment.
31 (10)(a) A claimant shall not be eligible to receive benefits for any
32 week with respect to which it is found that his unemployment is due to a
33 labor dispute; provided, that this subsection shall not apply if it is
34 shown that:
35 (a) (i) The claimant is not participating, financing, aiding,
36 abetting, or directly interested in the labor dispute; and
37 (b) (ii) The claimant does not belong to a grade or class of work-
38 ers with members who are employed at the premises at which the la-
39 bor dispute occurs and who are participating in or directly inter-
40 ested in the dispute.
41 (b) For purposes of this section, "labor dispute" means a controversy
42 with respect to wages, hours, working conditions, or right of represen-
43 tation affecting the work or employment of a number of individuals em-
44 ployed for hire that results in a deadlock or impasse between the con-
45 tending parties.
46 (c) A claimant may not be denied benefits because of a labor dispute
47 if the dispute is not in any way directly connected with the factory,
48 establishment, or premises at which the individual is or was last em-
49 ployed.
51
1 (d) A claimant's unemployment shall be deemed to be due to lack of work
2 and not due to a labor dispute if it is shown that because of the labor
3 dispute the employer's business has fallen off to the extent that the
4 employer can no longer utilize the services of the claimant due to the
5 drop in business.
6 (e) A claimant laid off because of lack of work from an employer where a
7 labor dispute later occurred shall not be considered unemployed due to
8 the labor dispute.
9 (f) The period of ineligibility under this section applies for the
10 whole of any week in which any part of a claimant's unemployment is due
11 to a labor dispute.
12 (g) The act of picketing the work site of a labor dispute constitutes
13 participation in the labor dispute, whether or not payment is made for
14 such services.
15 (h) Voluntary refusal to cross a peaceable picket line to work consti-
16 tutes participation in a labor dispute.
17 (i) Subsequent employment does not make the claimant eligible for ben-
18 efits if his unemployment is still due to the labor dispute. As long as
19 the claimant intends to return to the employer where the labor dispute
20 exists, his unemployment shall be considered due to the labor dispute
21 regardless of any intervening employment.
22 (j) The period of ineligibility due to the labor dispute terminates at
23 the end of the calendar week in which the labor dispute no longer exists.
24 The termination of the dispute does not automatically make a claimant
25 eligible for benefits.
26 (k) The fact that an individual is a dues-paying union member alone does
27 not constitute financing a labor dispute, and the fact that he is not a
28 union member does not establish that he is not financing or participat-
29 ing in the dispute.
30 (11) A claimant shall not be entitled to benefits for any week with re-
31 spect to which or a part of which he has received or is seeking benefits un-
32 der an unemployment insurance law of another state or of the United States;
33 provided, that if the appropriate agency of such other state or of the United
34 States shall finally determine that he is not entitled to such unemployment
35 compensation or insurance benefits, he shall not by the provisions of this
36 subsection be denied benefits. For purposes of this section, a law of the
37 United States providing any payments of any type and in any amounts for pe-
38 riods of unemployment due to involuntary unemployment shall be considered an
39 unemployment insurance law of the United States.
40 (12) A claimant shall not be entitled to benefits for a period of
41 fifty-two (52) weeks if it is determined that he has willfully made a false
42 statement or willfully failed to report a material fact in order to obtain
43 benefits. The period of disqualification shall commence the week the deter-
44 mination is issued. The claimant shall also be ineligible for waiting week
45 credit and shall repay any sums received for any week for which the claimant
46 received waiting week credit or benefits as a result of having willfully
47 made a false statement or willfully failed to report a material fact. The
48 claimant shall also be ineligible for waiting week credit or benefits for any
49 week in which he owes the department an overpayment, civil penalty, or inter-
52
1 est resulting from a determination that he willfully made a false statement
2 or willfully failed to report a material fact.
3 (13) A claimant shall not be entitled to benefits if his principal oc-
4 cupation is self-employment. A claimant who performs incidental work in
5 self-employment shall show that self-employment does not interfere with his
6 availability for suitable work and that he continues to seek suitable work.
7 (14) A claimant who has been found ineligible for benefits under the
8 provisions of subsection (5), (6), (7) or (9) of this section shall reestab-
9 lish his eligibility by having obtained bona fide work and received wages
10 therefor in an amount of at least fourteen (14) times his weekly benefit
11 amount.
12 (15) Benefits based on service in employment defined in sections
13 72-1349A and 72-1352(3), Idaho Code, shall be payable in the same amount, on
14 the same terms and subject to the same conditions as benefits payable on the
15 basis of other service subject to this act.
16 (a) If the services performed during one-half (1/2) or more of any con-
17 tract period by an individual for an educational institution as defined
18 in section 72-1322B, Idaho Code, are in an instructional, research, or
19 principal administrative capacity, all the services shall be deemed to
20 be in such capacity.
21 (b) If the services performed during less than one-half (1/2) of any
22 contract period by an individual for an educational institution are in
23 an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity, none
24 of the services shall be deemed to be in such capacity.
25 (c) As used in this section, "contract period" means the entire period
26 for which the individual contracts to perform services, pursuant to the
27 terms of the contract.
28 (16) No claimant is eligible to receive benefits in two (2) successive
29 benefit years unless, after the beginning of the first benefit year during
30 which he received benefits, he performed service and earned an amount equal
31 to no less than six (6) times the weekly benefit amount established during
32 the first benefit year.
33 (17)(a) Benefits based on wages earned for services performed in an
34 instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an
35 educational institution shall not be paid for any week of unemployment
36 commencing during the period between two (2) successive academic years,
37 or during a similar period between two (2) terms whether or not succes-
38 sive, or during a period of paid sabbatical leave provided for in the
39 individual's contract, to any individual who performs such services in
40 the first academic year (or term) and has a contract to perform services
41 in any such capacity for any educational institution in the second aca-
42 demic year or term or has been given reasonable assurance that such a
43 contract will be offered.
44 (b) Benefits based on wages earned for services performed in any other
45 capacity for an educational institution shall not be paid to any indi-
46 vidual for any week that commences during a period between two (2) suc-
47 cessive school years or terms if the individual performs such services
48 in the first school year or term and there is a contract or reasonable
49 assurance that the individual will perform such services in the second
50 school year or term. If benefits are denied to any individual under this
53
1 paragraph and the individual was not offered an opportunity to perform
2 such services for the educational institution for the second academic
3 year or term, the individual shall be entitled to a retroactive payment
4 of benefits for each week for which the individual filed a timely claim
5 for benefits and for which benefits were denied solely by reason of this
6 paragraph.
7 (c) With respect to any services described in paragraphs (a) and (b)
8 of this subsection, benefits shall not be paid nor waiting week credit
9 given to an individual for wages earned for services for any week that
10 commences during an established and customary vacation period or holi-
11 day recess if the individual performed the services in the period imme-
12 diately before the vacation period or holiday recess and there is a rea-
13 sonable assurance the individual will perform such services in the pe-
14 riod immediately following such vacation period or holiday recess.
15 (d) With respect to any services described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
16 this subsection, benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services
17 in any capacities specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this sub-
18 section to any individual who performed such services in an educational
19 institution while in the employ of an educational service agency. For
20 purposes of this paragraph, the term "educational service agency" means
21 a governmental entity that is established and operated exclusively for
22 the purpose of providing such services to one (1) or more educational
23 institutions.
24 (e) "Reasonable assurance" of continuing employment exists when an ed-
25 ucational institution or service agency provides a written statement to
26 the department confirming that the claimant has been given a bona fide
27 offer of a specific job in the second academic period and explaining the
28 circumstances of the offer. In addition, for such reasonable assurance
29 to exist, the terms and conditions of the job offered in the second pe-
30 riod must not be substantially less favorable than the terms and condi-
31 tions of the job performed in the first period.
32 (f) A claimant who initially was determined not to have a reasonable
33 assurance of continuing employment shall subsequently become disquali-
34 fied for benefits under this section when an educational institution or
35 service agency gives the claimant such reasonable assurance.
36 (g) A claimant seeking retroactive payments pursuant to paragraph (b)
37 of this subsection must make a request for the retroactive payment with
38 the department no later than thirty (30) days after the beginning of the
39 second school year or term or retroactive payment will not be made.
40 (h) Employees of educational institutions hired under contract for the
41 school term are considered unemployed between school terms even though
42 they may receive their salary in twelve (12) monthly payments.
43 (18)(a) Benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services that
44 substantially consist of participating in sports or athletic events or
45 training or preparing to participate for any week that commences during
46 the period between two (2) successive sport seasons (or similar peri-
47 ods) if the individual performed services in the first season (or simi-
48 lar period) and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will
49 perform such services in the later of such seasons (or similar period).
54
1 (b) No base period wages shall be used to establish a claim when sub-
2 stantially all services performed during the base period consist of
3 participation in sports, athletic events, training, or preparing to so
4 participate, for any week that commences during the period between two
5 (2) successive sport seasons or similar periods if the individual per-
6 formed such services in the first season or similar period and there is a
7 reasonable assurance that the individual will perform such services in
8 the later of such seasons or similar periods.
9 (c) For purposes of this subsection, "reasonable assurance" does not
10 exist unless:
11 (i) The claimant has a contract, either written or oral;
12 (ii) The claimant offered to work and the employer expressed an
13 interest in hiring the player for the next season or similar pe-
14 riod; or
15 (iii) The claimant expresses a readiness and willingness or in-
16 tent to participate in the sport the following season or similar
17 period.
18 (d) Reasonable assurance exists if the claimant intends to pursue em-
19 ployment as a professional athlete the next season despite not having a
20 specific employer to return to or a formal offer of employment.
21 (e) An individual is deemed to have performed "substantially all ser-
22 vices" in sports, athletic events, training, or preparing to so partic-
23 ipate if ninety percent (90%) or more of the base period wages were based
24 on such services.
25 (19)(a) Benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services performed
26 by an alien unless the alien was lawfully admitted for permanent resi-
27 dence at the time such services were performed, was lawfully present for
28 purposes of performing such services, or was permanently residing in
29 the United States under color of law at the time the services were per-
30 formed (including an alien who was lawfully present in the United States
31 as a result of the application of the provisions of sections 207 and 208
32 or section 212(d)(5) of the immigration and nationality act).
33 (b) Any data or information required of individuals applying for bene-
34 fits to determine eligibility under this subsection shall be uniformly
35 required from all applicants for benefits.
36 (c) A decision to deny benefits under this subsection must be based on a
37 preponderance of the evidence.
38 (20) An individual who has been determined to be likely to exhaust regu-
39 lar benefits and to need reemployment services pursuant to a profiling sys-
40 tem established by the director must participate in those reemployment ser-
41 vices, unless:
42 (a) The individual has completed such services; or
43 (b) There is justifiable cause, as determined by the director, for the
44 claimant's failure to participate in such services.
45 (21)(a) A claimant:
46 (i) Who has been assigned to work for one (1) or more customers of
47 a staffing service; and
48 (ii) Who, at the time of hire by the staffing service, signed a
49 written notice informing him that completion or termination of an

1 assignment for a customer would not, of itself, terminate the em-
2 ployment relationship with the staffing service;
3 will not be considered unemployed upon completion or termination of an
4 assignment until such time as he contacts the staffing service to deter-
5 mine if further suitable work is available. If the claimant:
6 1. Contacts the staffing service and refuses a suitable work
7 assignment that is offered to him at that time, he will be
8 considered to have voluntarily quit that employment; or
9 2. Contacts the staffing service and the service does not
10 have a suitable work assignment for him, he will be consid-
11 ered unemployed due to a lack of work; or
12 3. Accepts new employment without first contacting the
13 staffing service for additional work, he will be considered
14 to have voluntarily quit employment with the staffing ser-
15 vice.
16 (b) For the purposes of this subsection, the term "staffing service"
17 means any person who assigns individuals to work for its customers and
18 includes but is not limited to professional employers as defined in
19 chapter 24, title 44, Idaho Code, and the employers of temporary employ-
20 ees as defined in section 44-2403(7), Idaho Code.
21 (22)(a) A claimant who is otherwise eligible for regular benefits as
22 defined in section 72-1367A(1)(e), Idaho Code, shall be eligible for
23 training extension benefits if the department determines that all of
24 the following criteria are met:
25 (i) The claimant is unemployed;
26 (ii) The claimant has exhausted all rights to regular unem-
27 ployment benefits as defined in section 72-1367A(1)(e), Idaho
28 Code, and all rights to extended benefits as defined in section
29 72-1367A(1)(f), Idaho Code, and all rights to benefits under sec-
30 tion 2002 (increase in unemployment compensation benefits) of
31 division B, title II, the assistance for unemployed workers and
32 struggling families act, of the American recovery and reinvest-
33 ment act of 2009, P.L. 111-5, as enacted on February 17, 2009;
34 (iii) The claimant is enrolled in a training program approved by
35 the department or in a job training program authorized under the
36 workforce innovation and opportunity act; except that the train-
37 ing program must prepare the claimant for entry into a high-demand
38 occupation if the department determines that the claimant sepa-
39 rated from a declining occupation or has been involuntarily and
40 indefinitely separated from employment as a result of a permanent
41 reduction of operations at the claimant's place of employment.
42 For the purposes of this subsection, a "declining occupation"
43 is one where there is a lack of sufficient current demand in the
44 claimant's labor market area for the occupational skills for which
45 the claimant is qualified by training and experience or current
46 physical or mental capacity and the lack of employment opportuni-
47 ties is expected to continue for an extended period of time, or the
48 claimant's occupation is one for which there is a seasonal vari-
49 ation in demand in the labor market and the claimant has no other
50 skills for which there is current demand. For the purposes of this
56
1 subsection, a "high-demand occupation" is an occupation in a labor
2 market area where work opportunities are available and qualified
3 applicants are lacking as determined by the use of available labor
4 market information;
5 (iv) The claimant is making satisfactory progress to complete the
6 training as determined by the department; and
7 (v) The claimant is not receiving similar stipends or other train-
8 ing allowances for nontraining costs. For the purposes of this
9 subsection, "similar stipend" means an amount provided under a
10 program with similar aims, such as providing training to increase
11 employability, and in approximately the same amounts.
12 (b) The weekly training extension benefit amount shall equal the
13 claimant's weekly benefit amount for the most recent benefit year less
14 any deductible income as determined by the provisions of this chapter.
15 The total amount of training extension benefits payable to a claimant
16 shall be equal to twenty-six (26) times the claimant's average weekly
17 benefit amount for the most recent benefit year. A claimant who is
18 receiving training extension benefits shall not be denied training ex-
19 tension benefits due to the application of subsections (4)(a)(i) and
20 (6) of this section, and an employer's account shall not be charged for
21 training extension benefits paid to the claimant.
22 SECTION 29. That Section 72-1367, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
23 amended to read as follows:
24 72-1367. BENEFIT FORMULA. (1) To be eligible an individual shall have
25 the minimum qualifying amount of wages in covered employment in at least one
26 (1) calendar quarter of his base period, and shall have total base period
27 wages of at least one and one-quarter (1 1/4) times his high quarter wages.
28 The minimum qualifying amount of wages shall be determined each January 1 and
29 shall equal fifty percent (50%) of the product of the state minimum wage, as
30 defined by section 44-1502, Idaho Code, multiplied by five hundred twenty
31 (520) hours, rounded to the lowest multiple of twenty-six (26).
32 (2) The weekly benefit amount shall be one twenty-sixth (1/26) of high-
33 est quarter wages except that it shall not exceed the applicable maximum
34 weekly benefit amount. The maximum weekly benefit amount shall be estab-
35 lished by the director, who shall determine the state average weekly wage
36 paid by covered employers for the preceding calendar year and the maximum
37 weekly benefit amount to be effective for new claims filed in the first full
38 week of the following January and filed thereafter until a new maximum weekly
39 benefit amount becomes effective under this subsection. The average weekly
40 wage shall be computed by dividing the total wages paid in covered employ-
41 ment, including state government and cost reimbursement employers, for the
42 preceding calendar year, as computed from data reported to the department
43 by covered employers, by the monthly average number of workers in covered
44 employment for the preceding calendar year and then dividing the result-
45 ing figure by fifty-two (52). The maximum weekly benefit amount shall be
46 fifty-five percent (55%) of the state average weekly wage paid by covered
47 employers for the preceding calendar year.
48 (3) Any eligible individual shall be entitled during any benefit year
49 to a total amount of benefits equal to his weekly benefit amount times the
57
1 number of full weeks of benefit entitlement appearing in the following table
2 based on his ratio of total base period earnings to highest quarter base pe-
3 riod earnings. The maximum weeks of entitlement are based on a sliding scale
4 of the official forecasted, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the
5 state for a minimum of ten (10) weeks to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks
6 depending on the unemployment rate in effect for the months of February, May,
7 August and November as follows:
8 (a) For any benefit week commencing in January through March of a calen-
9 dar year, the maximum allowed number of benefit weeks shall be based on
10 the unemployment rate for the preceding month of November;
11 (b) For any benefit week commencing in April through June of a calendar
12 year, the maximum allowed number of benefit weeks shall be based on the
13 unemployment rate for the preceding month of February;
14 (c) For any benefit week commencing in July through September of a cal-
15 endar year, the maximum allowed number of benefit weeks shall be based
16 on the unemployment rate for the preceding month of May; and
17 (d) For any benefit week commencing in October through December of a
18 calendar year, the maximum allowed number of benefit weeks shall be
19 based on the unemployment rate for the preceding month of August.

1 (4) If the total wages payable to an individual for less than full-time
2 work performed in a week claimed exceed one-half (1/2) of his weekly benefit
3 amount, the amount of wages that exceed one-half (1/2) of the weekly benefit
4 amount shall be deducted from the benefits payable to the claimant. For pur-
5 poses of this subsection, severance pay shall be deemed wages, even if the
6 claimant was required to sign a release of claims as a condition of receiving
7 the pay from the employer. "Severance pay" means a payment or payments made
8 to a claimant by an employer as a result of the severance of the employment
9 relationship.
10 (5) Benefits payable to an individual shall be rounded to the next lower
11 full dollar amount.

25 4. If the position pays wages less than the higher of:

2 the extended benefits account established for the benefit year.
3 (c) Section 3304 (a)(9)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 shall
4 not apply to any denial of benefits required under this subsection.
5 (5) Weekly extended benefit amount. The weekly extended benefit amount
6 payable to an individual for a week of total unemployment in his eligibility
7 period shall be an amount equal to the weekly benefit amount payable to him

23 for which the individual first claims such benefits.
24 (iv) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, if the
25 benefit year of any individual ends within an extended benefit pe-
26 riod, the remaining balance of extended benefits that such indi-
27 vidual would, but for the provisions of this section, be entitled
28 to receive in that extended benefit period, with respect to weeks
29 of unemployment beginning after the end of the benefit year, shall
30 be reduced, but not below zero (0), by the product of the number of
31 weeks for which the individual received any amounts as trade read-
32 justment allowances within that benefit year, multiplied by the
33 individual's weekly benefit amount for extended benefits.
34 (b)(i) Effective with respect to weeks beginning in a high unem-
35 ployment period, subsection (6)(a) of this section shall be ap-
36 plied by substituting:

48 an extended benefit period is to become effective in this state as a re-
49 sult of a state "on" indicator, or an extended benefit period is to be
65
1 terminated in this state as a result of a state "off" indicator, the di-
2 rector shall make a public announcement.
3 (b) Computations required by the provisions of subsection (1)(d) of
4 this section shall be made by the director, in accordance with regula-
5 tions prescribed by the United States secretary of labor.
6 (8) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, none of the
7 benefits paid pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be charged to
8 an employer's account for purposes of experience rating.
9 (9) Whenever a program of unemployment benefits becomes available that
10 is financed entirely by the federal government, and such program will not
11 allow payments to individuals who are entitled to extended benefits pur-
12 suant to this section, the governor may, by executive order, trigger off an
13 extended benefit period as defined in subsection (1)(a) of this section in
14 order to provide payment of such federal benefits to individuals who have
15 exhausted their right to regular benefits. When the federal benefits are
16 exhausted, or if the director determines that payment of extended benefits
17 would be more economically advantageous to the state of Idaho, the governor
18 shall, by executive order, trigger extended benefits on if the criteria of
19 subsection (1)(b) of this section are otherwise met.
20 (10) Until conformity with the federal-state extended unemployment
21 compensation act of 1970 requires otherwise, the eligibility requirements
22 in subsections (1)(j) and (3)(d) of this section are suspended. Except
23 where inconsistent with the provisions of this section, the eligibility re-
24 quirements of section 72-1366, Idaho Code, applicable to claims for regular
25 benefits shall apply in lieu of the suspended provisions.
26 SECTION 31. That Section 72-1368, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
27 amended to read as follows:
28 72-1368. CLAIMS FOR BENEFITS -- APPELLATE PROCEDURE -- LIMITATION OF
29 ACTIONS. (1) Claims for benefits shall be made in accordance with this chap-
30 ter and such rules as the director may prescribe.
31 (2) Each employer shall post and maintain in places readily accessi-
32 ble to individuals performing services for him printed statements concern-
33 ing benefit rights under this chapter which shall be provided by the depart-
34 ment without cost to the employer.
35 (3)(a) Following the filing of a claim pursuant to subsection (1) of
36 this section the department shall:
37 (i) Verify the claimant's monetary eligibility pursuant to the
38 requirements of section 72-1367, Idaho Code, and issue a determi-
39 nation. If monetarily eligible, the department shall establish
40 the date the claimant's benefit year begins, the weekly benefit
41 amount, the total benefit amount, the base period wages, and the
42 base period covered employers.
43 (ii) If a claimant is monetarily eligible, the department shall
44 verify, based on information provided by the claimant, whether the
45 week claimed is a compensable week as defined in section 72-1312,
46 Idaho Code. To receive benefits, a claimant must certify that each
47 week claimed is a compensable week. In the event the week claimed
48 is not a compensable week, the department shall issue a determina-
66
1 tion denying benefits and shall include the reasons for the ineli-
2 gibility.
3 (b) If the department has reason to believe at any time within five
4 (5) years from the week ending date for any week in which benefits were
5 paid that a claimant was not eligible for benefits, the department may
6 investigate the claim and on the basis of facts found issue a determina-
7 tion denying or allowing benefits for the week(s) in question. If the
8 department determines a claimant was not entitled to benefits received,
9 the department shall issue a determination requiring repayment of the
10 overpaid benefits, and assess any applicable penalties and interest.
11 The determination shall contain provisions advising of the right to
12 appeal the decision to the department within fourteen (14) days of the
13 date of service.
14 (c) Before a determination provided for in subsection (3) of this sec-
15 tion becomes final or an appeal is filed, the department, on its own
16 motion, may issue a revised determination. The determination or re-
17 vised determination shall become final unless, within fourteen (14)
18 days after notice, as provided in subsection (5) of this section, an
19 appeal is filed by an interested party with the department. The appeal
20 notice must be in writing, signed by an interested party, the appellant
21 or representative, and contain words that, by fair interpretation, re-
22 quest the appeal process for a specific determination or other decision
23 of the department. If an appeal is delivered personally, the personal
24 delivery date will be noted on the appeal and deemed the date of filing.
25 A faxed or electronically transmitted appeal shall be deemed filed on
26 the date received by the department, mountain time, or, if received on a
27 weekend or holiday, the next business day. If mailed, the appeal shall
28 be deemed filed on the date of mailing as determined by the postmark on
29 the envelope containing the appeal. Where it appears any appeal to the
30 appeals examiner, claim, or any other request or application was not
31 filed within the time period prescribed for filing, it shall be dis-
32 missed on such grounds.
33 (d) If a party establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that, be-
34 cause of delay or error by the United States postal service or because
35 of error on the part of the department, a determination was not deliv-
36 ered to the party's last known address, or transmitted electronically
37 in a manner approved by the department, within fourteen (14) days of the
38 date of mailing or service indicated on the determination, the period
39 for filing a timely appeal extends to fourteen (14) days from the date of
40 actual notice.
41 (4)(a) Upon appeal of a determination or revised determination, the di-
42 rector shall transfer the appeal directly to an appeals examiner pur-
43 suant to subsection (6) of this section, unless the director finds, in
44 his sole discretion, that a redetermination should be issued affirming,
45 reversing or modifying the determination or revised determination. The
46 redetermination shall become final unless, within fourteen (14) days
47 after notice as provided in subsection (5) of this section, an appeal is
48 filed by an interested party with the department in accordance with the
49 department's rules.
67
1 (b) The director may, in his sole discretion, make a special redeter-
2 mination whenever he finds that a departmental error has occurred in
3 connection with a determination, revised determination or redetermi-
4 nation that has become final, or that additional wages of the claimant
5 or other facts pertinent to such final determination, revised deter-
6 mination or redetermination have become available or have been newly
7 discovered, or that benefits have been allowed or denied or the amount
8 of benefits fixed on the basis of nondisclosure or misrepresentation of
9 fact. The special redetermination must be made within one (1) year from
10 the date the determination, revised determination or redetermination
11 became final, except that a special redetermination involving a find-
12 ing that benefits have been allowed or denied or the amount of benefits
13 fixed on the basis of nondisclosures or misrepresentations of fact may
14 be made within two (2) years from the date the determination, revised
15 determination or redetermination became final.
16 (5) All interested parties shall be entitled to prompt service of no-
17 tice of written or digital communications from the department providing
18 notice of an administrative or other deadline including, but not limited
19 to, determinations, revised determinations, redeterminations, special
20 redeterminations, decisions and letters from the department requiring a
21 response within a specified time. Notice shall be deemed served if deliv-
22 ered to the person being served, if mailed to his last known address or if
23 electronically transmitted to him at his request and with the department's
24 approval. Service by mail shall be deemed complete on the date of mailing.
25 Service by electronic transmission shall be deemed complete on the date no-
26 tice is electronically transmitted.
27 (6) To hear and decide appeals from determinations, revised determina-
28 tions, redeterminations, and special redeterminations, the director shall
29 appoint appeals examiners. Unless the appeal is withdrawn, the appeals ex-
30 aminer shall affirm, modify, set aside or reverse the determination, revised
31 determination, redetermination, or special redetermination involved, after
32 affording the interested parties reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing,
33 or may refer a matter back to the department for further action. The appeals
34 examiner shall notify the interested parties of his decision by serving no-
35 tice in the same manner as provided in subsection (5) of this section. The
36 decision shall set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law and contain
37 provisions advising of the right to appeal the decision within fourteen (14)
38 days of the date of service. The appeals examiner may, either upon applica-
39 tion for rehearing by an interested party or on his own motion, rehear, af-
40 firm, modify, set aside or reverse any prior decision on the basis of the evi-
41 dence previously submitted or on the basis of additional evidence; provided,
42 that such application or motion be made within ten (10) days after the date of
43 service of the decision. A complete record shall be kept of all proceedings
44 in connection with an appealed claim. All testimony at any hearing shall be
45 recorded. If a claim for review of the appeals examiner's decision is filed
46 with the commission, the testimony shall be transcribed if ordered by the
47 commission. Witnesses subpoenaed by the appeals examiner shall be allowed
48 fees at a rate prescribed by the director. If any interested party to a hear-
49 ing formally requests the appeals examiner to issue a subpoena for a witness
50 whose evidence is deemed necessary, the appeals examiner shall promptly is-
68
1 sue the subpoena, unless such request is determined to be unreasonable. Un-
2 less an interested party shall within fourteen (14) days after service of the
3 decision of the appeals examiner file with the commission a claim for review
4 or unless an application or motion is made for a rehearing of such decision,
5 the decision of the appeals examiner shall become final.
6 (7) The commission shall decide all claims for review filed by any in-
7 terested party in accordance with its own rules of procedure not in conflict
8 herewith. The record before the commission shall consist of the record of
9 proceedings before the appeals examiner, unless it appears to the commission
10 that the interests of justice require that the interested parties be permit-
11 ted to present additional evidence. In that event, the commission may, in
12 its sole discretion, conduct a hearing or may remand the matter back to the
13 appeals examiner for an additional hearing and decision. On the basis of the
14 record of proceedings before the appeals examiner as well as additional ev-
15 idence, if allowed, the commission shall affirm, reverse, modify, set aside
16 or revise the decision of the appeals examiner or may refer the matter back to
17 the appeals examiner for further proceedings. The commission shall file its
18 decision and shall promptly serve notice of its decision to all interested
19 parties. A decision of the commission shall be final and conclusive as to all
20 matters adjudicated by the commission upon filing the decision in the office
21 of the commission; provided, within twenty (20) days from the date of filing
22 the decision, any party may move for reconsideration of the decision or the
23 commission may rehear or reconsider its decision on its own initiative. The
24 decision shall be final upon denial of a motion for rehearing or reconsidera-
25 tion or the filing of the decision on reconsideration.
26 (8) No person acting on behalf of the director or any member of the com-
27 mission shall participate in any case in which he has a direct or indirect
28 personal interest.
29 (9) An appeal may be made to the Supreme Court from decisions and orders
30 of the commission within the times and in the manner prescribed by rule of the
31 Supreme Court.
32 (10)(a) Benefits shall be paid promptly in accordance with any decision
33 allowing benefits, regardless of:
34 (i) The pendency of a time period for filing an appeal or peti-
35 tioning for commission review; or
36 (ii) The pendency of an appeal or petition for review.
37 (b) Such payments shall not be withheld until a subsequent appeals ex-
38 aminer decision or commission decision modifies or reverses the previ-
39 ous decision, in which event benefits shall be paid or denied in accor-
40 dance with such decision.
41 (11)(a) Any right, fact, or matter in issue, directly based upon or nec-
42 essarily involved in a determination, redetermination, decision of the
43 appeals examiner or decision of the commission which has become final,
44 shall be conclusive for all the purposes of this chapter as between the
45 interested parties who had notice of such determination, redetermina-
46 tion or decision. Subject to appeal proceedings and judicial review by
47 the Supreme Court as set forth in this section, any determination, rede-
48 termination or decision as to rights to benefits shall be conclusive for
49 all purposes of this chapter and shall not be subject to collateral at-
50 tack irrespective of notice.
69
1 (b) No finding of fact or conclusion of law contained in a decision or
2 determination rendered pursuant to this chapter by an appeals examiner,
3 the industrial commission, a court, or any other person authorized to
4 make such determinations shall have preclusive effect in any other ac-
5 tion or proceeding, except proceedings that are brought (i) pursuant
6 to this chapter, (ii) to collect unemployment insurance contributions,
7 (iii) to recover overpayments of unemployment insurance benefits, or
8 (iv) to challenge the constitutionality of provisions of this chapter
9 or administrative proceedings under this chapter.
10 (12) The provisions of the Idaho administrative procedure act, chapter
11 52, title 67, Idaho Code, regarding contested cases and judicial review of
12 contested cases are inapplicable to proceedings involving claimants under
13 the provisions of this chapter.

17 lowing persons, in violation of the provisions of chapter 1, title 74,
18 Idaho Code, or section 72-1342, Idaho Code, or rules or department policies
19 promulgated thereunder, or the material terms of any confidentiality and

21 security information, each act of unauthorized disclosure shall constitute
22 a separate misdemeanor:
23 (1) Any employee of the department;

26 curity information pertaining to a person with the written, informed consent

37 the event the director determines that it is necessary to obtain advances
38 from the federal unemployment account in the unemployment trust fund pur-
39 suant to title XII of the social security act (42 U.S.C. 1321), and that a
40 request for such advances is authorized under section 1201 of the social se-
41 curity act, or under any other act of congress extending such authority, the
42 director shall request the governor to make application to the secretary of
43 labor of the United States for such advances.
44 (2) The governor is authorized to make application to the secretary of
45 labor of the United States to obtain advances pursuant to title XII of the
46 social security act (42 U.S.C. 1321 et seq.). Funds so advanced shall be for
47 the payment of unemployment insurance benefits.
70
1 (3) Any amount transferred to the employment security fund by the sec-
2 retary of the treasury of the United States in accordance with this section
3 shall be repaid from the employment security fund as provided in section 1202
4 of the social security act (42 U.S.C. 1322).
5 (4) There is established in the state treasury the "Federal Advance In-
6 terest Repayment Fund." This fund shall consist of all moneys collected pur-
7 suant to subsection (5) of this section and interest earned upon any moneys
8 in the fund. All moneys in the fund are perpetually appropriated to the di-
9 rector for the payment of interest on any advance made to this state pursuant
10 to title XII of the social security act, except that if, at the end of any cal-
11 endar year, all advances and interest have been repaid, any remaining bal-

25 under subsections (1) and (2) of this section;
26 (ii) Estimate the amount of federal advance interest repayment
27 tax receipts expected to be collected during the quarter for any
28 preceding calendar quarter in which such tax was assessed;
29 (iii) Add the amount in the federal advance interest repayment
30 fund on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter
31 to the estimate in paragraph (ii) of this subsection; and
32 (iv) Subtract the sum obtained in paragraph (iii) from the esti-
33 mate in paragraph (i) of this subsection.

35 of this section is more than zero, each covered employer subject to this
36 section may, at the director's sole discretion, be assessed a federal
37 advance interest repayment tax. Such tax shall be a percentage of the
38 contributions payable under sections 72-1349 and 72-1350, Idaho Code,
39 for the calendar quarter, but in no case shall be less than one dollar
40 ($1.00). The percentage shall be determined by dividing the remainder
41 in paragraph (iv) of subsection (5)(a) of this section by the estimated
42 amount of contributions due and payable on wages paid during the quar-
43 ter. The percentage shall be rounded up to the next one-tenth of a per-
44 cent (0.1%).
45 (c) The tax assessed shall be collected and paid in accordance with such
46 rules as the director may prescribe. All such taxes collected shall be
47 deposited in the federal advance interest repayment fund. Any such tax
48 imposed in a calendar quarter shall be paid on or before the last day of
49 the second month following the close of such calendar quarter. An ex-
71
1 tension of time for payment may be granted for good cause in accordance
2 with section 72-1349(4)(6), Idaho Code.
3 (d) If any covered employer fails to pay such tax on or before the date
4 on which they are due, such tax shall bear penalty at a rate of five dol-
5 lars ($5.00) for each month or fraction thereof until paid; provided,
6 that in no case shall the penalty exceed the actual amount of the tax
7 due and payable. The date of payment shall be deemed the date of ac-
8 tual receipt by the director, or if mailed, the date of mailing. Penal-
9 ties collected pursuant to this subsection shall be paid into the fed-
10 eral advance interest payment fund. Furthermore, if any employer be-
11 comes delinquent in making payment of the tax as required by this sub-
12 section, such employer shall be subject to the collection provisions in
13 sections 72-1355 and 72-1360, Idaho Code.
14 (e) A covered employer may make application to the director for a re-
15 fund or credit of any amount erroneously paid as tax under this subsec-
16 tion. Such applications and the director's determinations regarding
17 them shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 72-1357,
18 Idaho Code.

45 ceding consecutive calendar quarters; or
46 (ii) One hundred fifty dollars ($150) or fifty percent (50%) of
47 the amount that would be due if the employer had filed a timely

12 to report a material fact when submitting facts to the department
13 concerning a claimant's separation from the employer, a penalty in
14 an amount equal to ten (10) times the weekly benefit amount of such
15 claimant shall be added to the liability of the employer.
16 (d) If a determination is made finding that an employer has induced, so-
17 licited, coerced or colluded with an employee or former employee to file
18 a false or fraudulent claim for benefits under this chapter, a penalty
19 in an amount equal to ten (10) times the weekly benefit amount of such
20 employee or former employee shall be added to the liability of the em-
21 ployer.
22 (e) If a determination is made finding that an employer failed to com-
23 plete and submit an Idaho business registration form when due, as re-
24 quired by section 72-1337(1), Idaho Code, a penalty of five hundred dol-
25 lars ($500) shall be assessed against the employer.
26 (f) For purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this subsection, the term
27 "weekly benefit amount" means the amount determined by the director
28 pursuant to section 72-1367(2), Idaho Code.
29 (g) If a determination is made finding that a person has made any unau-
30 thorized disclosure of employment security information in violation of
31 the provisions of chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, or section 72-1342,
32 Idaho Code, or rules promulgated thereunder, a penalty of five hundred
33 dollars ($500) for each act of unauthorized disclosure shall be as-
34 sessed against the person.
35 (h) If a determination is made finding that a professional employer
36 failed to submit a separate quarterly wage report for each client as re-
37 quired in section 72-1349B(4)(9), Idaho Code, the director shall assess
38 a monetary penalty equal to one hundred dollars ($100) for each client
39 not separately reported by the professional employer; provided that the
40 maximum penalty for any quarter shall not exceed five thousand dollars
41 ($5,000).
42 (2) At the discretion of the director, the department may waive all or
43 any part of the penalties imposed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section
44 if the employer shows to the satisfaction of the director that it had good
45 cause for failing to comply with the requirements of this chapter and rules
46 promulgated thereunder.
47 (3) Determinations imposing civil penalties pursuant to this section
48 shall be served in accordance with section 72-1368(5), Idaho Code. Penal-
49 ties imposed pursuant to this section shall be due and payable twenty (20)
50 days after the date the determination was served unless an appeal is filed
73

2 under. Such appeals shall be conducted in accordance with section 72-1368,
3 Idaho Code, and rules promulgated thereunder.
4 (4) Civil penalties imposed by this section shall be in addition to any
5 other penalties authorized by this chapter. The provisions of this chap-
6 ter that apply to the collection of contributions, and the rules promulgated
7 thereunder, shall also apply to the collection of penalties imposed pursuant
8 to this section. Amounts collected pursuant to this section shall be paid
9 into the state employment security administrative and reimbursement fund as
10 established by section 72-1348, Idaho Code.

23 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
24 SECTION 1. That Section 45-617, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
25 amended to read as follows:
26 45-617. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS FOR WAGE CLAIMS. (1) Wage claims
27 filed with the department, excluding potential penalties, are limited by the
28 same dollar amount that limits actions before the small claims department of
29 the magistrate division of the district court.
30 (2) The contested case provisions of the Idaho administrative proce-
31 dure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, are inapplicable to proceedings
32 involving wage claims under this chapter.
33 (3) Once a wage claim has been properly filed with the department, the
34 provisions of this section shall provide the exclusive remedy for resolving
35 the wage claim. If at any time after the filing of the wage claim the depart-
36 ment determines that it lacks jurisdiction over the wage claim, the depart-
37 ment shall provide written notification of its determination to the claimant
38 and the employer. The claimant may then assert the wage claim in any court
39 of competent jurisdiction. In the event the department determines that it
40 lacks jurisdiction over the wage claim, the limitation periods provided for
41 in section 45-614, Idaho Code, shall be tolled from the date the wage claim
42 was filed with the department until the date notice that the department lacks
43 jurisdiction is mailed to the claimant, as provided in subsection (5) (8) of
44 this section.
45 (4) A department compliance officer shall examine wage claims filed
46 with the department and, on the basis of the facts found, shall determine
47 whether the wage claimant is entitled to an award for unpaid wages and penal-
48 ties. If the compliance officer is unable to determine whether wages and

3
1 penalties are owed, the claim may be referred to a hearing officer for a
2 determination. The department may adjust the amount of penalties awarded
3 for an employer's failure to comply with the requirements of section 45-606,
4 Idaho Code. The department may award no penalty or may award a penalty in any
5 amount up to the maximum amount allowed under section 45-607, Idaho Code. No
6 penalty shall be awarded by the department unless a specific finding is made
7 that wages were withheld willfully, arbitrarily and without just cause. The
8 department's determination shall include findings of fact and conclusions
9 of law. Before the determination becomes final or an appeal is filed, the
10 compliance or hearing officer that issued the determination may, on his own
11 motion, issue a revised determination. The determination or revised deter-
12 mination shall become a final determination unless, within fourteen (14)
13 days after notice, as provided in subsection (5) of this section, an appeal
14 is filed by the claimant or the employer in accordance with the department's
15 rules. If an appeal is not timely filed, the amount awarded by a final deter-
16 mination shall become immediately due and payable to the department. A final
17 determination may be enforced by the department in accordance with section
18 45-618, Idaho Code.
19 (5) The claimant and the employer shall be entitled to prompt service
20 of notice of determinations and decisions. Notice shall be deemed served if
21 delivered to the person being served, if mailed to the person's last known
22 address, or if electronically transmitted to the claimant at the claimant's
23 request and with the department's approval. Service by electronic transmis-
24 sion shall be deemed complete on the date notice is electronically transmit-
25 ted. The date indicated on determinations or decisions as the "date of ser-
26 vice" or "date of mailing" shall be presumed to be the date of service unless
27 otherwise shown by a preponderance of competent evidence.
28 (5) The department may dismiss wage claims without prejudice when a
29 claimant fails to respond within thirty (30) days to written notice from
30 the department that additional action is required on the claimant's part to
31 prosecute the claim. The thirty (30) day period for a response begins the
32 date the notice is mailed to the wage claimant's last known address. Mailed
33 responses from claimants are deemed received the date they are postmarked.
34 A wage claim dismissed for lack of prosecution may be refiled with the de-
35 partment subject to the limitation periods provided in section 45-614, Idaho
36 Code.
37 (6) The determinations and revised determinations shall include find-
38 ings of fact and conclusions of law and contain provisions advising the
39 claimant and employer of their rights to appeal the determination within
40 fourteen (14) days from the date of mailing or the date of electronic trans-
41 mission in a manner approved by the department.
42 (7) The timely filing of an appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional. The
43 determination or revised determination shall become a final determination
44 unless an appeal is filed by the claimant or the employer in accordance with
45 this chapter and the department's rules within fourteen (14) days after no-
46 tice provided pursuant to subsection (8) of this section. Provided, how-
47 ever, if a party establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that, because
48 of delay or error by the United States postal service or because of error on
49 the part of the department, a determination or revised determination was not
50 delivered to the party's last known address or transmitted electronically in

4
1 a manner approved by the department within fourteen (14) days of the date of
2 mailing or service indicated on the determination or revised determination,
3 the period for filing a timely appeal to the department or the commission ex-
4 tends to fourteen (14) days from the date of receipt of notice. If an appeal
5 is not timely filed, the amount awarded by a determination or revised deter-
6 mination shall become immediately due and payable to the department and may
7 be enforced by the department in accordance with section 45-618, Idaho Code.
8 (8) The claimant and the employer shall be entitled to prompt service
9 of notice of determinations and revised determinations. Notice shall be
10 deemed served if delivered to the person being served, if mailed to the per-
11 son's last known address, or if electronically transmitted to the claimant
12 at the claimant's request and with the department's approval. Service by
13 electronic transmission shall be deemed complete on the date notice is elec-
14 tronically transmitted. The date indicated on determinations or revised
15 determinations as the date of service or date of mailing shall be presumed to
16 be the date of service unless otherwise shown by a preponderance of competent
17 evidence.
18 (6) (9) An appeal from a wage claim determination or revised determina-
19 tion shall be in writing, signed by the appellant or the appellant's repre-
20 sentative and shall contain words that, by fair interpretation, request the
21 appeal process for a specific determination of the department. The appeal
22 may be filed by personal delivery, by mail, by electronic transmission, or by
23 fax to the wage and hour section of the department at the address indicated on
24 the wage claim determination. The date of personal delivery shall be noted
25 on the appeal and shall be deemed the date of filing. If mailed, the appeal
26 shall be deemed to be filed on the date of mailing as determined by the post-
27 mark. A faxed or electronically transmitted appeal shall be deemed filed on
28 the date received by the wage and hour section. A faxed or electronically
29 transmitted appeal received by the wage and hour section on a weekend or hol-
30 iday shall be deemed filed on the next business day.
31 (7) (10) To hear and decide appeals from determinations, the director
32 shall appoint appeals examiners who have been specifically trained to hear
33 wage claims. Unless the appeal is withdrawn, the appeals examiner shall af-
34 firm, modify, set aside or reverse the determination involved, after afford-
35 ing the claimant and the employer reasonable opportunity for a fair hear-
36 ing, or may refer a matter back to the compliance or hearing officer for fur-
37 ther action. The appeals examiner shall notify the claimant and the employer
38 of his decision by serving notice in the same manner as provided in subsec-
39 tion (5) (8) of this section. The decision shall set forth findings of fact
40 and conclusions of law. The appeals examiner may, upon application for re-
41 hearing by the claimant, the employer, or on his own motion, rehear, affirm,
42 modify, set aside or reverse any prior decision on the basis of the evidence
43 previously submitted or on the basis of additional evidence; provided, that
44 such application or motion be made within ten (10) days after the date of
45 service of the decision. A complete record shall be kept of all proceed-
46 ings in connection with an appealed wage claim. All testimony at any hear-
47 ing shall be recorded. Witnesses subpoenaed by the appeals examiner shall be
48 allowed fees at a rate prescribed by the director. If the claimant or the em-
49 ployer formally requests the appeals examiner to issue a subpoena for a wit-
50 ness whose evidence is deemed necessary, the appeals examiner shall promptly

5
1 issue the subpoena, unless such request is determined to be unreasonable.
2 Unless the claimant or the employer, within fourteen (14) days after service
3 of the decision of the appeals examiner, seeks judicial review pursuant to
4 section 45-619, Idaho Code, or unless an application or motion is made for a
5 rehearing of such decision, the decision of the appeals examiner shall be-
6 come final and the amount awarded by the decision shall become immediately
7 due and payable to the department. A decision that has become final may be
8 enforced by the department according to section 45-618, Idaho Code.
9 (8) (11) No person acting on behalf of the director shall participate in
10 any case in which he has a direct or indirect personal interest.
11 (9) (12)(a) Any right, fact, or matter in issue, directly based upon or
12 necessarily involved in a determination or decision of the appeals ex-
13 aminer that has become final, shall be conclusive for all the purposes
14 of this chapter as between the claimant and the employer who had notice
15 of such determination or decision. Subject to judicial review as set
16 forth in this chapter, any determination or decision shall be conclu-
17 sive for all purposes of this chapter and shall not be subject to collat-
18 eral attack irrespective of notice.
19 (b) No finding of fact or conclusion of law contained in a determination
20 or decision rendered pursuant to this chapter by an appeals examiner, a
21 court, or any other person authorized to make such determinations shall
22 have preclusive effect in any other action or proceeding, except pro-
23 ceedings that are brought:
24 (i) Pursuant to this chapter;
25 (ii) To collect wage claims; or
26 (iii) To challenge the constitutionality of provisions of this
27 chapter or administrative proceedings under this chapter.
28 SECTION 2. That Chapter 13, Title 72, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
29 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
30 ignated as Section 72-1303A, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
31 72-1303A. ABLE TO WORK -- AVAILABLE FOR SUITABLE WORK. (1) "Able to
32 work" means having the physical and mental ability to perform work for which
33 a claimant is qualified under conditions ordinarily existing during a normal
34 workweek. It does not mean that a person must be able to perform work in his
35 customary occupation or the same kind of work he last performed. A person
36 who is able to work only part of the workday or part of the workweek is not
37 considered able to work.
38 (2) An individual with a disability under the Americans with disabili-
39 ties act, 42 U.S.C. 12112, as defined by 29 CFR 1630.2(g), whose disability
40 prevents the claimant from working full time or during particular shifts is
41 not deemed unable to work or unavailable for work for as long as the claimant
42 demonstrates he is able to perform some work and remains available for work
43 to the full extent of his ability. A qualified claimant with a disability who
44 is able to work with or without a reasonable accommodation will be considered
45 as having complied with the requirement of being available for work when the
46 claimant is willing to work the maximum number of hours the claimant is able
47 to work. Qualified claimants with disabilities must meet all other eligi-
48 bility requirements, including the illness provisions of this section.

6
1 (3)(a) A claimant who withdraws from the labor market because of ill-
2 ness or injury prior to filing a claim is not eligible for unemployment
3 benefits until he is able and available for work; provided, no claimant
4 shall be considered ineligible with respect to any week of unemployment
5 for failure to comply with this section if the failure is due to an ill-
6 ness or disability that commences after applying for unemployment bene-
7 fits and no work that would have been suitable prior to the beginning of
8 the illness or injury has been offered the claimant.
9 (b) A person who claims benefits under this illness provision must re-
10 main available for job referral by the department; however, he may leave
11 the area for treatment of his illness and continue to be eligible under
12 the provisions of this section.
13 (4) "Available for suitable work" means remaining within and actively
14 seeking suitable work in a locality in which the individual has earned wages
15 subject to the provisions of this chapter during the individual's base pe-
16 riod or, if the individual moves his permanent residence outside of that lo-
17 cality, then in a locality where suitable work normally is performed. Being
18 available for suitable work encompasses a readiness, ability, and willing-
19 ness to work and to find a job, including the possibility of marketing the
20 claimant's services in the claimant's area of availability. The type of work
21 for which the claimant is available must exist in the claimant's area to the
22 extent that a normal unemployed person would generally find work within a
23 reasonable period of time.
24 (5) For the purposes of this section, "workweek" means:
25 (a) For an employer-attached or union-attached classification, the
26 claimant's normal workweek as defined by the employer or union;
27 (b) For a work-seeking classification, Monday through Friday, 8:00
28 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.; or
29 (c) For an approved training classification, regular class hours.
30 (6) Claimant work availability requirements are waived on Independence
31 Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day.
32 (7) A claimant seeking work must be willing to travel the distance nor-
33 mally traveled by other workers in his area and occupation.
34 (8) An individual who restricts availability to part-time work pur-
35 suant to section 72-1366(4)(d), Idaho Code, is considered fully employed and
36 ineligible to receive benefits if the individual works hours comparable to
37 the part-time work experience in the individual's base period. A claimant
38 must be available for a full workweek and a full, normal workday unless the
39 claimant establishes that the majority of weeks worked during the claimant's
40 base period were for less than full-time work, which is established where the
41 total base period wages divided by the claimant's last regular rate of pay
42 does not exceed two thousand seventy-nine (2,079) hours.
43 (9) A claimant who is incarcerated for any part of the workweek is not
44 eligible for benefits for that week, unless the claimant can establish he has

46 meet his work search requirements and obtain full-time employment.
47 (10) A claimant who moves to a remote locality where there is little pos-
48 sibility of obtaining suitable work is not eligible for benefits.
49 (11) A public official who receives pay and performs full-time service

7
1 even though receiving pay, may be considered available for work the same as
2 any other individual employed on a part-time basis.

17 ployer, must meet the same standard of remaining within their local labor
18 market area during the workweek in order to be considered available for work,
19 unless the primary purpose of a temporary absence is to seek work in another
20 labor market. Claimants otherwise eligible to receive benefits while par-
21 ticipating in an approved training program or course are not deemed ineli-
22 gible when the training or course occurs outside of their local labor market
23 due to the unavailability of similar programs or courses within their local

35 than those prevailing for similar work in the local area.

37 availability for work by insisting on a wage rate that is higher than the pre-
38 vailing wage for similar work in that area.
39 (21) The claimant's prior earnings and past experience are considered
40 in determining whether work is suitable.
41 (22) For the purpose of approving a waiver of the two (2) year limitation
42 on school or training courses specified by section 72-1366(8)(c)(ii), Idaho
43 Code, for claimants who lack skills to compete in the labor market, the fol-
44 lowing criteria must be met:

46 pleting the school or training course after his benefits have been ex-
47 hausted;
48 (b) The claimant must establish there is a demand for the occupation in
49 which the claimant will be trained. An occupation is considered in de-

8
1 mand when work opportunities are available and there is not a surplus of
2 qualified applicants; and
3 (c) At the time that the claimant applies for the waiver, the usual du-
4 ration of the school or training course is no longer than two (2) years.

12 teria are met:
13 (a) Substantially all the remuneration, whether or not received in

16 the number of hours worked; and
17 (b) The services performed by the individual are performed pursuant to
18 a written contract between the individual and the person for whom the
19 services are performed, and the contract provides that the individual
20 shall not be treated as an employee for federal and state tax purposes.
21 Such exemption applies solely to the individual's engagement in the trade or
22 business of selling or soliciting the sale of consumer products in a private
23 home or location other than in a permanent retail establishment.

29 SECTION 11. That Chapter 13, Title 72, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
30 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
31 ignated as Section 72-1316B, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
32 72-1316B. FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT. Full-time employment exists where a
33 claimant works what are customarily considered full-time hours for a week
34 for that industry or where the earnings are more than one and one-half (1 1/2)
35 times the claimant's weekly benefit amount.

40 of this section and who has filed all payroll reports required, has paid,
41 on or before the cutoff date, all contributions and penalties due, and has
42 established a record of accumulated contributions in excess of benefits
43 charged to his account. For the purposes of this section, delinquencies
44 of a minor nature may be disregarded if the director is satisfied that such
45 covered employer has acted in good faith and that forfeiture of a reduced
46 taxable wage rate because of such minor delinquency would be inequitable.

17
1 (2) "Qualifying period" shall be the period of three (3) consecutive
2 years ending on the computation date in which, during all of said years, the
3 employer shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter, except that a
4 new employer shall have a qualifying period of one (1) year ending on the com-
5 putation date in which, during all of said year, the employer shall be sub-
6 ject to the requirements of this chapter.
7 (3) Any employer who ceases to have covered employment for a period of
8 six (6) consecutive quarters or more shall complete another qualifying pe-
9 riod to be eligible for consideration for a reduced contribution rate.
10 SECTION 13. That Chapter 13, Title 72, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
11 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
12 ignated as Section 72-1326, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:

24 earned;
25 (d) Holiday pay reportable as though earned in the week in which the

31 lump sum payment at the time of severance of the employment relationship
32 must be reported when paid;
33 (g) Vacation pay allocable to a certain period of time in accordance
34 with an employment agreement reportable in the week to which it is allo-
35 cable. Vacation pay received in a lump sum payment at the time of sever-

43 as earnings in equal portions in each week of the period covered by the
44 contract;
45 (j) Remuneration received for relief work or public service work;
46 (k) Temporary disability benefits under a worker's compensation law of
47 any state or under a similar law of the United States, reported in an

2 annuity, or other similar periodic payment is made under a plan main-
3 tained or contributed to by a base period employer. The dollar amount of
4 the weekly pension will be deducted from the claimant's weekly benefit
5 amount unless the claimant has made contributions toward the pension.
6 If the claimant has made contributions toward the pension plan, no
7 deduction for the pension will be made from the claimant's weekly ben-
8 efit amount. The burden shall be on the claimant to establish that he
9 has made contributions toward the pension, retirement pay, annuity or
10 other similar payment plan. Any change in the amount of the pension,
11 retirement, or annuity payments that affects the deduction from the
12 claimant's weekly benefit amount will be applied in the first full week

39 hire. Any wages so determined by the department shall be reported to the em-
40 ployer.
41 SECTION 16. That Chapter 13, Title 72, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
42 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
43 ignated as Section 72-1328A, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
44 72-1328A. BOARD, LODGING, AND MEALS. (1) When board, lodging, meals,
45 or any other payment-in-kind comprise, in whole or in part, an employee's
46 wages, the value of such board, lodging, or other payment shall be determined
47 as follows:
48 (a) If a cash value is agreed upon in any contract of hire, the amount
49 so agreed upon shall be used if it is a reasonable fair market value. If

21
1 there is no agreement or if the contract of hire states an amount less
2 than a reasonable fair market value, the department shall determine the
3 reasonable fair market value to be used.
4 (b) The value of meals and lodging furnished by an employer to the
5 employee shall not be included in the employee's gross income when
6 furnished on the employer's business premises for the employer's con-
7 venience and, in the case of lodging but not meals, the employees are
8 required to accept the lodging in order to properly perform their duties
9 and as a condition of their employment.
10 (c) In order to exclude the value of lodging from an employee's gross
11 wages, the employer must show that the wages paid to the employee for
12 services performed meet the prevailing wage for those services. If the
13 employer's records do not show or establish that the employee received
14 the prevailing wage for services performed, then the reasonable fair
15 market value of the lodging shall be included as wages in the employee's
16 gross income.
17 (2) Meals or lodging furnished shall be considered for the employer's
18 convenience if the employer has a substantial business reason other than
19 providing additional remuneration to the employee. A statement that the
20 meals or lodging are not intended as remuneration is not sufficient to
21 establish that either meals or lodging are furnished for the employer's con-
22 venience.
23 (3) In the case of employees who receive remuneration in the form of
24 subsistence, such as groceries, staples, and fundamental shelter, the rea-
25 sonable fair market value of such subsistence shall be determined by the de-
26 partment.
27 SECTION 17. That Chapter 13, Title 72, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
28 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
29 ignated as Section 72-1330A, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
30 72-1330A. WORKPLACE MISCONDUCT. (1) "Workplace misconduct" means
31 conduct in connection with employment that willfully disregards the em-
32 ployer's interest, willfully violates the employer's reasonable rules, or
33 disregards a standard of behavior that the employer has a right to expect of
34 its employees.
35 (2) A claimant's conduct disregards a standard of behavior the employer
36 has a right to expect of its employees when the conduct falls below the stan-
37 dard of behavior expected by the employer and the employer's expectation was
38 objectively reasonable. There is no requirement that the claimant's conduct
39 be willful, intentional, or deliberate. The claimant's subjective state of
40 mind is not a relevant factor in determining workplace misconduct pursuant
41 to this subsection.
42 (3) An employer's expectation shall be considered objectively reason-
43 able when it is communicated to the employee or flows naturally from the em-
44 ployment relationship. An expectation that flows naturally need not be com-
45 municated to an employee to be considered objectively reasonable.
46 (4) Mere inefficiency, unsatisfactory conduct, inadvertencies, iso-
47 lated instances of ordinary negligence, good faith errors in judgment or
48 discretion, or failure to meet the performance expectations of the employer

22
1 because of inability or incapacity shall not be considered misconduct con-
2 nected with employment.
3 (5) Except as provided in section 72-1366(5), Idaho Code, conduct in-
4 volving personal, nonjob-related behavior occurring outside the workplace
5 shall not be considered workplace misconduct in connection with employment.
6 SECTION 18. That Section 72-1337, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
7 amended to read as follows:
8 72-1337. RECORDS AND REPORTS. (1) Each employer that is a "covered em-
9 ployer," as defined in section 72-1315, Idaho Code, shall complete and sub-
10 mit to the director an Idaho business registration form within six (6) months
11 of becoming a covered employer.
12 (2) Each employer, including those who are not covered employers, shall
13 keep accurate records, for such periods of time and containing such infor-
14 mation as the director may prescribe. Such records for a period of five (5)
15 years, including, without limitation:
16 (a) The full name and home address of the worker;
17 (b) The social security number of the worker;
18 (c) The place of work within the state;
19 (d) The date on which the worker was hired, rehired, or returned to work
20 after a temporary or partial layoff;
21 (e) The date on which the worker's employment was terminated;
22 (f) Whether the termination occurred by reason of:
23 (i) The worker's death;
24 (ii) The voluntary action by the worker and the reason given by the
25 worker; or
26 (iii) Discharge by the employer and the reason for the discharge;
27 (g) Wages paid for employment in each pay period and total wages for
28 all pay periods ending each quarter for the year, showing separately:
29 money wages, the cash value of other remuneration, and the amount of all
30 bonuses or commissions; and

32 and employee business expenses and the amounts of such expenditures ac-
33 tually incurred and accounted for.
34 (3) Employers that are liable to pay tax contributions, or that have
35 elected a cost reimbursement option in lieu of tax contributions, shall sub-
36 mit quarterly contribution reports in the form or medium designated by the
37 department.
38 (4)(a) Each contribution shall be accompanied by an employer's contri-
39 bution report. All contribution reports shall be filed electronically
40 with the department unless the employer has petitioned the department
41 in writing for a waiver and the department has granted a waiver allow-
42 ing the filing of a non-electronic contribution report. All contribu-
43 tion reports shall be in a form or medium prescribed and furnished or ap-
44 proved for such purpose by the department, giving such information as
45 may be required, including the number of individuals employed and wages
46 paid or payable to each. Every report must be signed, furnished, or ac-
47 knowledged by the covered employer or on the employer's behalf by a per-
48 son who has personal knowledge of the facts stated therein and who has
49 been authorized by the covered employer to submit the information.

23
1 (b) Each employer shall report all wages paid for services in covered
2 employment each calendar quarter. In the event a covered employer does
3 not pay wages during a calendar quarter, the employer shall file a quar-
4 terly report indicating that no wages were paid.
5 (c) The total wages and taxable wages shown on the contribution report
6 to be used in computing contributions due shall be reduced to the next
7 lower full dollar amount.
8 (d) An employer shall be covered for all four (4) quarters in the calen-
9 dar year in which the employer becomes a covered employer as well as for
10 all four (4) quarters in the succeeding calendar year. Employers are
11 not required to file quarterly reports until meeting the coverage cri-
12 teria pursuant to section 72-1315, Idaho Code. Upon becoming a covered
13 employer within a calendar year, the quarterly reports for the quarters
14 prior to the employer becoming covered shall be filed along with the
15 quarterly report for the quarter in which the employer became covered.
16 Quarterly reports for the periods subsequent to coverage shall be filed
17 when due after the end of each quarter.
18 (5)(a) Wages paid shall be assigned to the calendar quarter in which the
19 wages were:
20 (i) Actually paid to the employee in accordance with the em-
21 ployer's usual and customary payday as established by law or past
22 practice;
23 (ii) Due the employee in accordance with the employer's usual and
24 customary payday as established by law or past practice but not ac-
25 tually paid on such date because of circumstances beyond the con-
26 trol of the employer or the employee; or
27 (iii) Not paid on the usual or customary payday as established by
28 law or past practice but set apart on the employer's books as an
29 amount due and payable or otherwise recognized as a specific and
30 ascertainable amount due and payable to the worker in accordance
31 with an agreement or contract of hire under which services were
32 rendered.
33 (b) Payments to employees made prior to regular or established pay-
34 days shall be assignable and reportable during the quarter in which
35 they would have been paid unless a practice is established whereby all
36 employees or a class of employees are given an opportunity to take a reg-
37 ular advance against wages, which creates another customary payday.
38 (c) Amounts received as a result of labor relations awards or judg-
39 ments for back pay or for disputed wages constitute wages and shall be
40 reported in the quarter or quarters in which the award or judgment has
41 become final, after all appeals have been exhausted, or the quarter or
42 quarters to which the court assigns the wages, if different.
43 (d) Amounts awarded to the claimant as penalties or damages against the
44 employer, other than for lost wages, do not constitute wages.
45 (6) When wages paid cover services performed both in covered employment
46 and excluded employment, all employee wages shall be deemed to have been
47 earned in covered employment and shall be reported unless the employer's
48 records show the hours and wages for covered employment and excluded employ-
49 ment separately.

24
1 (7)(a) When remuneration paid includes payment in addition to wages for
2 services performed in covered employment, the employer's records shall
3 account for wages and other remuneration separately. When this distri-
4 bution is not shown on the records, the employee's entire remuneration
5 shall be deemed to be wages and shall be reported.
6 (b) When the amount paid to an employee includes remuneration for other
7 than personal services, such as equipment usage and travel costs, the
8 department shall determine the fair market value of the remuneration
9 for the employee's personal services. In making such determination,
10 the department shall consider the wages specified in the contract of
11 hire, the prevailing wages for similar work under comparable condi-
12 tions, and other pertinent factors. The wages so determined by the
13 department shall be reported by the employer.
14 (8) Each covered employer and any other employer requested by the de-
15 partment shall submit status reports on such form or online system as may be
16 prescribed and furnished by the director. The reports shall include such in-
17 formation as may be necessary for the department to make an initial or subse-
18 quent determination of status under this chapter and shall be signed by the
19 employer or the employer's representative duly authorized for such purpose.
20 (9)(a) To determine the taxable status of an employer, information
21 regarding the business activities of any person engaged in business in
22 Idaho shall be submitted to the department upon request, including,
23 without limitation, articles of incorporation, articles of organiza-
24 tion, minutes of boards of directors, financial reports, partnership
25 agreements, number of employees, wages paid, employment contracts,
26 income tax records, and any other records or other information that may
27 tend to establish such person's status.
28 (b) An employer shall be notified in writing of any determination as to
29 its liability for contributions or its status as a covered employer if a
30 formal determination was made after the employer questioned its status.
31 The determination shall become final if no appeal is taken to an appeals
32 examiner within fourteen (14) days of the determination pursuant to the
33 procedures set forth in section 72-1368, Idaho Code.
34 (c) The provisions of this section do not apply to any employer for whom
35 the services performed do not, by virtue of the provisions of section
36 72-1316, Idaho Code, constitute covered employment, except that the de-
37 partment may require any such employer to submit reports as provided in
38 this section.
39 (10) All persons, whether covered or not, shall make available to the
40 department all requested business records, including, without limitation,
41 journals, ledgers, time books, minute books, or any other records or infor-
42 mation that would tend to establish the existence of amounts paid for ser-
43 vices performed, whether or not in covered employment, and for information
44 necessary to assist in or enable collection efforts or any other investiga-
45 tions conducted by the department.
46 (11) Records shall be open to inspection and be subject to being copied
47 by the director at any reasonable time. The director, a member of the com-
48 mission, or an appeals examiner may require from any employer any sworn or
49 unsworn reports which are deemed necessary in the exercise of their duties.

25
1 (12) The department may commence an administrative proceeding for pur-
2 poses of establishing a tax liability or to otherwise enforce the provisions
3 of this chapter by issuing a determination at any time within five (5) years

25 SECTION 19. That Section 72-1342, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
26 amended to read as follows:
27 72-1342. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. (1) Employment security informa-
28 tion, as defined in section 74-106(7), Idaho Code, shall be exempt from dis-
29 closure as provided in chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, except that such in-
30 formation may be disclosed as is necessary for the proper administration of
31 programs under this chapter or may be made available to public officials for
32 use in the performance of official duties subject to such restrictions and
33 fees as the director may by rule prescribe.
34 (2) The director may shall by rule or department policy establish con-
35 fidentiality and disclosure procedures to comply with the requirements of 20
36 CFR 603 and the provisions of chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, including pro-
37 cedures that prescribe the form of written, informed consent by a person that
38 is adequate for disclosure of employment security information pertaining to
39 that person to a third party, as provided in section 74-106(7), Idaho Code,
40 and the security requirements and cost provisions that apply to such disclo-
41 sures.
42 SECTION 20. That Section 72-1349, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
43 amended to read as follows:
44 72-1349. PAYMENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS -- LIMITATION OF ACTIONS. (1) Con-
45 tributions shall be reported and paid to the department on taxable wages for
46 each calendar year equal to the amount determined in accordance with section
47 72-1350, Idaho Code. Contributions on wages paid to an individual under an-

26
1 other state unemployment insurance law, or paid by an employer's predecessor
2 during the calendar year, shall be counted in complying with this provision.
3 (2) Contributions shall accrue and become reportable and payable to the
4 department by each covered employer for each calendar quarter with respect
5 to wages for covered employment. Such contributions shall become due and
6 be paid by each covered employer to the director for the employment security
7 fund and shall not be deducted from the wages of individuals employed by such
8 employer. All moneys required to be paid by a covered employer pursuant to
9 this chapter shall immediately, upon becoming due and payable, become or be
10 deemed money belonging to the state, and every covered employer shall hold
11 or be deemed to hold said money separately, aside, or in trust from any other
12 funds, moneys or accounts, for the state of Idaho for payment in the manner
13 and at the times provided by law.
14 (3) The contributions reportable and payable to the department by each
15 covered employer, with respect to covered employment, and accruing in each
16 calendar quarter, shall be reported and paid to the department on or before
17 the last day of the month following the close of said calendar quarter. If
18 the normal due date falls on a weekend or holiday, the next business day shall
19 be the due date for contributions.
20 (4) Each amount shall be deemed to have been paid on the date that the
21 department receives payment thereof in cash or by check or other order for
22 the payment of money honored by the drawer on presentment. If sent through
23 the mail, the amount shall be deemed to have been paid as of the date mailed as
24 evidenced by the postmark on the envelope containing the contribution.
25 (5) Application of contribution payments shall be done in accordance
26 with department rule or policy.
27 (4) (6) The director may, for good cause shown by a covered employer,
28 extend the time for payment of his contributions or any part thereof, but no
29 such extension of time shall postpone the due date more than sixty (60) days.
30 Contributions with respect to which an extension of time for payment has been
31 granted shall be paid on or before the last day of the period of the exten-
32 sion.
33 (5) (7) Whenever it appears to be essential to the proper administra-
34 tion of this chapter that collection of the contributions of a covered em-
35 ployer must be made more often than quarterly, the director shall have au-
36 thority to demand payment of the contributions forthwith.
37 (6) (8) In accordance with rules the director may prescribe, any person
38 or persons entering into a formal contract with the state, any county, city,
39 town, school or irrigation district, or any quasi-public corporation of the
40 state, for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building
41 or public work, the contract price of which exceeds the sum of one thousand
42 dollars ($1,000), may be required before commencing such work, to execute a
43 surety bond in an amount sufficient to cover contributions when due. If the
44 director, who shall approve said bond, determines that said bond has become
45 insufficient, he may require that a new bond be provided in the amount he di-
46 rects. Failure on the part of the employer covered by the bond to pay the full
47 amount of his contributions when due shall render the surety liable on said
48 bond as though the surety was the employer and subject to the other provi-
49 sions of this chapter.

27
1 (7) (9) In the payment of any contributions a fractional part of a dol-
2 lar shall be disregarded unless it amounts to fifty cents (50¢) or more, in
3 which case it shall be increased to one dollar ($1.00).
4 (8) (10) The director may commence administrative proceedings to en-
5 force the provisions of this section by issuing a determination at any time
6 within five (5) years of the due date of a quarterly report or the date a
7 quarterly report is filed, whichever is later. The limitation period of
8 this subsection (8) is tolled during any period in which the employer ab-
9 sconds from the state, during any period of the employer's concealment, or
10 during any period when the department's ability to commence administrative
11 proceedings to enforce the provisions of this section is stayed by legal
12 proceedings.
13 SECTION 21. That Section 72-1349B, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
14 hereby amended to read as follows:
15 72-1349B. FINANCING OF BENEFITS PAYMENTS BY PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYERS
16 AND THEIR CLIENTS. (1) Nonprofit organizations and governmental entities
17 excepted. Financing of benefits for workers assigned by a professional em-
18 ployer to a nonprofit organization or a governmental entity shall be paid as
19 provided in section 72-1349A, Idaho Code. Financing of benefits for workers
20 assigned by a professional employer to any entity other than a nonprofit
21 organization or governmental entity shall be made in accordance with the
22 provisions of this section.
23 (2) A professional employer organization shall fully comply with the
24 requirements of chapter 24, title 44, Idaho Code, in order to be eligible for
25 any transfers of experience rating as allowed by this section.
26 (3) In order to effect a transfer of a client's experience rating into
27 the experience rating of a professional employer organization, both the
28 client and the professional employer organization shall jointly apply for
29 the transfer of the experience rating within the same time frames as required
30 of employers by section 72-1351(5), Idaho Code, from the date of the contract
31 entered into between the professional employer organization and the client
32 required by section 44-2405, Idaho Code. Failure to submit a timely joint
33 request for transfer of experience rating shall result in the professional
34 employer organization reporting wages for the client under the employer ac-
35 count number of the client.
36 (4) In the event that a client and a professional employer organization
37 jointly apply to transfer the experience rating of the client into that of
38 the professional employer organization, the client's entire experience rat-
39 ing and factors of experience rating shall be transferred into that of the
40 professional employer organization, and no partial transfers of experience
41 factors or the experience rating shall be allowed.
42 (5) If some of the client's workers are included in the professional em-
43 ployer organization arrangement and some are not included, and the profes-
44 sional employer organization and the client elect to report the workers in-
45 cluded in the professional employer organization arrangement under the em-
46 ployer account number of the client, then only one (1) quarterly report shall
47 be remitted to the department, which shall list or include all the client's
48 workers whether or not included in the professional employer organization
49 arrangement.

28
1 (6) If a client employer has employees, services, or employment, one
2 (1) or more of which do not independently meet the coverage or threshold
3 requirements necessary to constitute covered employment, such employees,
4 services, or employment shall nonetheless be deemed to meet the coverage
5 requirements of this chapter if, in combination with other employees, ser-
6 vices, or employment of such other employees of the professional employer
7 organization or any of its clients, such wages, services, or employees
8 jointly meet coverage requirements.
9 (2) (7) Liability for contributions. Unless a professional employer
10 meets the minimum requirements of this chapter, its client shall remain li-
11 able as a covered employer for any payments due under the provisions of this
12 chapter. During the term of a professional employer arrangement, a profes-
13 sional employer is liable for the payment of all moneys due pursuant to this
14 chapter as a result of wages paid to employees assigned to a client company,
15 except compensation paid to sole proprietors or partners in the client com-
16 pany.
17 (3) (8) Joint and several liability. A client is jointly and severally
18 liable for any unpaid moneys due under the provisions of this chapter from
19 the professional employer for wages paid to workers assigned to the client.
20 (4) (9) Reporting requirements. The professional employer shall re-
21 port and make all payments under its state employer account number. The
22 professional employer shall keep separate records and submit separate
23 quarterly wage reports for each of its clients. The professional employer
24 shall pay contributions for its clients collectively using the professional
25 employer's contribution rate unless it elects to pay the contribution for
26 certain clients individually in which instance the contribution shall be
27 paid using the individual client's contribution rate.
28 (10) To report the wages and employees covered by the professional
29 employer organization arrangement between a professional employer organ-
30 ization and client, professional employer organizations and their clients
31 shall make reports to the department in one (1) of the following ways, sub-
32 ject to any conditions in rules promulgated by the department:
33 (a) Report the workers included in the professional employer organiza-
34 tion arrangement under the employer account number of the professional
35 employer organization and transfer the rating of the client to the pro-
36 fessional employer organization; or
37 (b) Report the workers included in the professional employer organiza-
38 tion arrangement under the employer account number of the client with-
39 out an experience rating transfer.
40 (5) (11) Interested party. As between a professional employer and its
41 client, the professional employer company shall be deemed to be the inter-
42 ested party for purposes of section 72-1323, Idaho Code, and all proceedings
43 to determine rights to benefits under the provisions of this chapter.
44 (6) (12) Temporary workers. The provisions of this section do not apply
45 to an entity that provides temporary workers on a temporary help basis, pro-
46 vided that the entity is liable as the employer for all payments due under the
47 provisions of this chapter as a result of wages paid to those temporary work-
48 ers.
49 (7) (13) Rebuttable presumption. When a professional employer assigns
50 workers to only one (1) client and its affiliates, there is a rebuttable pre-

29
1 sumption that the client entered into a professional employer arrangement to
2 avoid calculation of the proper taxable wage rate. If the professional em-
3 ployer fails to rebut this presumption, the director, pursuant to section
4 72-1353, Idaho Code, shall issue an administrative determination of cover-
5 age holding the client to be the covered employer for purposes of this chap-
6 ter.
7 (8) (14) A client ceasing to pay wages. Whenever a client ceases to pay
8 wages, such client shall be subject to termination of its employer account
9 and experience rating records in the same manner as any other employer, in
10 accordance with the provisions of sections 72-1351 and 72-1352, Idaho Code.
11 If a client which that has ceased to pay wages subsequently becomes subject
12 to this chapter because it resumes paying wages, it will be assigned the
13 appropriate experience rate in accordance with the provisions of section
14 72-1351, Idaho Code.
15 (9) (15) Succession of experience factors. Whenever a professional em-
16 ployer arrangement is entered, the separate account and experience factors
17 of payroll and reserve shall be transferred to the professional employer for
18 the purpose of determining the professional employer's contribution rate to
19 be paid on behalf of the client. Upon the expiration or termination of the
20 professional employer arrangement, so much of the professional employer's
21 separate account and experience factors of payroll and reserve as is attrib-
22 utable to the client shall be transferred to the terminating client for the
23 purpose of determining the client's subsequent rate of contribution. In the
24 event the professional employer elects to pay the client's contribution sep-
25 arately as provided in subsection (4) (9) of this section, then the client's
26 experience factors of payroll and reserve shall remain with the client em-
27 ployer for the duration of the professional employer arrangement.
28 SECTION 22. That Section 72-1350, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
29 amended to read as follows:
30 72-1350. TAXABLE WAGE BASE AND TAXABLE WAGE RATES. (1) All remunera-
31 tion for personal services as defined in section 72-1328, Idaho Code, equal
32 to the average annual wage in covered employment for the penultimate cal-
33 endar year, rounded to the nearest multiple of one hundred dollars ($100)
34 or the amount of taxable wage base specified in the federal unemployment
35 tax act, whichever is higher, shall be the taxable wage base for purposes of
36 this chapter. For the purpose of determining the taxable wage base under
37 this chapter, the average annual wage is computed by dividing that calendar
38 year's total wages in covered employment, excluding state government and
39 cost reimbursement employers, by the average number of workers in covered
40 employment for that calendar year as derived from data reported to the de-
41 partment by covered employers.
42 (2) Prior to December 31 of each year, the director shall determine the
43 taxable wage rates for the following calendar year for all covered employ-
44 ers, except cost reimbursement employers, in accordance with this section.
45 If the desired fund size multiplier set forth in subsection (3) of this
46 section is revised with an effective date that is prior to January 1 of the
47 following year, the director shall issue adjusted taxable wage rates as soon
48 as practicable and in accordance with the revised multiplier's effective
49 date. Employers shall receive a credit against future taxes under this act

30
1 for any overpayments resulting from tax payments made before the amended
2 taxable wage rates are adjusted.
3 (3) An average high-cost ratio shall be determined by calculating the
4 average of the three (3) highest benefit cost rates in the twenty (20) year
5 period ending with the preceding year. For the purposes of this section, the
6 "benefit cost rate" is the total annual benefits paid, including the state's
7 share of extended benefits but excluding the federal share of extended ben-
8 efits and cost-reimbursable benefits, divided by the total annual covered
9 wages excluding cost-reimbursable wages. The resulting average high-cost
10 ratio is multiplied by the desired fund size multiplier, and the result, for
11 the purposes of this section, is referred to as the "average high-cost mul-
12 tiple" (AHCM). The desired fund size multiplier shall decrease from one and
13 three-tenths (1.3) to one and two-tenths (1.2) on and after January 1, 2024.
14 (4) The fund balance ratio shall be determined by dividing the actual
15 balance of the employment security fund, section 72-1346, Idaho Code, and
16 the reserve fund, section 72-1347A, Idaho Code, on September 30 of the cur-
17 rent calendar year by the wages paid by all covered employers in Idaho, ex-
18 cept cost-reimbursement employers, in the preceding calendar year.
19 (5) The base tax rate shall be determined as follows:
20 (a) Divide the fund balance ratio by the AHCM;
21 (b) Subtract the quotient obtained from the calculation in paragraph
22 (a) of this subsection from the number two (2);
23 (c) Multiply the remainder obtained from the calculation in paragraph
24 (b) of this subsection by two and one-tenth percent (2.1%). The product
25 obtained from this calculation shall equal the base tax rate, provided
26 that the base tax rate shall not be less than six-tenths percent (0.6%)
27 and shall not exceed three and four-tenths percent (3.4%).
28 (6) The base tax rate calculated in accordance with subsection (5) of
29 this section shall be used to determine the taxable wage rate effective the
30 following calendar year for all covered employers except cost-reimbursement
31 employers as provided in subsections (7) and (8) of this section, except that
32 the base tax rate for calendar years 2022 and 2023 shall be equal to the base
33 tax rate calculated for calendar year 2021.

20 (8) Each covered employer, except cost-reimbursement employers, will
21 be assigned a taxable wage rate and a contribution rate as follows:
22 (a) Each employer, except standard-rated employers, will be assigned
23 to one (1) of the rate classes for eligible and deficit employers pro-
24 vided in subsection (7) of this section based on the employer's experi-
25 ence as determined under the provisions of sections 72-1319, 72-1319A,
26 72-1351 and 72-1351A, Idaho Code.
27 (b) For each rate class provided in subsection (7) of this section, the
28 department will multiply the base tax rate determined in accordance
29 with subsection (5) of this section by the tax factor listed for that
30 rate class in the table provided in subsection (7) of this section. The
31 product obtained from this calculation shall be the taxable wage rate
32 for employers assigned to that rate class, provided that the taxable
33 wage rate shall not be less than the minimum taxable wage rate assigned
34 to that rate class and shall not exceed the maximum taxable wage rate
35 assigned to that rate class in the table provided in subsection (7) of
36 this section.
37 (c) For standard-rated employers, the department will multiply the
38 base tax rate determined in accordance with subsection (5) of this
39 section by the tax factor listed for standard-rated employers in the
40 table provided in subsection (7) of this section. The product obtained
41 from this calculation shall be the taxable wage rate for standard-rated
42 employers, provided that the taxable wage rate shall not be less than
43 the minimum taxable wage rate assigned to standard-rated employers

32
1 and shall not exceed the maximum taxable wage rate assigned to stan-
2 dard-rated employers in the table provided in subsection (7) of this
3 section.
4 (d) Deficit employers who have been assigned a taxable wage rate from
5 deficit rate class 6 will be assigned contribution rates equal to their
6 taxable wage rate.
7 (e) All other eligible, standard-rated, and deficit employers will
8 be assigned contribution rates equal to ninety-seven percent (97%) of
9 their taxable wage rate. Provided however, that for each calendar year
10 a reserve tax is imposed pursuant to section 72-1347A, Idaho Code, the
11 contribution rates for employers assigned contribution rates pursuant
12 to this paragraph shall be eighty percent (80%) of their taxable wage
13 rate.
14 (9) Each employer shall be notified of his taxable wage rate as deter-
15 mined for any calendar year pursuant to this section and section 72-1351,
16 Idaho Code. Such determination shall become conclusive and binding upon
17 the employer, unless within fourteen (14) days after notice as provided in
18 section 72-1368(5), Idaho Code, the employer files an application for re-
19 determination, setting forth his reasons therefor. Reconsideration shall
20 be limited to transactions occurring subsequent to any previous determina-
21 tion that has become final. The employer shall be promptly notified of the
22 redetermination, which shall become final unless an appeal is filed within
23 fourteen (14) days after notice as provided in section 72-1368(5), Idaho
24 Code. Proceedings on the appeal shall be in accordance with the provisions
25 of section 72-1361, Idaho Code.
26 SECTION 23. That Section 72-1351, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
27 amended to read as follows:
28 72-1351. EXPERIENCE RATING AND VOLUNTARY TRANSFERS OF EXPERIENCE RAT-
29 ING ACCOUNTS. (1) Subject to the other provisions of this chapter, each eli-
30 gible and deficit employer's, except cost reimbursement employers, taxable
31 wage rate shall be determined in the manner set forth in this subsection for
32 each calendar year:
33 (a)(i) Each eligible employer shall be given an "experience fac-
34 tor" which shall be the ratio of excess of contributions over ben-
35 efits paid on the employer's account since December 31, 1939, to
36 his average annual taxable payroll rounded to the next lower dol-
37 lar amount for the four (4) fiscal years immediately preceding the
38 computation date, except that when an employer first becomes eli-
39 gible, his "experience factor" will be computed on his average an-
40 nual taxable payroll for the two (2) fiscal years or more, but not
41 to exceed four (4) fiscal years, immediately preceding the compu-
42 tation date. The computation of such "experience factor" shall be
43 to six (6) decimal places.
44 (ii) Each deficit employer shall be given a "deficit experience
45 factor" which shall be the ratio of excess of benefits paid on the
46 employer's account over contributions since December 31, 1939, to
47 his average annual taxable payroll rounded to the next lower dol-
48 lar amount for one (1) or more fiscal years, but not to exceed four
49 (4) fiscal years, for which he had covered employment ending on

33
1 the computation date; provided, however, that any employer who, on
2 any computation date has a "deficit experience factor" for the pe-
3 riod immediately preceding such computation date but who has filed
4 all reports, paid all contributions and penalties due on or before
5 the cutoff date, and has during the last four (4) fiscal years paid
6 contributions at a rate of not less than the standard rate applica-
7 ble for each such year and in excess of benefits charged to his ex-
8 perience rating account during such years, shall have any balance
9 of benefits charged to his account, which on the computation date
10 immediately preceding such four (4) fiscal years was in excess of
11 contributions paid, deleted from his account, and the excess ben-
12 efits so deleted shall not be considered in the computation of his
13 taxable wage rate for the rate years following such four (4) fiscal
14 years. For the rate year following such computation date, he shall
15 be given the standard rate for that year.
16 (iii) In the event an employer's coverage has been terminated be-
17 cause he has ceased to do business or because he has not had covered
18 employment for a period of four (4) years, and if said employer
19 thereafter becomes a covered employer, he will be considered as
20 though he were a new employer, and he shall not be credited with his
21 previous experience under this chapter for the purpose of comput-
22 ing any future "experience factor."
23 (iv) Benefits paid to a claimant whose employment terminated be-
24 cause the claimant's employer was called to active military duty
25 shall not be used as a factor in determining the taxable wage rate
26 of that employer.
27 (b) Schedules shall be prepared listing all eligible employers in in-
28 verse numerical order of their experience factors, and all deficit em-
29 ployers in numerical order of their deficit experience factors. There
30 shall be listed on such schedules for each such employer in addition to
31 the experience factor: (i) the amount of his taxable payroll for the
32 fiscal year ending on the computation date, and (ii) a cumulative total
33 consisting of the sum of such employer's taxable payroll for the fiscal
34 year ending on the computation date and the corresponding taxable pay-
35 rolls for all other employers preceding him on such schedules.
36 (c) The cumulative taxable payroll amounts listed on the schedules pro-
37 vided for in paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be segregated into
38 groups whose limits shall be those set out in the table provided in sec-
39 tion 72-1350(7), Idaho Code. Each of such groups shall be identified
40 by the rate class number listed in the table which represents the per-
41 centage limits of each group. Each employer on the schedules shall be
42 assigned a taxable wage rate in accordance with section 72-1350, Idaho
43 Code.
44 (d)(i) If the grouping of rate classes requires the inclusion of
45 exactly one-half (1/2) of an employer's taxable payroll, the em-
46 ployer shall be assigned the lower of the two (2) rates designated
47 for the two (2) classes in which the halves of his taxable payroll
48 are so required.
49 (ii) If the group of rate classes requires the inclusion of a por-
50 tion other than exactly one-half (1/2) of an employer's taxable

34
1 payroll, the employer shall be assigned the rate designated for
2 the class in which the greater part of his taxable payroll is so re-
3 quired.
4 (iii) If one (1) or more employers on the schedules have experi-
5 ence factors identical to that of the last employer included in a
6 particular rate class, all such employers shall be included in and
7 assigned the taxable wage rate specified for such class, notwith-
8 standing the provisions of paragraph (c) of this subsection.
9 (e) If the taxable payroll amount or the experience factor or both
10 such taxable payroll amount and experience factor of any eligible or
11 deficit employer listed on the schedules is changed, the employer shall
12 be placed in that position on the schedules which he would have occu-
13 pied had his taxable payroll amount and/or experience factor as changed
14 been used in determining his position in the first instance, but such
15 change shall not affect the position or rate classification of any other
16 employer listed on the schedules and shall not affect the rate determi-
17 nation for previous years.
18 (2) For experience rating purposes, all previously accumulated benefit
19 charges to covered employers' accounts, except cost reimbursement employ-
20 ers, shall not be changed except as provided in this chapter. Benefits paid
21 prior to June 30 shall, as of June 30 of each year preceding the calendar year
22 for which a covered employer's taxable wage rate is effective, be charged to
23 the account of the covered employer, except cost reimbursement employers,
24 who paid the largest individual amount of base period wages as shown on the
25 determination used as the basis for the payment of such benefits, except that
26 no charge shall be made to the account of such covered employer with respect
27 to benefits paid under the following situations:
28 (a) If paid to a worker who terminated his services voluntarily without
29 good cause attributable to such covered employer, with good cause but
30 for reasons not attributable to such covered employer, or who had been
31 discharged for workplace misconduct in connection with such services;
32 (b) If paid in accordance with the provisions of section 72-1368(10),
33 Idaho Code, and the decision to pay benefits is subsequently reversed;
34 (c) For that portion of benefits paid to multistate claimants pursuant
35 to section 72-1344, Idaho Code, which exceeds the amount of benefits
36 that would have been charged had only Idaho wages been used in paying the
37 claim;
38 (d) If paid in accordance with the extended benefit program triggered
39 by either national or state indicators;
40 (e) If paid to a worker who continues to perform services for such cov-
41 ered employer without a reduction in his customary work schedule, and
42 who is eligible to receive benefits due to layoff or a reduction in earn-
43 ings from another employer; or
44 (f) If paid to a worker who turns down an offer of suitable work because
45 of participation in a job training program pursuant to the requirements
46 of section 72-1366(8), Idaho Code.
47 (3) A covered employer whose experience rating account is chargeable,
48 as prescribed by this section, is an interested party as defined in sec-
49 tion 72-1323, Idaho Code. A determination of chargeability shall become
50 final unless, within fourteen (14) days after notice as provided in section

35
1 72-1368(5), Idaho Code, an appeal is filed by an interested party with the
2 department in accordance with the department's rules. Appeal proceedings
3 shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 72-1361, Idaho Code.
4 (4)(a) An experience rating record shall be maintained for each covered
5 employer. The record shall be credited with all contributions which the
6 covered employer has paid for covered employment prior to the cutoff
7 date, pursuant to the provisions of this and preceding acts, and which
8 covered employment occurred prior to the computation date. The record
9 shall also be charged with the amount of benefits paid which are charge-
10 able to the covered employer's account as provided by the appropriate
11 provisions of the employment security law and regulations thereunder
12 in effect at the time such benefits were paid. Nothing in this section
13 shall be construed to grant any covered employer or individual in his
14 service a priority with respect to any claim or right because of amounts
15 paid by such covered employer into the employment security fund.
16 (b) Except those meeting the requirements of section 72-1349B, Idaho
17 Code, each person or entity paying wages directly, or indirectly
18 through arrangements in which payroll is consolidated for multiple per-
19 sons or entities, shall maintain separate records and shall report the
20 wages in accordance with this chapter. The wages for one (1) person or
21 entity may not be reported under the assigned record of another, even
22 where the people or entities are related.
23 (5)(a) Whenever any individual or type of organization, whether or not
24 a covered employer within the meaning of section 72-1315, Idaho Code,
25 in any manner succeeds to, or acquires all or substantially all, of the
26 business of an employer who at the time of acquisition was a covered
27 employer, and in respect to whom the director finds that the business
28 of the predecessor is continued solely by the successor, the separate
29 experience rating account of the predecessor shall, upon the joint ap-
30 plication of the predecessor and the successor within the one hundred
31 eighty (180) days after such acquisition and approval by the director,
32 be transferred to the successor employer for the purpose of determining
33 such successor's liability and taxable wage rate, and any successor who
34 was not an employer on the date of acquisition shall, as of such date,
35 become a covered employer as defined in this chapter. Such one hundred
36 eighty (180) day period may be extended at the discretion of the direc-
37 tor.
38 (b) Whenever any individual or type of organization, whether or not a
39 covered employer within the meaning of section 72-1315, Idaho Code, in
40 any manner succeeds to, or acquires, part of the business of an employer
41 who at the time of acquisition was a covered employer, and such portion
42 of the business is continued by the successor, so much of the separate
43 experience rating account of the predecessor as is attributable to the
44 portion of the business transferred, as determined on a pro rata basis
45 in the same ratio that the wages of covered employees properly allocable
46 to the transferred portion of the business bears to the payroll of the
47 predecessor in the last four (4) completed calendar quarters immedi-
48 ately preceding the date of transfer, shall, upon the joint application
49 of the predecessor and the successor within one hundred eighty (180)
50 days after such acquisition and approval by the director, be trans-

36
1 ferred to the successor employer for the purpose of determining such
2 successor's liability and taxable wage rate, and any successor who was
3 not an employer on the date of acquisition shall, as of such date, become
4 a covered employer as defined in this chapter. Such one hundred eighty
5 (180) day period may be extended at the discretion of the director.
6 (c)(i) If the successor was a covered employer prior to the date
7 of the acquisition of all or a part of the predecessor's business,
8 his taxable wage rate, effective the first day of the calendar
9 quarter immediately following the date of acquisition, shall be a
10 newly computed rate based on the combined experience of the prede-
11 cessor and successor, the resulting rate remaining in effect the
12 balance of the rate year.
13 (ii) If the successor was not a covered employer prior to the date
14 of the acquisition of all or a part of the predecessor's business,
15 his rate shall be the rate applicable to the predecessor with re-
16 spect to the period immediately preceding the date of acquisition,
17 but if there were was more than one (1) predecessor, the succes-
18 sor's rate shall be a newly computed rate based on the combined ex-
19 perience of the predecessors, becoming effective immediately af-
20 ter the date of acquisition, and shall remain in effect the balance
21 of the rate year.
22 (d) For purposes of this section, an employer's experience rating ac-
23 count shall consist of the actual contribution, benefit and taxable
24 payroll experience of the employer and any amounts due from the employer
25 under this chapter. When a transferred experience rating account
26 includes amounts due from the employer under this chapter, both the
27 predecessor employer and the successor employer shall be jointly and
28 severally liable for those amounts.
29 SECTION 24. That Section 72-1351A, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
30 hereby amended to read as follows:
31 72-1351A. MANDATORY TRANSFERS OF EXPERIENCE RATING ACCOUNTS AND FED-
32 ERAL CONFORMITY PROVISIONS REGARDING TRANSFERS OF EXPERIENCE AND ASSIGNMENT
33 OF RATES. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the following
34 shall apply regarding transfers of experience and assignment of rates:
35 (1)(a) If a covered employer transfers its trade or business, or a por-
36 tion thereof, to another employer, whether or not a covered employer
37 within the meaning of section 72-1315, Idaho Code, and, at the time of
38 the transfer, there is substantially common ownership, management or
39 control of the two (2) employers, then the experience rating account
40 attributable to the transferred trade or business shall be transferred
41 to the employer to whom such business is so transferred. The rates of
42 both employers shall be recalculated using the methods provided in sec-
43 tion 72-1351(5)(b) and either (c)(i) or (c)(ii), Idaho Code. Whenever
44 such mandatory transfer involves only a portion of the experience rat-
45 ing record, and the predecessor or successor employers fail within ten
46 (10) days after notice to supply the required payroll information, the
47 transfer may be based on estimates of the allocable payrolls.
48 (i) For partial transfers of an experience rating record, the pro
49 rata share of the experience rate to be transferred shall be com-

37
1 puted based on the four (4) most recently completed quarters re-
2 ported by the predecessor employer prior to the date of acquisi-
3 tion or change in entity.
4 (ii) When a total transfer of experience rating record has been
5 completed and the predecessor employer continues to have employ-
6 ment in connection with the liquidation of his business, the pre-
7 decessor employer shall continue to pay contributions at the as-
8 signed rate for the period of liquidation but not beyond the bal-
9 ance of the rate year.
10 (iii) In determining whether the ownership or management or con-
11 trol of a successor employer is substantially the same as the own-
12 ership or management or control of the predecessor employer, fac-
13 tors to be considered include, without limitation, the extent of
14 policy-making authority, the involvement in daily management of
15 operations, the supervision over the workforce, the percentage of
16 ownership of shares or assets, and the involvement on boards of di-
17 rectors or other controlling bodies.
18 (iv) A successor employer may use wages paid by the predecessor
19 employer to arrive at the wage base for purposes of calculating
20 taxable wages only when the experience rate of a predecessor em-
21 ployer has been transferred to a successor employer.
22 (b) If, following a transfer of experience under paragraph (a) of this
23 subsection, the director determines that a substantial purpose of the
24 transfer of the trade or business was to obtain a reduced liability for
25 contributions, then the experience rating accounts of the employers in-
26 volved shall be combined into a single account and a single rate shall be
27 assigned to such account.
28 (2) Whenever a person who is not a covered employer under this chapter
29 at the time such person acquires the trade or business of a covered employer,
30 the experience rating account of the acquired business shall not be trans-
31 ferred to such person if the director finds that such person acquired the
32 business primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contribu-
33 tions. Instead, such person shall be assigned the standard rate for new
34 employers under section 72-1350, Idaho Code. In determining whether the
35 trade or business was acquired primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower
36 rate of contributions, the director shall use objective factors which may
37 include, but are not limited to, the cost of acquiring the business, whether
38 the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired business, how
39 long such business enterprise was continued, or whether a substantial number
40 of new employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the busi-
41 ness activity conducted prior to acquisition.
42 (3)(a) It shall be a violation of this section if a person:
43 (i) Makes any false statement to the department when the maker
44 knows the statement to be false or acts with deliberate ignorance
45 of or reckless disregard for the truth of the matter or willfully
46 fails to disclose a material fact to the department in connection
47 with the transfer of a trade or business;
48 (ii) Prepares any false or antedated report, form, book, paper,
49 record, written instrument, or other matter or thing in connection

38
1 with the transfer of a trade or business with the intent to submit
2 it or allow it to be submitted to the department as genuine or true;
3 (iii) Knowingly violates or attempts to violate subsection (1) or
4 (2) of this section or any other provision of this chapter related
5 to determining the assignment of a contribution rate or an experi-
6 ence rate; or
7 (iv) Knowingly advises another person in a way that results in a
8 violation or an attempted violation of subsection (1) or (2) of
9 this section or any other provision of this chapter related to de-
10 termining the assignment of a contribution rate or an experience
11 rate.
12 (b) If a person commits any of the acts described in paragraph (a) of
13 this subsection, the person shall be subject to the following penal-
14 ties:
15 (i) If the person is a covered employer, a civil money penalty of
16 ten percent (10%) of such person's taxable wages for the four (4)
17 completed consecutive quarters preceding the violation shall be
18 imposed for such year and said penalty shall be deposited in the
19 state employment security administrative and reimbursement fund
20 as established by section 72-1348, Idaho Code.
21 (ii) If the person is not a covered employer, such person shall
22 be subject to a civil money penalty of not more than five thousand
23 dollars ($5,000) for each violation. Any such penalty shall be de-
24 posited in the state employment security administrative and reim-
25 bursement fund as established by section 72-1348, Idaho Code.
26 (4) Every person who knowingly makes any false statement to the depart-
27 ment or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact to the department in con-
28 nection with the transfer of a trade or business, or knowingly prepares any
29 false or antedated report, form, book, paper, record, written instrument, or
30 other matter or thing in connection with the transfer of a trade or business
31 with the intent to submit it or allow it to be submitted to the department
32 as genuine or true, or knowingly violates or attempts to violate subsection
33 (1) or (2) of this section or any other provision of this chapter related to
34 determining the assignment of a contribution rate or an experience rate, or
35 knowingly advises another person to act in a way that results in a violation
36 or an attempted violation of subsection (1) or (2) of this section or any
37 other provision of this chapter related to determining the assignment of a
38 contribution rate or an experience rate, shall be guilty of a felony punish-
39 able as provided in section 18-112, Idaho Code.
40 (5) For purposes of this section:
41 (a) An employer's experience rating account shall consist of
42 "Experience rating account" means the actual contribution, benefit and
43 taxable payroll experience of the employer and any amounts due from the
44 employer under this chapter. When a transferred experience rating ac-
45 count includes amounts due from the employer under this chapter, both
46 the predecessor employer and the successor employer shall be jointly
47 and severally liable for those amounts.
48 (b) "Knowingly" means having actual knowledge of or acting with delib-
49 erate ignorance of or reckless disregard for the prohibition involved.

39
1 (c) "Person" has the meaning given such term by section 7701(a)(1) of
2 the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 7701(a)(1)).
3 (d) A "transfer of a trade or business" occurs whenever a person in any
4 manner acquires or succeeds to all or a portion of a trade or business.
5 Factors the department may consider when determining whether a transfer
6 of a trade or business has occurred include, but are not limited to, the
7 following:
8 (i) Whether the successor continued the business enterprise of
9 the acquired business;
10 (ii) Whether the successor purchased, leased or assumed ma-
11 chinery and manufacturing equipment, office equipment, business
12 premises, the business or corporate name, inventories, a covenant
13 not to compete or a list of customers;
14 (iii) Continuity of business relationships with third parties
15 such as vendors, suppliers and subcontractors;
16 (iv) A transfer of good will;
17 (v) A transfer of accounts receivable;
18 (vi) Possession and use of the predecessor's sales correspon-
19 dence; and
20 (vii) Whether the employees remained the same.
21 (e) "Trade or business" includes, but is not limited to, the employer's
22 workforce. The transfer of some or all of an employer's workforce to
23 another employer shall be considered a transfer of a trade or business
24 when, as the result of such transfer, the transferring employer no
25 longer performs trade or business with respect to the transferred work-
26 force, and such trade or business is performed by the employer to whom
27 the workforce is transferred.
28 (f) "Violates or attempts to violate" includes, but is not limited to,
29 intent to evade, misrepresentation or willful nondisclosure.
30 (6) The director shall establish procedures to identify the transfer or
31 acquisition of a business for purposes of this section.

37 vided in section 72-1368(5), Idaho Code, an appeal is filed with the depart-
38 ment in accordance with the department's rules. Appeal proceedings shall be
39 in accordance with the provisions of section 72-1361, Idaho Code.

41 able to the request.
42 (6)(a) An individual filing a new claim for benefits shall, at the time

21 SECTION 28. That Section 72-1366, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
22 amended to read as follows:

24 conditions of a benefit claimant are that:
25 (1) The claimant shall have made a claim for benefits, and provided all
26 necessary information pertinent to eligibility, and demonstrated that he is
27 eligible for benefits and not disqualified; except that in the case of dis-
28 charges from employment, the employer shall have the burden of demonstrating
29 the discharge was for workplace misconduct.
30 (2) The claimant shall have registered for work and thereafter reported
31 to a job service office or other agency in a manner prescribed by the direc-
32 tor.
33 (3) The claimant shall have met the minimum wage requirements in his

35 (4)(a) During the whole of any week with respect to which he claims ben-
36 efits or credit to his waiting period, the claimant was:
37 (i) Able to work,;
38 (ii) aAvailable for suitable work, and;
39 (iii) Actively seeking work by conducting no fewer than five (5)
40 work search actions per week; provided, however, that no claimant
41 shall be considered ineligible for failure to comply with the pro-
42 visions of this subsection paragraph if:
43 1. Such failure is due to a claimant's illness or disabil-
44 ity of no more than four (4) weeks that arises after filing
45 a claim, provided that during such illness or disability,
46 the claimant does not refuse or miss suitable work that
47 would have provided wages greater than one-half (1/2) of the
48 claimant's weekly benefit amount; or

45
1 2. Such failure is due to compelling personal circum-
2 stances, provided that such failure does not exceed a minor
3 portion of the claimant's workweek and during which time
4 the claimant does not refuse or miss suitable work that
5 would have provided wages greater than one-half (1/2) of the
6 claimant's weekly benefit amount; and
7 (ii) (iv) Living in a state, territory, or country that is in-
8 cluded in the interstate benefit payment plan or that is a party to
9 an agreement with the United States or the director with respect to
10 unemployment insurance.
11 (b) An action shall be considered an acceptable work search action pur-
12 suant to paragraph (a) of this subsection if it consists of one (1) or
13 more of the following actions in any week:
14 (i) Completing an online or in-person job search workshop;
15 (ii) Completing a job search assessment, including but not lim-
16 ited to a personality, skills, or interests assessment;
17 (iii) Completing career direction research or work such as a job

30 (c) If a claimant who is enrolled in an approved job training course
31 pursuant to subsection (8) of this section fails to attend or otherwise
32 participate in the job training course during any week with respect to
33 which he claims benefits or credit to his waiting period, the claimant
34 shall be ineligible for that week if he was not able to work nor avail-
35 able for suitable work, to be determined as follows: The claimant shall
36 be ineligible unless he is making satisfactory progress in the training
37 and his failure to attend or otherwise participate was due to:
38 (i) The claimant's illness or disability that occurred after he
39 had filed a claim and the claimant missed fewer than one-half (1/2)
40 of the classes available to him that week; or
41 (ii) Compelling personal circumstances, provided that the
42 claimant missed fewer than one-half (1/2) of the classes available
43 to him that week.
44 (d) A claimant shall not be denied regular unemployment benefits under
45 any provision of this chapter relating to availability for work, active
46 search for work or refusal to accept work solely because the claimant is
47 seeking only part-time work if the department determines that a major-
48 ity of the weeks of work in the claimant's base period were for less than
49 full-time work. For the purpose of this subsection, "seeking only part-
50 time work" is defined as seeking work that has comparable hours to the

46
1 claimant's part-time work experience in the base period, except that a
2 claimant must be available for at least twenty (20) hours of work per
3 week.
4 (e) A claimant must seek work as directed by the department. A claimant
5 must meet the requirements of the code to which the claimant is as-
6 signed. Failure to comply with work-seeking requirements will result
7 in a denial of benefits. For the purpose of administering the work
8 search requirements of this subsection and subsection (6) of this
9 section, a claimant will be coded according to his attachment to an em-
10 ployer or industry, as follows:
11 (i) Attached. A claimant who has a firm attachment to an em-
12 ployer, industry, or union, or who is temporarily or seasonally
13 unemployed, and expects to return to his former job or employer
14 in a reasonable length of time not to exceed sixteen (16) weeks,
15 provided the claimant maintains reasonable contact with his em-
16 ployer. If during the sixteen (16) weeks the claimant returns to
17 work temporarily for the job attached employer, the claimant's
18 period of job attachment will be extended by one (1) week for each
19 week of verified full-time employment as defined by this chapter;
20 (ii) Work-seeking. A claimant who possesses marketable skills in
21 an occupation, but has no immediate prospects for reemployment,
22 and whose employment expectations, wages, hours, and other condi-
23 tions of employment are realistic in relation to the normal labor
24 market supply and demand in his area of availability; or
25 (iii) Approved training. A claimant who is assigned to a training
26 course under the provisions of subsection (8) of this section.
27 (f) A claimant must provide or be capable of obtaining a license or per-
28 mit if required by law for performance of the work.
29 (g) A claimant must apply for and accept a lower or beginning pay rate
30 for employment if he has no prospects for a better-paying job in the lo-
31 cality.
32 (h) A claimant who is regularly employed on a seasonal basis must be
33 available for other types of work in the off-season to be eligible for
34 benefits.
35 (5)(a) The claimant's unemployment is not due to the claimant voluntar-
36 ily leaving employment without good cause connected with the claimant's
37 employment or because of the claimant's discharge for workplace miscon-
38 duct in connection with the claimant's employment.
39 (b) The requirement that good cause for a voluntary leaving of employ-
40 ment be in connection with employment does not apply and good cause is
41 shown where a claimant demonstrates that:
42 (a)(i) The leaving was necessary to protect the claimant or any
43 minor child of the claimant from domestic violence or the leaving
44 was due to domestic violence that caused the claimant to rea-
45 sonably believe that the claimant's continued employment would
46 jeopardize the safety of the claimant or any minor child of the
47 claimant; and (ii) The the claimant made all reasonable efforts to
48 preserve the employment; or
49 (b) (ii) The claimant is a military spouse who voluntarily
50 left the claimant's most recent employment to relocate with the

47
1 claimant's spouse who, because of a permanent change of station
2 orders, was required to move to a location from which the commute
3 to the claimant's most recent employment was impractical, but
4 only if, before leaving, the claimant took reasonable actions to
5 maintain the employment relationship through accommodation dis-
6 cussions with the claimant's employer.; or
7 (iii) The claimant quit a temporary job for a permanent job or quit
8 part-time employment for employment with an increase in the number
9 of hours worked.
10 (c) The following definitions apply to this subsection:
11 (i) "Domestic violence" is as defined in section 39-6303, Idaho
12 Code, and also includes the crime of stalking in the second degree
13 pursuant to section 18-7906, Idaho Code;
14 (ii) "Military spouse" means the spouse of a member of the armed
15 forces of the United States or a reserve component of the armed
16 forces of the United States stationed in this state in accordance
17 with military orders or stationed in this state before a reassign-
18 ment to duties outside this state; and
19 (iii) "Permanent change of station orders" means the assignment,
20 reassignment, or transfer of a member of the armed forces of the
21 United States or a reserve component of the armed forces of the
22 United States from the member's present duty station or location
23 without return to the previous duty station or location.
24 (d) Good cause connected with employment exists when a claimant's rea-
25 sons for leaving the employment arise from the working conditions, job
26 tasks, or employment agreement. If the claimant's reasons for leaving
27 the employment arise from personal or other matters unrelated to em-
28 ployment, the reasons are not connected with the claimant's employment.
29 (i) The standard of what constitutes good cause is the standard
30 of reasonableness as applied to the average adult. Whether good
31 cause is present depends on whether a reasonable person would con-
32 sider the circumstances resulting in the claimant's unemployment
33 to be real, substantial, and compelling.
34 (ii) A claimant who leaves a job because of a reasonable and seri-
35 ous objection to the work requirements of the employer on moral or
36 ethical grounds and is otherwise eligible shall not be denied ben-
37 efits.
38 (iii) A claimant whose unemployment is due to his health or physi-
39 cal condition that makes it impossible for him to continue to per-
40 form the duties of the job shall be deemed to have quit work with
41 good cause connected with employment.
42 (iv) An individual who has continuing suitable work available and
43 who voluntarily elects to retire or to terminate employment during
44 a period of reorganization or downsizing shall be deemed to have
45 voluntarily quit the employment for personal reasons.
46 (v) The eligibility of a claimant discharged before a pending
47 resignation has occurred for reasons unrelated to the pending res-
48 ignation shall be determined on the basis of the discharge.
49 (vi) If a claimant had given notice of a pending resignation but
50 was discharged before the effective date of the resignation, both

48
1 separations shall be considered. The following three (3) elements
2 must be present for both actions to affect the claimant's eligi-
3 bility:
4 1. The employee gave notice to the employer of a specific
5 separation date;
6 2. The employer's decision to discharge the claimant before
7 the effective date of the resignation was a consequence of
8 the pending separation; and
9 3. The discharge occurred a short time prior to the effec-
10 tive date of the resignation.
11 (vii) Good cause for quitting employment may be established by
12 showing the claimant was subjected to harassment that is unlawful
13 pursuant to the provisions of chapter 59, title 67, Idaho Code.
14 (e) If a claimant has resigned after receiving a notice of discharge or
15 lay off due to a lack of work, but before the effective date of the dis-
16 charge, both separations shall be considered. The following three (3)
17 elements must be present for both actions to affect the claimant's eli-
18 gibility:
19 (i) The employee was given notice by the employer of a specific
20 separation date;
21 (ii) The employee's decision to quit before the effective date of
22 the termination was a consequence of the pending separation; and
23 (iii) The voluntary quit occurred a short time prior to the effec-
24 tive date of the termination.
25 (f) A claimant who has been suspended without pay for an indefinite pe-
26 riod of time and who has not been given a date to return to work shall be
27 considered discharged.
28 (6)(a) The claimant's unemployment is not due to his failure without
29 good cause to apply for available suitable work or to accept suitable
30 work within seven (7) days of when it is offered to him, unless a con-
31 dition specified in subsection (8) of this section applies or the job
32 offered does not constitute suitable employment pursuant to the pro-
33 visions of subsection (9) of this section. A claimant has the respon-
34 sibility to apply for and accept suitable work. The longer a claimant
35 has been unemployed, the more willing he must be to seek other types
36 of work and accept work at a lower rate of pay. Failure to appear for a
37 previously scheduled job interview without notifying the employer of
38 the need to cancel or reschedule shall constitute a failure to apply for
39 suitable work for that week.
40 (b) The department shall establish an email address and web portal that
41 allows employers to report suspected violations of this subsection. As
42 part of its regular communication with employers, the department shall
43 at least annually inform employers of the email address and web portal
44 described in this subsection and the mechanism to report suspected vio-
45 lations.
46 (c) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, a good cause
47 reason for not applying for available and suitable work or responding to
48 an offer of suitable employment shall be found only if the claimant is
49 ill, injured, or delayed by reason of an accident or medical emergency
50 involving the claimant or a member of the claimant's immediate family.

49
1 (d) To have good cause to refuse to apply for or accept available suit-
2 able work because of personal circumstances, a claimant must show that
3 his circumstances were so compelling that a reasonably prudent individ-
4 ual would have acted in the same manner under the same circumstances.
5 For purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, good cause includes
6 but is not limited to circumstances where:
7 (i) The work would require the claimant to work on days contrary
8 to his religious convictions;
9 (ii) The claimant has reasonable, serious objections to the work
10 or the workplace on moral or ethical grounds;
11 (iii) The claimant has excellent prospects for more suitable work
12 with his former employer or in his regular occupation;
13 (iv) The claimant is unable to meet an employer's restrictions on
14 citizenship or residency;
15 (v) The travel distance to available work is excessive or unrea-
16 sonable. A claimant is ineligible if he fails to apply for and ac-
17 cept suitable work within a commuting area similar to other work-
18 ers in his area and occupation; and
19 (vi) The claimant cannot meet government requirements within a
20 reasonable period of time.
21 (e) A claimant shall be ineligible for benefits if:
22 (i) The claimant causes an employer to withdraw an offer of suit-
23 able work or terminate the offer after the claimant has accepted
24 it;
25 (ii) The claimant fails without good cause to comply with rea-
26 sonable, lawful requirements that are typical of certain occupa-
27 tions, such as a requirement that a worker be bonded;
28 (iii) The claimant, after being laid off, fails to return to work
29 on the date specified by the employer at the time of layoff or fails
30 to respond to a callback after a layoff; and
31 (iv) The claimant fails to report to the department when so di-
32 rected, fails to follow explicit instructions for applying for
33 available suitable work, or fails to report to work after accept-
34 ing employment, without good cause.
35 (f) A claimant must be available for and willing to accept suitable
36 part-time work in the absence of suitable full-time work.
37 (7) In determining whether or not work is suitable for an individual,
38 the degree of risk involved to his health, safety, morals, physical fitness,
39 experience, training, past earnings, length of unemployment and prospects
40 for obtaining local employment in his customary occupation, the distance of
41 the work from his residence, and other pertinent factors shall be consid-
42 ered. No employment shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall not be de-
43 nied to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work or
44 to hold himself available for work under any of the following conditions:
45 (a) If the vacancy of the position offered is due directly to a strike,
46 lockout, or other labor dispute;
47 (b) If the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are
48 below those prevailing for similar work in the locality of the work of-
49 fered;

50
1 (c) If, as a condition of being employed, the individual would be re-
2 quired to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining
3 any bona fide labor organization.
4 (8) No claimant who is otherwise eligible shall be denied benefits for
5 any week due to an inability to comply with the requirements contained in
6 subsections (4)(a)(i) and (6) of this section if:
7 (a) The claimant is a participant in a program sponsored by title I of
8 the workforce innovation and opportunity act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq., as
9 amended) and attends a job training course under that program; or
10 (b) The claimant attends a job training course authorized pursuant to
11 the provisions of section 236(a)(1) of the trade act of 1974 or the North
12 American free trade agreement implementation act.
13 (c) The claimant lacks skills to compete in the labor market and attends
14 a job training course with the approval of the director. The director
15 may approve job training courses that meet the following criteria:
16 (i) The purpose of the job training is to teach the claimant
17 skills that will enhance the claimant's opportunities for employ-
18 ment; and
19 (ii) The job training can be completed within two (2) years, ex-
20 cept that this requirement may be waived pursuant to rules that the
21 director may prescribe.
22 (9) No claimant who is otherwise eligible shall be denied benefits
23 under subsection (5) of this section for leaving employment to attend job
24 training pursuant to subsection (8) of this section, provided that the
25 claimant obtained the employment after enrollment in or during scheduled
26 breaks in the job training course or that the employment was not suitable.
27 For purposes of this subsection, the term "suitable employment" means work
28 of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the individual's past
29 employment and wages for such work are no less than eighty percent (80%) of
30 the average weekly wage in the individual's past employment.
31 (10)(a) A claimant shall not be eligible to receive benefits for any
32 week with respect to which it is found that his unemployment is due to a
33 labor dispute; provided, that this subsection shall not apply if it is
34 shown that:
35 (a) (i) The claimant is not participating, financing, aiding,
36 abetting, or directly interested in the labor dispute; and
37 (b) (ii) The claimant does not belong to a grade or class of work-
38 ers with members who are employed at the premises at which the la-
39 bor dispute occurs and who are participating in or directly inter-
40 ested in the dispute.
41 (b) For purposes of this section, "labor dispute" means a controversy
42 with respect to wages, hours, working conditions, or right of represen-
43 tation affecting the work or employment of a number of individuals em-
44 ployed for hire that results in a deadlock or impasse between the con-
45 tending parties.
46 (c) A claimant may not be denied benefits because of a labor dispute
47 if the dispute is not in any way directly connected with the factory,
48 establishment, or premises at which the individual is or was last em-
49 ployed.

51
1 (d) A claimant's unemployment shall be deemed to be due to lack of work
2 and not due to a labor dispute if it is shown that because of the labor
3 dispute the employer's business has fallen off to the extent that the
4 employer can no longer utilize the services of the claimant due to the
5 drop in business.
6 (e) A claimant laid off because of lack of work from an employer where a
7 labor dispute later occurred shall not be considered unemployed due to
8 the labor dispute.
9 (f) The period of ineligibility under this section applies for the
10 whole of any week in which any part of a claimant's unemployment is due
11 to a labor dispute.
12 (g) The act of picketing the work site of a labor dispute constitutes
13 participation in the labor dispute, whether or not payment is made for
14 such services.
15 (h) Voluntary refusal to cross a peaceable picket line to work consti-
16 tutes participation in a labor dispute.
17 (i) Subsequent employment does not make the claimant eligible for ben-
18 efits if his unemployment is still due to the labor dispute. As long as
19 the claimant intends to return to the employer where the labor dispute
20 exists, his unemployment shall be considered due to the labor dispute
21 regardless of any intervening employment.
22 (j) The period of ineligibility due to the labor dispute terminates at
23 the end of the calendar week in which the labor dispute no longer exists.
24 The termination of the dispute does not automatically make a claimant
25 eligible for benefits.
26 (k) The fact that an individual is a dues-paying union member alone does
27 not constitute financing a labor dispute, and the fact that he is not a
28 union member does not establish that he is not financing or participat-
29 ing in the dispute.
30 (11) A claimant shall not be entitled to benefits for any week with re-
31 spect to which or a part of which he has received or is seeking benefits un-
32 der an unemployment insurance law of another state or of the United States;
33 provided, that if the appropriate agency of such other state or of the United
34 States shall finally determine that he is not entitled to such unemployment
35 compensation or insurance benefits, he shall not by the provisions of this
36 subsection be denied benefits. For purposes of this section, a law of the
37 United States providing any payments of any type and in any amounts for pe-
38 riods of unemployment due to involuntary unemployment shall be considered an
39 unemployment insurance law of the United States.
40 (12) A claimant shall not be entitled to benefits for a period of
41 fifty-two (52) weeks if it is determined that he has willfully made a false
42 statement or willfully failed to report a material fact in order to obtain
43 benefits. The period of disqualification shall commence the week the deter-
44 mination is issued. The claimant shall also be ineligible for waiting week
45 credit and shall repay any sums received for any week for which the claimant
46 received waiting week credit or benefits as a result of having willfully
47 made a false statement or willfully failed to report a material fact. The
48 claimant shall also be ineligible for waiting week credit or benefits for any
49 week in which he owes the department an overpayment, civil penalty, or inter-

52
1 est resulting from a determination that he willfully made a false statement
2 or willfully failed to report a material fact.
3 (13) A claimant shall not be entitled to benefits if his principal oc-
4 cupation is self-employment. A claimant who performs incidental work in
5 self-employment shall show that self-employment does not interfere with his
6 availability for suitable work and that he continues to seek suitable work.
7 (14) A claimant who has been found ineligible for benefits under the
8 provisions of subsection (5), (6), (7) or (9) of this section shall reestab-
9 lish his eligibility by having obtained bona fide work and received wages
10 therefor in an amount of at least fourteen (14) times his weekly benefit
11 amount.
12 (15) Benefits based on service in employment defined in sections
13 72-1349A and 72-1352(3), Idaho Code, shall be payable in the same amount, on
14 the same terms and subject to the same conditions as benefits payable on the
15 basis of other service subject to this act.
16 (a) If the services performed during one-half (1/2) or more of any con-
17 tract period by an individual for an educational institution as defined
18 in section 72-1322B, Idaho Code, are in an instructional, research, or
19 principal administrative capacity, all the services shall be deemed to
20 be in such capacity.
21 (b) If the services performed during less than one-half (1/2) of any
22 contract period by an individual for an educational institution are in
23 an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity, none
24 of the services shall be deemed to be in such capacity.
25 (c) As used in this section, "contract period" means the entire period
26 for which the individual contracts to perform services, pursuant to the
27 terms of the contract.
28 (16) No claimant is eligible to receive benefits in two (2) successive
29 benefit years unless, after the beginning of the first benefit year during
30 which he received benefits, he performed service and earned an amount equal
31 to no less than six (6) times the weekly benefit amount established during
32 the first benefit year.
33 (17)(a) Benefits based on wages earned for services performed in an
34 instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an
35 educational institution shall not be paid for any week of unemployment
36 commencing during the period between two (2) successive academic years,
37 or during a similar period between two (2) terms whether or not succes-
38 sive, or during a period of paid sabbatical leave provided for in the
39 individual's contract, to any individual who performs such services in
40 the first academic year (or term) and has a contract to perform services
41 in any such capacity for any educational institution in the second aca-
42 demic year or term or has been given reasonable assurance that such a
43 contract will be offered.
44 (b) Benefits based on wages earned for services performed in any other
45 capacity for an educational institution shall not be paid to any indi-
46 vidual for any week that commences during a period between two (2) suc-
47 cessive school years or terms if the individual performs such services
48 in the first school year or term and there is a contract or reasonable
49 assurance that the individual will perform such services in the second
50 school year or term. If benefits are denied to any individual under this

53
1 paragraph and the individual was not offered an opportunity to perform
2 such services for the educational institution for the second academic
3 year or term, the individual shall be entitled to a retroactive payment
4 of benefits for each week for which the individual filed a timely claim
5 for benefits and for which benefits were denied solely by reason of this
6 paragraph.
7 (c) With respect to any services described in paragraphs (a) and (b)
8 of this subsection, benefits shall not be paid nor waiting week credit
9 given to an individual for wages earned for services for any week that
10 commences during an established and customary vacation period or holi-
11 day recess if the individual performed the services in the period imme-
12 diately before the vacation period or holiday recess and there is a rea-
13 sonable assurance the individual will perform such services in the pe-
14 riod immediately following such vacation period or holiday recess.
15 (d) With respect to any services described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
16 this subsection, benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services
17 in any capacities specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this sub-
18 section to any individual who performed such services in an educational
19 institution while in the employ of an educational service agency. For
20 purposes of this paragraph, the term "educational service agency" means
21 a governmental entity that is established and operated exclusively for
22 the purpose of providing such services to one (1) or more educational
23 institutions.
24 (e) "Reasonable assurance" of continuing employment exists when an ed-
25 ucational institution or service agency provides a written statement to
26 the department confirming that the claimant has been given a bona fide
27 offer of a specific job in the second academic period and explaining the
28 circumstances of the offer. In addition, for such reasonable assurance
29 to exist, the terms and conditions of the job offered in the second pe-
30 riod must not be substantially less favorable than the terms and condi-
31 tions of the job performed in the first period.
32 (f) A claimant who initially was determined not to have a reasonable
33 assurance of continuing employment shall subsequently become disquali-
34 fied for benefits under this section when an educational institution or
35 service agency gives the claimant such reasonable assurance.

37 of this subsection must make a request for the retroactive payment with
38 the department no later than thirty (30) days after the beginning of the
39 second school year or term or retroactive payment will not be made.
40 (h) Employees of educational institutions hired under contract for the
41 school term are considered unemployed between school terms even though
42 they may receive their salary in twelve (12) monthly payments.
43 (18)(a) Benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services that
44 substantially consist of participating in sports or athletic events or
45 training or preparing to participate for any week that commences during
46 the period between two (2) successive sport seasons (or similar peri-
47 ods) if the individual performed services in the first season (or simi-
48 lar period) and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will
49 perform such services in the later of such seasons (or similar period).

54
1 (b) No base period wages shall be used to establish a claim when sub-
2 stantially all services performed during the base period consist of
3 participation in sports, athletic events, training, or preparing to so
4 participate, for any week that commences during the period between two
5 (2) successive sport seasons or similar periods if the individual per-
6 formed such services in the first season or similar period and there is a
7 reasonable assurance that the individual will perform such services in
8 the later of such seasons or similar periods.
9 (c) For purposes of this subsection, "reasonable assurance" does not
10 exist unless:
11 (i) The claimant has a contract, either written or oral;
12 (ii) The claimant offered to work and the employer expressed an
13 interest in hiring the player for the next season or similar pe-
14 riod; or
15 (iii) The claimant expresses a readiness and willingness or in-
16 tent to participate in the sport the following season or similar
17 period.
18 (d) Reasonable assurance exists if the claimant intends to pursue em-
19 ployment as a professional athlete the next season despite not having a
20 specific employer to return to or a formal offer of employment.
21 (e) An individual is deemed to have performed "substantially all ser-
22 vices" in sports, athletic events, training, or preparing to so partic-
23 ipate if ninety percent (90%) or more of the base period wages were based
24 on such services.
25 (19)(a) Benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services performed
26 by an alien unless the alien was lawfully admitted for permanent resi-
27 dence at the time such services were performed, was lawfully present for
28 purposes of performing such services, or was permanently residing in
29 the United States under color of law at the time the services were per-
30 formed (including an alien who was lawfully present in the United States
31 as a result of the application of the provisions of sections 207 and 208
32 or section 212(d)(5) of the immigration and nationality act).
33 (b) Any data or information required of individuals applying for bene-
34 fits to determine eligibility under this subsection shall be uniformly
35 required from all applicants for benefits.
36 (c) A decision to deny benefits under this subsection must be based on a
37 preponderance of the evidence.
38 (20) An individual who has been determined to be likely to exhaust regu-
39 lar benefits and to need reemployment services pursuant to a profiling sys-
40 tem established by the director must participate in those reemployment ser-
41 vices, unless:
42 (a) The individual has completed such services; or
43 (b) There is justifiable cause, as determined by the director, for the
44 claimant's failure to participate in such services.
45 (21)(a) A claimant:
46 (i) Who has been assigned to work for one (1) or more customers of
47 a staffing service; and
48 (ii) Who, at the time of hire by the staffing service, signed a
49 written notice informing him that completion or termination of an

55
1 assignment for a customer would not, of itself, terminate the em-
2 ployment relationship with the staffing service;
3 will not be considered unemployed upon completion or termination of an
4 assignment until such time as he contacts the staffing service to deter-
5 mine if further suitable work is available. If the claimant:
6 1. Contacts the staffing service and refuses a suitable work
7 assignment that is offered to him at that time, he will be
8 considered to have voluntarily quit that employment; or
9 2. Contacts the staffing service and the service does not
10 have a suitable work assignment for him, he will be consid-
11 ered unemployed due to a lack of work; or
12 3. Accepts new employment without first contacting the
13 staffing service for additional work, he will be considered
14 to have voluntarily quit employment with the staffing ser-
15 vice.
16 (b) For the purposes of this subsection, the term "staffing service"
17 means any person who assigns individuals to work for its customers and
18 includes but is not limited to professional employers as defined in
19 chapter 24, title 44, Idaho Code, and the employers of temporary employ-
20 ees as defined in section 44-2403(7), Idaho Code.
21 (22)(a) A claimant who is otherwise eligible for regular benefits as
22 defined in section 72-1367A(1)(e), Idaho Code, shall be eligible for
23 training extension benefits if the department determines that all of
24 the following criteria are met:
25 (i) The claimant is unemployed;
26 (ii) The claimant has exhausted all rights to regular unem-
27 ployment benefits as defined in section 72-1367A(1)(e), Idaho
28 Code, and all rights to extended benefits as defined in section
29 72-1367A(1)(f), Idaho Code, and all rights to benefits under sec-
30 tion 2002 (increase in unemployment compensation benefits) of
31 division B, title II, the assistance for unemployed workers and
32 struggling families act, of the American recovery and reinvest-
33 ment act of 2009, P.L. 111-5, as enacted on February 17, 2009;
34 (iii) The claimant is enrolled in a training program approved by
35 the department or in a job training program authorized under the
36 workforce innovation and opportunity act; except that the train-
37 ing program must prepare the claimant for entry into a high-demand
38 occupation if the department determines that the claimant sepa-
39 rated from a declining occupation or has been involuntarily and
40 indefinitely separated from employment as a result of a permanent
41 reduction of operations at the claimant's place of employment.
42 For the purposes of this subsection, a "declining occupation"
43 is one where there is a lack of sufficient current demand in the
44 claimant's labor market area for the occupational skills for which
45 the claimant is qualified by training and experience or current
46 physical or mental capacity and the lack of employment opportuni-
47 ties is expected to continue for an extended period of time, or the
48 claimant's occupation is one for which there is a seasonal vari-
49 ation in demand in the labor market and the claimant has no other
50 skills for which there is current demand. For the purposes of this

56
1 subsection, a "high-demand occupation" is an occupation in a labor
2 market area where work opportunities are available and qualified
3 applicants are lacking as determined by the use of available labor
4 market information;
5 (iv) The claimant is making satisfactory progress to complete the
6 training as determined by the department; and
7 (v) The claimant is not receiving similar stipends or other train-
8 ing allowances for nontraining costs. For the purposes of this
9 subsection, "similar stipend" means an amount provided under a
10 program with similar aims, such as providing training to increase
11 employability, and in approximately the same amounts.
12 (b) The weekly training extension benefit amount shall equal the
13 claimant's weekly benefit amount for the most recent benefit year less
14 any deductible income as determined by the provisions of this chapter.
15 The total amount of training extension benefits payable to a claimant
16 shall be equal to twenty-six (26) times the claimant's average weekly
17 benefit amount for the most recent benefit year. A claimant who is
18 receiving training extension benefits shall not be denied training ex-
19 tension benefits due to the application of subsections (4)(a)(i) and
20 (6) of this section, and an employer's account shall not be charged for
21 training extension benefits paid to the claimant.
22 SECTION 29. That Section 72-1367, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
23 amended to read as follows:
24 72-1367. BENEFIT FORMULA. (1) To be eligible an individual shall have
25 the minimum qualifying amount of wages in covered employment in at least one
26 (1) calendar quarter of his base period, and shall have total base period
27 wages of at least one and one-quarter (1 1/4) times his high quarter wages.
28 The minimum qualifying amount of wages shall be determined each January 1 and
29 shall equal fifty percent (50%) of the product of the state minimum wage, as
30 defined by section 44-1502, Idaho Code, multiplied by five hundred twenty
31 (520) hours, rounded to the lowest multiple of twenty-six (26).
32 (2) The weekly benefit amount shall be one twenty-sixth (1/26) of high-
33 est quarter wages except that it shall not exceed the applicable maximum
34 weekly benefit amount. The maximum weekly benefit amount shall be estab-
35 lished by the director, who shall determine the state average weekly wage
36 paid by covered employers for the preceding calendar year and the maximum
37 weekly benefit amount to be effective for new claims filed in the first full
38 week of the following January and filed thereafter until a new maximum weekly
39 benefit amount becomes effective under this subsection. The average weekly
40 wage shall be computed by dividing the total wages paid in covered employ-
41 ment, including state government and cost reimbursement employers, for the
42 preceding calendar year, as computed from data reported to the department
43 by covered employers, by the monthly average number of workers in covered
44 employment for the preceding calendar year and then dividing the result-
45 ing figure by fifty-two (52). The maximum weekly benefit amount shall be
46 fifty-five percent (55%) of the state average weekly wage paid by covered
47 employers for the preceding calendar year.
48 (3) Any eligible individual shall be entitled during any benefit year
49 to a total amount of benefits equal to his weekly benefit amount times the

57
1 number of full weeks of benefit entitlement appearing in the following table
2 based on his ratio of total base period earnings to highest quarter base pe-
3 riod earnings. The maximum weeks of entitlement are based on a sliding scale
4 of the official forecasted, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the
5 state for a minimum of ten (10) weeks to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks
6 depending on the unemployment rate in effect for the months of February, May,
7 August and November as follows:
8 (a) For any benefit week commencing in January through March of a calen-
9 dar year, the maximum allowed number of benefit weeks shall be based on
10 the unemployment rate for the preceding month of November;
11 (b) For any benefit week commencing in April through June of a calendar
12 year, the maximum allowed number of benefit weeks shall be based on the
13 unemployment rate for the preceding month of February;
14 (c) For any benefit week commencing in July through September of a cal-
15 endar year, the maximum allowed number of benefit weeks shall be based
16 on the unemployment rate for the preceding month of May; and
17 (d) For any benefit week commencing in October through December of a
18 calendar year, the maximum allowed number of benefit weeks shall be
19 based on the unemployment rate for the preceding month of August.

1 (4) If the total wages payable to an individual for less than full-time
2 work performed in a week claimed exceed one-half (1/2) of his weekly benefit
3 amount, the amount of wages that exceed one-half (1/2) of the weekly benefit
4 amount shall be deducted from the benefits payable to the claimant. For pur-
5 poses of this subsection, severance pay shall be deemed wages, even if the
6 claimant was required to sign a release of claims as a condition of receiving
7 the pay from the employer. "Severance pay" means a payment or payments made
8 to a claimant by an employer as a result of the severance of the employment
9 relationship.
10 (5) Benefits payable to an individual shall be rounded to the next lower
11 full dollar amount.

29 one and one-half (1 1/2) times his high quarter wages, or has earned
30 wages for services performed for covered employers during his base pe-
31 riod equal to at least forty (40) times his most recent weekly benefit
32 amount.
33 (d)(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, payment of
34 extended benefits under this chapter shall not be made to any indi-

38 fails to apply for any suitable work to which he was re-
39 ferred; or
40 2. During which he fails to actively engage in seeking work.
41 (ii) If any individual is ineligible for extended benefits for any
42 week by reason of a failure described in subsection (3)(d)(i)1. or
43 (3)(d)(i)2. of this section, the individual shall be ineligible
44 to receive extended benefits for any week which begins during a pe-
45 riod which:
46 1. Begins with the week following the week in which such
47 failure occurs; and
48 2. Does not end until such individual has been employed dur-
49 ing at least four (4) weeks which begin after such failure
50 and the total of the remuneration earned by the individual

63
1 for being so employed is not less than the product of four
2 (4) multiplied by the individual's average weekly benefit
3 amount. Remuneration earned must be in employment where an
4 employee-employer relationship exists to satisfy requali-
5 fication requirements for extended benefits.
6 (iii) Extended benefits shall not be denied under subsection
7 (3)(d)(i)1. of this section to any individual for any week by rea-
8 son of a failure to accept an offer of, or apply for, suitable work:

19 2. If the position was not offered to such individual in
20 writing or was not listed with the department;
21 3. If such failure would not result in a denial of benefits
22 under the provisions of this chapter to the extent that such
23 provisions are not inconsistent with the provisions of sub-
24 sections (1)(j) and (3)(d)(iv) of this section; or
25 4. If the position pays wages less than the higher of:
26 (A) The minimum wage provided by section 6(a)(1) of the
27 fair labor standards act of 1938, without regard to any
28 exemption; or
29 (B) Any applicable state or local minimum wage.
30 (iv) For purposes of this paragraph, an individual shall be
31 treated as actively engaged in seeking work during any week if:
32 1. The individual has engaged in a systematic and sustained
33 effort to obtain work during such week; and
34 2. The individual provides tangible evidence to the depart-
35 ment that he has engaged in such an effort during such week.
36 (v) For purposes of this section only, the department shall re-
37 fer applicants for extended benefits to any suitable work to which
38 paragraphs 1., 2., 3. and 4. of subsection (3)(d)(iii) of this
39 section would not apply.
40 (4)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, payment
41 of extended benefits shall not be made to any individual for any week if:
42 (i) Extended benefits would, but for this subsection have been
43 payable for such week pursuant to an interstate claim filed in any
44 state under the interstate benefit payment plan; and
45 (ii) An extended benefit period is not in effect for such week in
46 such state.
47 (b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to the
48 first two (2) weeks for which extended benefits are payable, determined
49 without regard to this subsection, pursuant to an interstate claim

64
1 filed under the interstate benefit payment plan to the individual from
2 the extended benefits account established for the benefit year.
3 (c) Section 3304 (a)(9)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 shall
4 not apply to any denial of benefits required under this subsection.
5 (5) Weekly extended benefit amount. The weekly extended benefit amount
6 payable to an individual for a week of total unemployment in his eligibility
7 period shall be an amount equal to the weekly benefit amount payable to him
8 during his applicable benefit year.
9 (6)(a) Total extended benefit amount. The total extended benefit
10 amount payable to an eligible individual with respect to his applicable
11 benefit year shall be the least of the following amounts:
12 (i) Fifty percent (50%) of the total amount of regular benefits
13 which were payable to him under this chapter in his applicable ben-
14 efit year;
15 (ii) Thirteen (13) times his weekly benefit amount which was
16 payable to him under this chapter for a week of total unemployment
17 in the applicable benefit year;
18 (iii) Provided that the amount so determined shall be reduced by
19 the total amount of extended benefits paid, or being paid, to the
20 individual for weeks of extended unemployment in the individual's
21 benefit year which began prior to the effective date of the fed-
22 eral-state extended benefit period which is current in the week
23 for which the individual first claims such benefits.
24 (iv) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, if the
25 benefit year of any individual ends within an extended benefit pe-
26 riod, the remaining balance of extended benefits that such indi-
27 vidual would, but for the provisions of this section, be entitled
28 to receive in that extended benefit period, with respect to weeks
29 of unemployment beginning after the end of the benefit year, shall
30 be reduced, but not below zero (0), by the product of the number of
31 weeks for which the individual received any amounts as trade read-
32 justment allowances within that benefit year, multiplied by the
33 individual's weekly benefit amount for extended benefits.
34 (b)(i) Effective with respect to weeks beginning in a high unem-
35 ployment period, subsection (6)(a) of this section shall be ap-
36 plied by substituting:
37 1. "Eighty percent (80%)" for "fifty percent (50%)" in sub-
38 section (6)(a)(i) of this section; and
39 2. "Twenty (20)" for "thirteen (13)" in subsection
40 (6)(a)(ii) of this section.
41 (ii) For purposes of subsection (6)(b)(i) of this section, the
42 term "high unemployment period" means any period during which
43 an extended benefit period would be in effect if subsection
44 (1)(b)(ii) were applied by substituting "eight percent (8%)"
45 in subsection (1)(b)(ii)1. for "six and five-tenths percent
46 (6.5%)."
47 (7)(a) Beginning and termination of extended benefit period. Whenever
48 an extended benefit period is to become effective in this state as a re-
49 sult of a state "on" indicator, or an extended benefit period is to be

65
1 terminated in this state as a result of a state "off" indicator, the di-
2 rector shall make a public announcement.
3 (b) Computations required by the provisions of subsection (1)(d) of
4 this section shall be made by the director, in accordance with regula-
5 tions prescribed by the United States secretary of labor.
6 (8) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, none of the
7 benefits paid pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be charged to
8 an employer's account for purposes of experience rating.
9 (9) Whenever a program of unemployment benefits becomes available that
10 is financed entirely by the federal government, and such program will not
11 allow payments to individuals who are entitled to extended benefits pur-
12 suant to this section, the governor may, by executive order, trigger off an
13 extended benefit period as defined in subsection (1)(a) of this section in
14 order to provide payment of such federal benefits to individuals who have
15 exhausted their right to regular benefits. When the federal benefits are
16 exhausted, or if the director determines that payment of extended benefits
17 would be more economically advantageous to the state of Idaho, the governor
18 shall, by executive order, trigger extended benefits on if the criteria of
19 subsection (1)(b) of this section are otherwise met.
20 (10) Until conformity with the federal-state extended unemployment
21 compensation act of 1970 requires otherwise, the eligibility requirements
22 in subsections (1)(j) and (3)(d) of this section are suspended. Except
23 where inconsistent with the provisions of this section, the eligibility re-
24 quirements of section 72-1366, Idaho Code, applicable to claims for regular
25 benefits shall apply in lieu of the suspended provisions.
26 SECTION 31. That Section 72-1368, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
27 amended to read as follows:
28 72-1368. CLAIMS FOR BENEFITS -- APPELLATE PROCEDURE -- LIMITATION OF
29 ACTIONS. (1) Claims for benefits shall be made in accordance with this chap-
30 ter and such rules as the director may prescribe.
31 (2) Each employer shall post and maintain in places readily accessi-
32 ble to individuals performing services for him printed statements concern-
33 ing benefit rights under this chapter which shall be provided by the depart-
34 ment without cost to the employer.
35 (3)(a) Following the filing of a claim pursuant to subsection (1) of
36 this section the department shall:
37 (i) Verify the claimant's monetary eligibility pursuant to the
38 requirements of section 72-1367, Idaho Code, and issue a determi-
39 nation. If monetarily eligible, the department shall establish
40 the date the claimant's benefit year begins, the weekly benefit
41 amount, the total benefit amount, the base period wages, and the
42 base period covered employers.
43 (ii) If a claimant is monetarily eligible, the department shall
44 verify, based on information provided by the claimant, whether the
45 week claimed is a compensable week as defined in section 72-1312,
46 Idaho Code. To receive benefits, a claimant must certify that each
47 week claimed is a compensable week. In the event the week claimed
48 is not a compensable week, the department shall issue a determina-

66
1 tion denying benefits and shall include the reasons for the ineli-
2 gibility.
3 (b) If the department has reason to believe at any time within five
4 (5) years from the week ending date for any week in which benefits were
5 paid that a claimant was not eligible for benefits, the department may
6 investigate the claim and on the basis of facts found issue a determina-
7 tion denying or allowing benefits for the week(s) in question. If the
8 department determines a claimant was not entitled to benefits received,
9 the department shall issue a determination requiring repayment of the
10 overpaid benefits, and assess any applicable penalties and interest.
11 The determination shall contain provisions advising of the right to
12 appeal the decision to the department within fourteen (14) days of the
13 date of service.
14 (c) Before a determination provided for in subsection (3) of this sec-
15 tion becomes final or an appeal is filed, the department, on its own
16 motion, may issue a revised determination. The determination or re-
17 vised determination shall become final unless, within fourteen (14)
18 days after notice, as provided in subsection (5) of this section, an
19 appeal is filed by an interested party with the department. The appeal
20 notice must be in writing, signed by an interested party, the appellant
21 or representative, and contain words that, by fair interpretation, re-
22 quest the appeal process for a specific determination or other decision
23 of the department. If an appeal is delivered personally, the personal
24 delivery date will be noted on the appeal and deemed the date of filing.
25 A faxed or electronically transmitted appeal shall be deemed filed on
26 the date received by the department, mountain time, or, if received on a
27 weekend or holiday, the next business day. If mailed, the appeal shall
28 be deemed filed on the date of mailing as determined by the postmark on
29 the envelope containing the appeal. Where it appears any appeal to the
30 appeals examiner, claim, or any other request or application was not
31 filed within the time period prescribed for filing, it shall be dis-
32 missed on such grounds.
33 (d) If a party establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that, be-
34 cause of delay or error by the United States postal service or because
35 of error on the part of the department, a determination was not deliv-
36 ered to the party's last known address, or transmitted electronically
37 in a manner approved by the department, within fourteen (14) days of the
38 date of mailing or service indicated on the determination, the period
39 for filing a timely appeal extends to fourteen (14) days from the date of
40 actual notice.
41 (4)(a) Upon appeal of a determination or revised determination, the di-
42 rector shall transfer the appeal directly to an appeals examiner pur-
43 suant to subsection (6) of this section, unless the director finds, in
44 his sole discretion, that a redetermination should be issued affirming,
45 reversing or modifying the determination or revised determination. The
46 redetermination shall become final unless, within fourteen (14) days
47 after notice as provided in subsection (5) of this section, an appeal is
48 filed by an interested party with the department in accordance with the
49 department's rules.

67
1 (b) The director may, in his sole discretion, make a special redeter-
2 mination whenever he finds that a departmental error has occurred in
3 connection with a determination, revised determination or redetermi-
4 nation that has become final, or that additional wages of the claimant
5 or other facts pertinent to such final determination, revised deter-
6 mination or redetermination have become available or have been newly
7 discovered, or that benefits have been allowed or denied or the amount
8 of benefits fixed on the basis of nondisclosure or misrepresentation of
9 fact. The special redetermination must be made within one (1) year from
10 the date the determination, revised determination or redetermination
11 became final, except that a special redetermination involving a find-
12 ing that benefits have been allowed or denied or the amount of benefits
13 fixed on the basis of nondisclosures or misrepresentations of fact may
14 be made within two (2) years from the date the determination, revised
15 determination or redetermination became final.
16 (5) All interested parties shall be entitled to prompt service of no-
17 tice of written or digital communications from the department providing
18 notice of an administrative or other deadline including, but not limited
19 to, determinations, revised determinations, redeterminations, special
20 redeterminations, decisions and letters from the department requiring a
21 response within a specified time. Notice shall be deemed served if deliv-
22 ered to the person being served, if mailed to his last known address or if
23 electronically transmitted to him at his request and with the department's
24 approval. Service by mail shall be deemed complete on the date of mailing.
25 Service by electronic transmission shall be deemed complete on the date no-
26 tice is electronically transmitted.
27 (6) To hear and decide appeals from determinations, revised determina-
28 tions, redeterminations, and special redeterminations, the director shall
29 appoint appeals examiners. Unless the appeal is withdrawn, the appeals ex-
30 aminer shall affirm, modify, set aside or reverse the determination, revised
31 determination, redetermination, or special redetermination involved, after
32 affording the interested parties reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing,
33 or may refer a matter back to the department for further action. The appeals
34 examiner shall notify the interested parties of his decision by serving no-
35 tice in the same manner as provided in subsection (5) of this section. The
36 decision shall set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law and contain
37 provisions advising of the right to appeal the decision within fourteen (14)
38 days of the date of service. The appeals examiner may, either upon applica-
39 tion for rehearing by an interested party or on his own motion, rehear, af-
40 firm, modify, set aside or reverse any prior decision on the basis of the evi-
41 dence previously submitted or on the basis of additional evidence; provided,
42 that such application or motion be made within ten (10) days after the date of
43 service of the decision. A complete record shall be kept of all proceedings
44 in connection with an appealed claim. All testimony at any hearing shall be
45 recorded. If a claim for review of the appeals examiner's decision is filed
46 with the commission, the testimony shall be transcribed if ordered by the
47 commission. Witnesses subpoenaed by the appeals examiner shall be allowed
48 fees at a rate prescribed by the director. If any interested party to a hear-
49 ing formally requests the appeals examiner to issue a subpoena for a witness
50 whose evidence is deemed necessary, the appeals examiner shall promptly is-

68
1 sue the subpoena, unless such request is determined to be unreasonable. Un-
2 less an interested party shall within fourteen (14) days after service of the
3 decision of the appeals examiner file with the commission a claim for review
4 or unless an application or motion is made for a rehearing of such decision,
5 the decision of the appeals examiner shall become final.
6 (7) The commission shall decide all claims for review filed by any in-
7 terested party in accordance with its own rules of procedure not in conflict
8 herewith. The record before the commission shall consist of the record of
9 proceedings before the appeals examiner, unless it appears to the commission
10 that the interests of justice require that the interested parties be permit-
11 ted to present additional evidence. In that event, the commission may, in
12 its sole discretion, conduct a hearing or may remand the matter back to the
13 appeals examiner for an additional hearing and decision. On the basis of the
14 record of proceedings before the appeals examiner as well as additional ev-
15 idence, if allowed, the commission shall affirm, reverse, modify, set aside
16 or revise the decision of the appeals examiner or may refer the matter back to
17 the appeals examiner for further proceedings. The commission shall file its
18 decision and shall promptly serve notice of its decision to all interested
19 parties. A decision of the commission shall be final and conclusive as to all
20 matters adjudicated by the commission upon filing the decision in the office
21 of the commission; provided, within twenty (20) days from the date of filing
22 the decision, any party may move for reconsideration of the decision or the
23 commission may rehear or reconsider its decision on its own initiative. The
24 decision shall be final upon denial of a motion for rehearing or reconsidera-
25 tion or the filing of the decision on reconsideration.
26 (8) No person acting on behalf of the director or any member of the com-
27 mission shall participate in any case in which he has a direct or indirect
28 personal interest.
29 (9) An appeal may be made to the Supreme Court from decisions and orders
30 of the commission within the times and in the manner prescribed by rule of the
31 Supreme Court.
32 (10)(a) Benefits shall be paid promptly in accordance with any decision
33 allowing benefits, regardless of:
34 (i) The pendency of a time period for filing an appeal or peti-
35 tioning for commission review; or
36 (ii) The pendency of an appeal or petition for review.
37 (b) Such payments shall not be withheld until a subsequent appeals ex-
38 aminer decision or commission decision modifies or reverses the previ-
39 ous decision, in which event benefits shall be paid or denied in accor-
40 dance with such decision.
41 (11)(a) Any right, fact, or matter in issue, directly based upon or nec-
42 essarily involved in a determination, redetermination, decision of the
43 appeals examiner or decision of the commission which has become final,
44 shall be conclusive for all the purposes of this chapter as between the
45 interested parties who had notice of such determination, redetermina-
46 tion or decision. Subject to appeal proceedings and judicial review by
47 the Supreme Court as set forth in this section, any determination, rede-
48 termination or decision as to rights to benefits shall be conclusive for
49 all purposes of this chapter and shall not be subject to collateral at-
50 tack irrespective of notice.

69
1 (b) No finding of fact or conclusion of law contained in a decision or
2 determination rendered pursuant to this chapter by an appeals examiner,
3 the industrial commission, a court, or any other person authorized to
4 make such determinations shall have preclusive effect in any other ac-
5 tion or proceeding, except proceedings that are brought (i) pursuant
6 to this chapter, (ii) to collect unemployment insurance contributions,
7 (iii) to recover overpayments of unemployment insurance benefits, or
8 (iv) to challenge the constitutionality of provisions of this chapter
9 or administrative proceedings under this chapter.
10 (12) The provisions of the Idaho administrative procedure act, chapter
11 52, title 67, Idaho Code, regarding contested cases and judicial review of
12 contested cases are inapplicable to proceedings involving claimants under
13 the provisions of this chapter.
14 SECTION 32. That Section 72-1374, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
15 amended to read as follows:

17 lowing persons, in violation of the provisions of chapter 1, title 74,
18 Idaho Code, or section 72-1342, Idaho Code, or rules or department policies
19 promulgated thereunder, or the material terms of any confidentiality and
20 nondisclosure agreement, makes any unauthorized disclosure of employment
21 security information, each act of unauthorized disclosure shall constitute
22 a separate misdemeanor:
23 (1) Any employee of the department;
24 (2) Any employee or member of the commission;
25 (3) Any third party or employee thereof who has obtained employment se-
26 curity information pertaining to a person with the written, informed consent
27 of that person;
28 (4) Any public official who has obtained employment security informa-
29 tion for use in the performance of official duties; or
30 (5) Any person who has obtained employment security information

35 72-1346A. ADVANCES UNDER TITLE XII OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT TO EM-
36 PLOYMENT SECURITY FUND -- FEDERAL ADVANCE INTEREST REPAYMENT FUND. (1) In
37 the event the director determines that it is necessary to obtain advances
38 from the federal unemployment account in the unemployment trust fund pur-
39 suant to title XII of the social security act (42 U.S.C. 1321), and that a
40 request for such advances is authorized under section 1201 of the social se-
41 curity act, or under any other act of congress extending such authority, the
42 director shall request the governor to make application to the secretary of
43 labor of the United States for such advances.
44 (2) The governor is authorized to make application to the secretary of
45 labor of the United States to obtain advances pursuant to title XII of the
46 social security act (42 U.S.C. 1321 et seq.). Funds so advanced shall be for
47 the payment of unemployment insurance benefits.

70
1 (3) Any amount transferred to the employment security fund by the sec-
2 retary of the treasury of the United States in accordance with this section
3 shall be repaid from the employment security fund as provided in section 1202
4 of the social security act (42 U.S.C. 1322).
5 (4) There is established in the state treasury the "Federal Advance In-
6 terest Repayment Fund." This fund shall consist of all moneys collected pur-
7 suant to subsection (5) of this section and interest earned upon any moneys
8 in the fund. All moneys in the fund are perpetually appropriated to the di-
9 rector for the payment of interest on any advance made to this state pursuant
10 to title XII of the social security act, except that if, at the end of any cal-
11 endar year, all advances and interest have been repaid, any remaining bal-
12 ance in the fund shall be transferred to the employment security fund. In-
13 terest charges due and payable pursuant to section 1202 of the social secu-
14 rity act, may be paid by the director from the federal advance interest re-
15 payment fund. Such expenditures shall not be subject to any law requiring
16 specific appropriations or other formal release by state officers of money
17 in their custody, nor shall such expenditures require the approval of the
18 board of examiners.
19 (5) A federal advance interest repayment tax may be levied in accor-
20 dance with the following provisions when required under paragraph (b) of
21 this subsection:
22 (a) On the first day of the third month of a calendar quarter, the direc-
23 tor shall:
24 (i) Estimate the interest payable on federal advances obtained
25 under subsections (1) and (2) of this section;
26 (ii) Estimate the amount of federal advance interest repayment
27 tax receipts expected to be collected during the quarter for any
28 preceding calendar quarter in which such tax was assessed;
29 (iii) Add the amount in the federal advance interest repayment
30 fund on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter
31 to the estimate in paragraph (ii) of this subsection; and
32 (iv) Subtract the sum obtained in paragraph (iii) from the esti-
33 mate in paragraph (i) of this subsection.
34 (b) If the remainder obtained under paragraph (iv) of subsection (5)(a)
35 of this section is more than zero, each covered employer subject to this
36 section may, at the director's sole discretion, be assessed a federal
37 advance interest repayment tax. Such tax shall be a percentage of the
38 contributions payable under sections 72-1349 and 72-1350, Idaho Code,
39 for the calendar quarter, but in no case shall be less than one dollar
40 ($1.00). The percentage shall be determined by dividing the remainder
41 in paragraph (iv) of subsection (5)(a) of this section by the estimated
42 amount of contributions due and payable on wages paid during the quar-
43 ter. The percentage shall be rounded up to the next one-tenth of a per-
44 cent (0.1%).
45 (c) The tax assessed shall be collected and paid in accordance with such
46 rules as the director may prescribe. All such taxes collected shall be
47 deposited in the federal advance interest repayment fund. Any such tax
48 imposed in a calendar quarter shall be paid on or before the last day of
49 the second month following the close of such calendar quarter. An ex-

71
1 tension of time for payment may be granted for good cause in accordance
2 with section 72-1349(4)(6), Idaho Code.
3 (d) If any covered employer fails to pay such tax on or before the date
4 on which they are due, such tax shall bear penalty at a rate of five dol-
5 lars ($5.00) for each month or fraction thereof until paid; provided,
6 that in no case shall the penalty exceed the actual amount of the tax
7 due and payable. The date of payment shall be deemed the date of ac-
8 tual receipt by the director, or if mailed, the date of mailing. Penal-
9 ties collected pursuant to this subsection shall be paid into the fed-
10 eral advance interest payment fund. Furthermore, if any employer be-
11 comes delinquent in making payment of the tax as required by this sub-
12 section, such employer shall be subject to the collection provisions in
13 sections 72-1355 and 72-1360, Idaho Code.
14 (e) A covered employer may make application to the director for a re-
15 fund or credit of any amount erroneously paid as tax under this subsec-
16 tion. Such applications and the director's determinations regarding
17 them shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 72-1357,
18 Idaho Code.
19 (f) This section does not apply to covered employers eligible and
20 electing the cost reimbursement payment method under section 72-1349A,

25 assessed by the director:
26 (a) If a determination is made finding that an employer willfully filed
27 a false report, a monetary penalty equal to one hundred percent (100%)
28 of the amount that would be due if the employer had filed a correct re-
29 port or two hundred fifty dollars ($250), whichever is greater, shall
30 be added to the liability of the employer for each quarter for which the
31 employer willfully filed a false report. For the purposes of this sec-

39 port when due, the director shall assess a monetary penalty equal to:
40 (i) Seventy-five dollars ($75.00) or twenty-five percent (25%)
41 of the amount that would be due if the employer had filed a timely
42 quarterly report, whichever is greater, if the employer had not
43 been found in any previous determination to have willfully failed
44 to file a timely quarterly report for any of the sixteen (16) pre-
45 ceding consecutive calendar quarters; or
46 (ii) One hundred fifty dollars ($150) or fifty percent (50%) of
47 the amount that would be due if the employer had filed a timely
48 quarterly report, whichever is greater, if the employer had been
49 found in any previous determination to have willfully failed to

72
1 file a timely quarterly report for no more than one (1) of the six-
2 teen (16) preceding consecutive calendar quarters; or
3 (iii) Two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or one hundred percent
4 (100%) of the amount that would be due if the employer had filed a
5 timely quarterly report, whichever is greater, if the employer had
6 been found in any previous determination or determinations to have
7 willfully failed to file a timely quarterly report for two (2) or
8 more of the sixteen (16) preceding consecutive calendar quarters.
9 (c) If a determination is made finding that an employer, or any offi-
10 cer or agent or employee of the employer with the employer's knowledge,
11 willfully made a false statement or representation or willfully failed
12 to report a material fact when submitting facts to the department
13 concerning a claimant's separation from the employer, a penalty in
14 an amount equal to ten (10) times the weekly benefit amount of such
15 claimant shall be added to the liability of the employer.
16 (d) If a determination is made finding that an employer has induced, so-
17 licited, coerced or colluded with an employee or former employee to file
18 a false or fraudulent claim for benefits under this chapter, a penalty
19 in an amount equal to ten (10) times the weekly benefit amount of such
20 employee or former employee shall be added to the liability of the em-
21 ployer.
22 (e) If a determination is made finding that an employer failed to com-
23 plete and submit an Idaho business registration form when due, as re-
24 quired by section 72-1337(1), Idaho Code, a penalty of five hundred dol-
25 lars ($500) shall be assessed against the employer.
26 (f) For purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this subsection, the term
27 "weekly benefit amount" means the amount determined by the director
28 pursuant to section 72-1367(2), Idaho Code.
29 (g) If a determination is made finding that a person has made any unau-
30 thorized disclosure of employment security information in violation of
31 the provisions of chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, or section 72-1342,
32 Idaho Code, or rules promulgated thereunder, a penalty of five hundred
33 dollars ($500) for each act of unauthorized disclosure shall be as-
34 sessed against the person.
35 (h) If a determination is made finding that a professional employer
36 failed to submit a separate quarterly wage report for each client as re-
37 quired in section 72-1349B(4)(9), Idaho Code, the director shall assess
38 a monetary penalty equal to one hundred dollars ($100) for each client
39 not separately reported by the professional employer; provided that the
40 maximum penalty for any quarter shall not exceed five thousand dollars
41 ($5,000).
42 (2) At the discretion of the director, the department may waive all or
43 any part of the penalties imposed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section
44 if the employer shows to the satisfaction of the director that it had good
45 cause for failing to comply with the requirements of this chapter and rules
46 promulgated thereunder.
47 (3) Determinations imposing civil penalties pursuant to this section
48 shall be served in accordance with section 72-1368(5), Idaho Code. Penal-
49 ties imposed pursuant to this section shall be due and payable twenty (20)
50 days after the date the determination was served unless an appeal is filed

73
1 in accordance with section 72-1368, Idaho Code, and rules promulgated there-
2 under. Such appeals shall be conducted in accordance with section 72-1368,
3 Idaho Code, and rules promulgated thereunder.
4 (4) Civil penalties imposed by this section shall be in addition to any
5 other penalties authorized by this chapter. The provisions of this chap-
6 ter that apply to the collection of contributions, and the rules promulgated
7 thereunder, shall also apply to the collection of penalties imposed pursuant
8 to this section. Amounts collected pursuant to this section shall be paid
9 into the state employment security administrative and reimbursement fund as
