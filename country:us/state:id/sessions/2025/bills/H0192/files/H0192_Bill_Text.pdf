10 that may be taken under authority of the several types of tags and permits
11 provided for in this title and the manner in which said tags and permits shall
12 be used and validated. All Idaho wolf tags will be valid for hunting, trap-
13 ping, and snaring in any unit when seasons are open at the time of take. There
14 shall be no limit to the number of wolf tags that an individual can purchase.
15 All appropriate fish and game education requirements must be met.

20 tion by nonresidents in controlled hunts.
21 (3) Outfitted Hunter Tags Set-Aside. When the commission establishes a
22 limit as to the number of nonresident deer tags and nonresident elk tags, it
23 shall set aside, when setting big game seasons, in a statewide pool, a maxi-
24 mum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the nonresident tag quota as of February
25 6, 2025, of the nonresident deer tag and nonresident elk tag limit. These
26 tags may shall be allocated to the outfitted hunters in capped hunts, limited
27 hunts, and controlled hunts and set aside for outfitted hunter use in general
28 hunts.
29 (a) Such outfitted allocated set-aside tags shall be separate from the
30 tag numbers set for residents and nonresidents in each capped or con-
31 trolled hunt, unit, or game management area. The set-aside tags shall
32 be sold pursuant to commission rule the provisions of this subsection

37 tag or nonresident elk tag, that person's outfitter must submit an ap-
38 plication with the proper fees as required by the director. If any non-
39 resident deer tags or nonresident elk tags set aside for use in general
40 hunts pursuant to this subsection are unsold by July 15 of the year in
41 which they were set aside, they may be sold by the department to the gen-
42 eral public pursuant to commission rule. If any nonresident deer tags

2

2 pursuant to this subsection are unsold by July 31 of the year in which
3 they were set aside, they may be sold by the department to the general
4 public pursuant to commission rule.
5 The commission may promulgate all necessary rules to implement the pro-
6 visions of this subsection.
7 (4) Deer and Elk Tag Allocation. When setting big game seasons, if the
8 commission limits the number of deer or elk tags available for use in any game
9 management area, unit, or zone, the commission may shall allocate by rule,
10 where there are outfitted operations, a number of deer and elk tags from the
11 outfitted hunter set-aside pool of tags for use by hunters any type of hunter
12 that have has entered into a signed agreement for that year to utilize the
13 services of an outfitter licensed pursuant to chapter 21, title 36, Idaho
14 Code.

16 including the capped elk zones, using historic use of the highest tag
17 number from the previous two (2) years, prior to implementing the draw.
18 (b) Outfitter allocation in general season hunts, including limited
19 hunts and capped elk zones, shall be recalculated every two (2) years

26 hunter elk and deer tags based on the highest number within each of the
27 last two (2) years of all elk or deer tags using the services of an out-
28 fitter in each capped general season hunt. Any additional tags above
29 the original outfitted hunter tag quota may shall come from the nonres-
30 ident outfitted hunter set-aside pool or the nonresident quota in the
31 capped hunt, not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the nonresident quota
32 for each capped hunt. In capped hunts, when tag numbers change for all
33 users, they or when a new hunt is created, such changes will apply pro-
34 portionally to all user groups.

36 fitted hunter elk or deer tags based on a number compiled from each out-
37 fitter's highest year within the last two (2) years of all elk or deer
38 tags using the services of an outfitter for each controlled hunt. Any
39 additional tags above the original outfitted hunter tag quota may come
40 from the nonresident outfitted hunter set-aside pool or the nonresident
41 quota in the controlled hunt, not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
42 nonresident quota for each controlled hunt.

6 by outfitters with the department by December 20 each year. An admin-
7 istrative fee of five dollars ($5.00) shall be assessed for each allo-
