14 district to vote in that district's election.

16 a declaration of intent as a write-in candidate, it appears that the num-
17 ber of qualified candidates who have been nominated is equal to the number
18 of supervisors to be elected, it shall not be necessary for the candidates to
19 stand for election. The board of supervisors shall declare such candidates
20 elected as supervisors, and the soil and water conservation district shall
21 immediately make and deliver to such persons certificates of election.

47 efits or health care benefits.

33 given in such manner as the commissioners may order, which time, however,

37 vide for a control program in such district and create the necessary machin-
38 ery to carry out such program unless a petition of protest has been filed with
39 the clerk of the board of commissioners. Said petition of protest shall meet
40 the same requirements as to the number of signers and for the same number of
41 precincts and for the same district boundaries as petitions in favor previ-
42 ously filed and shall be filed with the clerk of the board of commissioners
43 not later than fourteen (14) days following said hearing.

47 for the purpose of determining whether or not a control district shall be
48 created. The cost of conducting the election shall be paid from any county

12 scribed in section 50-2005, Idaho Code.
13 (b) An urban renewal agency created after July 1, 2011, shall not trans-
14 act any business or exercise its powers provided for in this chapter
15 until a majority of qualified electors, voting in a citywide or coun-
16 tywide election, depending on the municipality in which such agency is
17 created, vote to authorize such agency to transact business and exer-
18 cise its powers provided for in this chapter. If prior to July 1, 2011,
19 the local governing body has made the findings prescribed in paragraph
20 (a) of this subsection, then such agency shall transact business and
21 shall exercise its powers hereunder and is not subject to the require-
22 ments of this paragraph.
23 (2) Upon satisfaction of the requirements under subsection (1) of this
24 section, the urban renewal agency is authorized to transact the business and

26 as follows:
27 (a) Unless provided otherwise in this section, the mayor, by and with
28 the advice and consent of the local governing body, shall appoint a
29 board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency, which shall consist
30 of not less than three (3) commissioners nor more than nine (9) commis-
31 sioners. In the order of appointment, the mayor shall designate the
32 number of commissioners to be appointed, and the term of each, provided

34 shall expire in the same year. The commissioners shall serve for terms
35 not to exceed five (5) years, from the date of appointment, except that
36 all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term.
37 (b) For inefficiency or neglect of duty or misconduct in office, a com-
38 missioner may be removed by a majority vote of the local governing body
39 only after a hearing and after he shall have been given a copy of the
40 charges at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing and have had an op-
41 portunity to be heard in person or by counsel. Any commission position
42 that becomes vacant at a time other than the expiration of a term shall

44 that is the local governing body, by and with the advice and consent of
45 the local governing body, including the mayor, if applicable, and shall

2 renewal agency of the members of the local governing body on and after

4 and immunities vested by the urban renewal law of 1965, and as amended,
5 in an appointed board of commissioners, shall be vested in the local
6 governing body, which shall, in all respects when acting as an urban re-
7 newal agency, be acting as an arm of state government, entirely separate
8 and distinct from the municipality, to achieve, perform, and accomplish
9 the public purposes prescribed and provided by said urban renewal law of
10 1965, and as amended.
11 (d) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may termi-
12 nate the appointed board of commissioners and thereby appoint and des-
13 ignate itself as the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency
14 for not more than one (1) calendar year.
15 (e) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may provide
16 that the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency shall be
17 elected at an election held for such purpose on one (1) of the November
18 dates provided in section 34-106, Idaho Code, and the ordinance may pro-
19 vide term limits for the commissioners. In this case, all the rights,
20 powers, duties, privileges, and immunities vested by the urban renewal
21 law of 1965, and as amended, in an appointed board of commissioners,
22 shall be vested in the elected board of commissioners of the urban

33 erning body, by and with the advice and consent of the local governing

48 commissioners thereof. A majority of the commissioners shall consti-
49 tute a quorum for the purpose of conducting business and exercising the
50 powers of the agency and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by

1 the agency upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, un-
2 less in any case the bylaws shall require a larger number.
3 (b) The commissioners shall elect the chairman, cochairman, or vice
4 chairman for a term of one (1) year from among their members. An agency
5 may employ an executive director, technical experts, and such other
6 agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and
7 determine their qualifications, duties, and compensation. For such
8 legal service as it may require, an agency may employ or retain its own
9 counsel and legal staff.
10 (c) An agency authorized to transact business and exercise powers un-
11 der this chapter shall file, with the local governing body, on or be-

20 available for inspection during business hours in the office of the city
21 clerk or county recorder, in the office of the agency, and at all times
22 on the website of the state controller.
23 (d) An urban renewal agency shall have the same fiscal year as a mu-
24 nicipality and shall be subject to the same audit requirements as a mu-
25 nicipality. An urban renewal agency shall be required to prepare and
26 file with its local governing body an annual financial report and shall
27 prepare, approve, and adopt an annual budget for filing with the local
28 governing body, for informational purposes. A budget means an annual
29 estimate of revenues and expenses for the following fiscal year of the
30 agency.

32 pursuant to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, open meetings law pursuant to
33 chapter 2, title 74, Idaho Code, the ethics in government law pursuant to
34 chapter 4, title 74, Idaho Code, and the competitive bidding provisions of
