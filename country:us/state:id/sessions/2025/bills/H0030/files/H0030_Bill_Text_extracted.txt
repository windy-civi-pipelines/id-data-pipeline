11 tions from state agencies with particular expertise. All agencies of the
12 state of Idaho shall cooperate with the board by providing requested exist-
13 ing information and studies pertaining in any manner to any matters which are
14 the subject of this act. The board shall have discretion to balance all fac-

24 tent with the comprehensive state water plan. These duties include but are

27 the authority of any state agency with respect to activities not prohibited
28 by the comprehensive state water plan. The designation of a waterway as a
29 natural or recreation river shall not preclude the department of health and
30 welfare environmental quality from establishing water quality standards for
31 such waterway.

33 shall be filed in the office of the governor and director of the department of
34 water resources, and published and distributed generally.

41 provided in section 7, article XV, of the constitution of the state of Idaho.

47 prising Part B of the comprehensive state water plan, upon the adoption of a
48 concurrent resolution of the legislature directing the review or requesting
49 a specific amendment to the plan. The board also may undertake the review in
16
1 response to a petition for amendment filed pursuant to subsection (3) of this
2 section, or upon the board's own initiative, as determined necessary by the
3 board. Amendments to Part A or Part B of the comprehensive state water plan
4 shall be adopted in the same manner as the original plan.

6 part of the comprehensive state water plan until approved by law. If the

10 bition or terms and conditions imposed on such protected river pursuant to
11 subsection (5) or (6) of section 42-1734A, Idaho Code, shall be terminated
12 ten (10) days following the end of the session. The failure to approve a pro-
13 tected river shall not operate to invalidate a comprehensive plan or com-
14 ponent thereof. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the legislature,
15 however, from approving such protected river and reinstituting or modifying
16 such prohibitions or terms and conditions in a subsequent session.
17 (10) After adoption of a comprehensive plan or component thereof, the
18 board shall administer the implementation of the plan.

2 INSIGHT INTEGRATED DATA SYSTEM ACT
3 67-4801. SHORT TITLE. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as
4 the "Insight Integrated Data Systems Act."
5 67-4802. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. The local governments, state agencies
6 and departments, and volunteer nongovernmental entities that comprise and
7 interact with the criminal justice and behavioral health systems in Idaho
8 possess a wealth of data. A centralized data repository to manage and link
9 data across separate entities will aid in evaluating the effectiveness of
10 the criminal justice and behavioral health systems and enable data-driven,
11 cost-saving decision-making on issues facing the criminal justice and
12 behavioral health systems in Idaho. This chapter establishes the legal
13 framework by which the various contributing entities may share, integrate,
14 merge, observe, examine, and research siloed data in a way that protects
15 sensitive or legally protected personal information.
16 67-4803. INSIGHT INTEGRATED DATA SYSTEM. (1) There is hereby created
17 in the office of the state controller the insight integrated data system to
18 receive, store, secure, and maintain data and information from local govern-
19 ments, state agencies and departments, and volunteer nongovernmental enti-
20 ties.
21 (2) The office of the state controller, as the managing agency of the
22 data system, may:
23 (a) Require contributing local governments, state agencies and depart-
24 ments, and volunteer nongovernmental entities to deliver data and in-
25 formation in a certain format and on schedules established for the data
26 system; and
27 (b) Enter into or adopt a memorandum of understanding with each con-
28 tributing local government, state agency and department, and volunteer
29 nongovernmental entity, and such memorandum must identify the confi-
30 dentiality of the information and any conditions or restrictions on the
31 use of the data or information.
32 (3) No memorandum of understanding with a contributing volunteer non-
33 governmental entity shall:
34 (a) Give such volunteer nongovernmental entity priority in determin-
35 ing the use of the data system or compel the data system to produce any
36 project, report, data analysis, or other similar work product for or on
37 behalf of any contributing volunteer nongovernmental entity; or
38 (b) Waive or otherwise inhibit a contributing volunteer nongovernmen-
39 tal entity's option to discontinue further contribution of data or in-
40 formation to the data system at any time.
41 (4) The records and data collected and stored by the data system shall
42 be exempt from disclosure as set forth in section 74-105(19), Idaho Code.
43 The confidentiality of all records and data collected by the data system
44 shall comply with applicable state and federal laws governing the privacy of
45 records, data, and personal identifiable information.

3
1 67-4804. DATA OVERSIGHT COUNCIL. (1) There is hereby created in the
2 office of the state controller the data oversight council. All requests for
3 projects, reports, data analyses, or other similar work product generated
4 from the data system must be approved by the data oversight council.
5 (2) The data oversight council shall be comprised of:
6 (a) The governor or his designee;
7 (b) The chief justice of the Idaho supreme court or his designee;
8 (c) The attorney general or his designee;
9 (d) The state controller or his designee;
10 (e) The director of the department of correction or his designee;
11 (f) The executive director of the commission of pardons and parole or
12 his designee;
13 (g) The director of the department of juvenile corrections or his de-
14 signee;
15 (h) The director of the department of health and welfare or his de-
16 signee;
17 (i) The director of the Idaho state police or his designee;
18 (j) The administrator of the office of information technology services
19 or his designee;
20 (k) A designee from the state board of education or the state department
21 of education selected by the governor; and
22 (l) Any other director of a state agency not listed above that enters
23 into a memorandum of understanding to share data or information under
24 this chapter, or a designee of such director.
25 (3) Any designee under subsection (2) of this section must be an em-
26 ployee in the office, agency, or department of his respective designating
27 authority. Members of the data oversight council shall serve without any ad-
28 ditional compensation or honorarium.
29 (4) The data oversight council, by majority vote, shall elect a chair
30 and vice chair from among its members who shall serve a term of two (2) years
31 while serving on the council.
32 (5) All meetings of the data oversight council shall be held in com-
33 pliance with the open meetings law as provided in chapter 2, title 74, Idaho
34 Code.
35 (6) The state controller shall work in collaboration with the data
36 oversight council to manage the data system. It shall be the duty of the
37 state controller, in conjunction with the data oversight council, to assure
38 confidentiality of all records and data collected by the data system and to
39 assure compliance with applicable state and federal laws and rules governing
40 the privacy of records, data, and personal identifiable information.
41 (7) Any projects, reports, data analyses, or other similar work product
42 in final form produced by persons authorized to conduct research and analy-
43 ses under this chapter shall belong to the requesting local government or
44 state agency or department and not the office of the state controller.
45 (8) The Idaho legislature, as well as the contributing state agencies
46 and departments and local governments, shall have priority in requesting any
47 projects, reports, data analyses, or other similar work product to be pro-
48 duced by persons authorized by the data oversight council. The data over-
49 sight council may, in its discretion, deny any requested project, report,

4
1 data analysis, or other similar work product where it determines the request
2 is unduly burdensome, voluminous, or cost-prohibitive.
3 (9) The office of the state controller, members of the data oversight
4 council, and all contributing local governments, state agencies and depart-
5 ments, and volunteer nongovernmental entities shall be immune from liabil-
6 ity to any person or entity for any invasion of the right to privacy or use of
7 records or data generated by the data system.
8 (10) In collaboration with contributing local governments, state agen-
9 cies and departments, and volunteer nongovernmental entities and the data
10 oversight council, the state controller may establish policies addressing
11 the creation of reports generated through the query of records and data pos-
12 sessed by the data system. Provided, however, contributing volunteer non-
13 governmental entities may collaborate only with respect to the data or in-
14 formation contributed by such volunteer nongovernmental entity.
15 SECTION 3. That Section 20-503, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby

22 (2) The department shall be under the control and supervision of a di-
23 rector, who shall be appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent
24 of the senate. The director shall exercise all of the powers and duties nec-
25 essary to carry out the proper administration of the department and may dele-
26 gate duties to employees and officers of the department. The director shall
27 have the authority to employ an attorney or attorneys to provide legal ser-
28 vices to the department and such managers, assistants, clerical staff and
29 other employees necessary to the proper functioning and administration of
30 the department.
31 (3) The department of juvenile corrections shall be composed of such

9 pation, and assistance of state agencies. The board also shall solicit eco-
10 nomic, energy, environmental, and other technical studies and recommenda-
11 tions from state agencies with particular expertise. All agencies of the
12 state of Idaho shall cooperate with the board by providing requested exist-
13 ing information and studies pertaining in any manner to any matters which are
14 the subject of this act. The board shall have discretion to balance all fac-
15 tors relevant to the formulation, adoption and implementation of the compre-

17 rivers.
18 (3) Any state agency may petition the board to amend the comprehensive
19 state water plan. The board shall review any petition filed pursuant to this

21 tion to amend the comprehensive plan or set forth its reasons for denying the
22 request in writing.

24 tent with the comprehensive state water plan. These duties include but are
25 not limited to the issuance of permits, licenses, and certifications; pro-

27 the authority of any state agency with respect to activities not prohibited
28 by the comprehensive state water plan. The designation of a waterway as a
29 natural or recreation river shall not preclude the department of health and
30 welfare environmental quality from establishing water quality standards for
31 such waterway.

33 shall be filed in the office of the governor and director of the department of
34 water resources, and published and distributed generally.
35 (6) The comprehensive state water plan and any component thereof devel-

38 immediately following the board's adoption of the comprehensive state water
39 plan or component thereof.

41 provided in section 7, article XV, of the constitution of the state of Idaho.

47 prising Part B of the comprehensive state water plan, upon the adoption of a
48 concurrent resolution of the legislature directing the review or requesting
49 a specific amendment to the plan. The board also may undertake the review in

16
1 response to a petition for amendment filed pursuant to subsection (3) of this
2 section, or upon the board's own initiative, as determined necessary by the
3 board. Amendments to Part A or Part B of the comprehensive state water plan
4 shall be adopted in the same manner as the original plan.
5 (9) A protected river designated by the board shall not become a final
6 part of the comprehensive state water plan until approved by law. If the
7 legislature does not approve a protected river by law at the regular ses-
8 sion immediately following the board's designation of such protected river,
9 then the designation of such protected river shall terminate and any prohi-
10 bition or terms and conditions imposed on such protected river pursuant to
11 subsection (5) or (6) of section 42-1734A, Idaho Code, shall be terminated
12 ten (10) days following the end of the session. The failure to approve a pro-
13 tected river shall not operate to invalidate a comprehensive plan or com-
14 ponent thereof. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the legislature,
15 however, from approving such protected river and reinstituting or modifying
16 such prohibitions or terms and conditions in a subsequent session.
17 (10) After adoption of a comprehensive plan or component thereof, the
18 board shall administer the implementation of the plan.

16 63-1309. SPECIAL TAXING DISTRICT OR BOND PROPOSAL DEFEATED IN ELEC-
17 TION BARS SUBSEQUENT ELECTIONS FOR SPECIFIED TIME -- EXCEPTION -- BOARD OF
18 EDUCATION MAY CONDUCT ELECTION -- MUNICIPALITIES, WATER OR SEWER DISTRICTS
19 MAY CONDUCT BOND ELECTION. If any election has been held for the formation of
20 any special taxing district, or for the approval of any bond issue or other
21 proposal which that would have resulted in a property tax levy, and the pro-
22 posal submitted at such election was defeated, no subsequent election shall
23 be held within two (2) months from and after the date of such prior election
24 for the same or a similar purpose in any district which that includes any
25 part of the area which that was affected by the prior election. In the event
26 any school building is destroyed or rendered unusable for school purposes by
27 reason of fire, flood or other catastrophe, and a school bond election for
28 the purpose of the replacement of such building is prohibited by the provi-
29 sions of this section or by the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, the
30 state board of education shall have the power to authorize an election for
31 such purpose by order based upon a finding of such facts. The provisions of
32 this section shall not apply to school elections held solely for determining
33 property tax levies for general school purposes not involving the issuance
34 of bonds. This time requirement between elections shall not apply to munici-
35 palities or water and/or sewer districts when bond issues are being proposed
36 for the installation or improvement of water supply systems or public sewer-
37 age systems which that have been deemed necessary by the Idaho state board of
38 health and welfare department of environmental quality to bring such system
39 or systems in conformance with state statutes or rules of the state board of
40 health and welfare.
41 SECTION 21. That Section 74-105, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby

36 he or she is a named party if such documents are not otherwise prohibited from
37 disclosure by federal law or regulation or state law. The confidentiality of

17 sion, including medical and rehabilitation records, are otherwise ex-
