10 path for determining if a student has met the state civics and government
11 content standards. Alternate paths are open to all students in grades 7
12 through 12. Any student who has been determined proficient in the state
13 civics and government content standards through the completion of the civics

31 to be transcribed and may elect to not have the grade and credits transferred
32 to the student's high school transcript. Courses taken in middle school
33 appearing in the student's high school transcript pursuant to this section
34 shall count for the purpose of high school graduation. However, the student
35 shall complete the required number of credits in all high school core sub-
36 jects as identified in section 33-6802, Idaho Code. The transcribing high
37 school is required to verify that the course meets the requirements speci-
