4 Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:

17 college football's top running back. He was also runner-up for the Heisman
18 Memorial Trophy in the closest vote since 2009. He rushed for 2,601 yards,
19 falling short by only 27 yards of matching the all-time National Collegiate
20 Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision record for
21 the most yards rushed in a single season record, which was set in 1988 by
22 Barry Sanders. Jeanty was also named a first team All-American by the Asso-
23 ciated Press, the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writ-

25 Foundation. He was the first Boise State Bronco football player to ever be
26 named a unanimous All-American, as recognized by the NCAA; and
27 WHEREAS, the team's offensive lineman, Kage Casey, joined Ashton Jeanty
28 in being named an All-American. He was selected to the All-America Second
29 Team by the Walter Camp Football Foundation; and
30 WHEREAS, the team's head coach, Spencer Danielson, in his first full
31 season as the team's head coach, was named the Mountain West Conference Coach
32 of the Year after leading the team to 12 wins, 11 of which were in the regular
33 football season, with a perfect home-game record of 7-0. He also led the team
34 to its second conference championship in his time as the head coach. As the
35 interim head coach in 2023, he lead the team to the Mountain West Conference
36 football championship; and
37 WHEREAS, Boise State Athletics and Bronco Nation sold out all seven home
38 games at Albertsons Stadium in 2024, which included the Mountain West Con-
39 ference football championship game. In one of those home games, the largest
40 ever reported crowd of 37,711 fans watched the team defeat Washington State
41 University with a score of 45-24. The Boise State Broncos football team set a
42 program record for total season attendance of 259,801 and season average at-
43 tendance of 37,114.
