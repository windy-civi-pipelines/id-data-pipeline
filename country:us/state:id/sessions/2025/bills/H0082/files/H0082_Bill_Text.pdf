10 that have experienced depredation of livestock by grizzly bear and wolves.
11 (2) The Idaho state department of agriculture, in consultation with the
12 department of fish and game and the office of species conservation, is au-
13 thorized to carry out the purposes of this section and has spending authority
14 for compensation pursuant to this section to the extent of legislative ap-

16 tablished in the state treasury. All expenditures from the fund will be paid
17 according to rules promulgated by the Idaho state department of agriculture.

19 appropriate two hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($225,000) annually to
20 the fund. One hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) of that amount shall
21 be used annually to compensate validated confirmed claims for depredation,
22 and seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) of that amount shall be used an-
23 nually for conflict prevention and the provision of information regarding
24 deterrents that have proven effective as determined pursuant to rule as pro-
25 mulgated by the Idaho state department of agriculture. All claims shall be
26 made to the office of species conservation on or before December 31 of each
27 year. Validated Confirmed claims for depredation shall be paid on a pro rata
28 basis in the event moneys in the fund are insufficient to pay all validated
29 confirmed claims in full, until such time as moneys in the fund are depleted.
30 Any moneys in the fund after payment of validated confirmed claims shall then
31 be paid to those livestock owners with probable claims for depredation on a
32 pro rata basis in the event moneys in the fund are insufficient to pay all
33 probable claims in full, until such moneys in the fund are depleted. Any mon-
34 eys in the fund after payment of claims deemed probable shall then be paid
35 to those livestock owners with claims reviewed and deemed possible on a pro
36 rata basis in the event moneys in the fund are insufficient to pay all pos-
37 sible claims in full, until such moneys in the fund are depleted. Any mon-
38 eys in the fund after probable possible depredation claims are paid shall be
39 carried over to the next calendar year. Interest accruing on moneys in the
40 fund shall be retained in the fund. Moneys shall be continuously appropri-
41 ated to the fund, but the fund shall not exceed four hundred thousand dollars
42 ($400,000).

4 owner for depredation shall be deducted from the fair market value prior to
5 payment.

7 goat, swine, poultry, bees, llamas, or equine animals used for food or in the
8 production of food, fiber, feed, or other agriculture-based consumer prod-
