6 his constitutional rights under the fourth amendment to the constitution of
7 the United States and section 17, article I of the constitution of the state

36 a part thereof, unless the commission, in its discretion, shall determine
37 otherwise, but nothing herein contained shall prevent the commission from
38 again paroling such prisoners at its discretion.

40 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
