1 A JOINT MEMORIAL
2 TO THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES IN CON-
3 GRESS ASSEMBLED AND TO THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION REPRESENTING THE
4 STATE OF IDAHO IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES.
5 We, your Memorialists, the House of Representatives and the Senate of
6 the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Sixty-eighth
7 Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that:
8 WHEREAS, the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) of 1980 authorizes the
9 award of attorney's fees and other expenses to certain individuals, small
10 businesses, and other entities that prevail against the federal government
11 in judicial proceedings and adversary adjudications before federal agencies
12 when the government's position is not substantially justified; and
13 WHEREAS, the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recre-
14 ation Act of 2019 established a requirement that the Administrative Confer-
15 ence of the United States make annual reports to Congress and to maintain
16 a searchable online database containing information about each fee award
17 under the EAJA, including the amount, the recipient, and the basis for the
18 finding that the government's position was not substantially justified; and
19 WHEREAS, in fiscal year 2023, federal agencies reported paying
20 $115,476,482.59 in awards of attorney's fees and other expenses under the
21 EAJA; and
22 WHEREAS, in fiscal year 2023, the United States Department of the Inte-
23 rior reported 19 awards totaling $2,868,732.63 and the Environmental Pro-
24 tection Agency reported six awards totaling $1,408,792.88; and
25 WHEREAS, the Supreme Court has held that a party need not prevail on all
26 of its claims, or even on the central issue in the case, but only on any sig-
27 nificant issue in litigation that achieved some of the benefit the parties
28 sought in bringing the suit; and
29 WHEREAS, the EAJA has been inappropriately used to appropriate taxpayer
30 dollars to fund litigation aimed at preventing development and/or resource
31 extraction; and
32 WHEREAS, Idaho citizens' whose livelihoods depend on successfully and
33 efficiently executing agreements and completing development on land within
34 the state of Idaho are harmed when litigation concerning natural resources
35 stalls their ability to work.
36 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
37 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and
38 the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature respectfully requests
39 federal intervention with legislation to amend the EAJA so that moneys may
40 only be awarded pursuant thereto if a party prevails on its central issue in
41 matters involving environmental or natural resource issues.
42 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chief Clerk of the House of Representa-
43 tives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this

1 Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Repre-
2 sentatives of Congress and to the congressional delegation representing the
