25 state accepts an offender from another state under any interstate com-
26 pact or under any other reciprocal agreement with any county, state,

50 fender is to be discharged from the facility, whichever is earlier.

7
1 (8) The collection facility and sex offender registration location
2 shall verify that the person's DNA sample has been collected in Idaho. The
3 collection facility shall not be required to collect a DNA sample if it can be
4 verified that a sample already exists for the person in the Idaho DNA data-
5 base.
