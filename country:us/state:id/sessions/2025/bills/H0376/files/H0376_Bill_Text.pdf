12 sheriff must forward the applicant's completed license application and fin-
13 gerprints to the Idaho state police. The Idaho state police must conduct a
14 national fingerprint-based records check, an inquiry through the national
15 instant criminal background check system and a check of any applicable state
16 database, including a check for any mental health records for conditions or
17 commitments that would disqualify a person from possessing a firearm under
18 state or federal law, and return the results to the sheriff within sixty
19 (60) days. If the applicant is not a United States citizen, an immigration
20 alien query must also be conducted through United States immigration and
21 customs enforcement or any successor agency. The sheriff shall not issue
22 a license before receiving the results of the records check and must deny a
23 license if the applicant is disqualified under any of the criteria listed
24 in subsection (11) of this section. The sheriff may deny a license to carry
25 concealed weapons to an alien if background information is not attainable or
26 verifiable.

16 39, Idaho Code, that restrains the person from harassing, stalking or
17 threatening an intimate partner of the person, or child of the intimate

19 intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or
20 child; or
21 (n) Is for any other reason ineligible to own, possess or receive a
22 firearm under the provisions of Idaho or federal law.

24 ity under subsection (11) of this section, the sheriff shall not consider:

47 a form or in a manner prescribed by the Idaho state police. Information re-
48 lating to an applicant or licensee received or maintained pursuant to this

5 fully required by any state or federal agency or department, and the actual
6 cost of materials for the license lawfully required by any state agency or
7 department, which costs must be paid to the state. The sheriff must provide
8 the applicant with a copy of the results of the fingerprint-based records
9 check upon request of the applicant.

18 or disqualified in this state shall be renewable at any time during the
19 ninety (90) day period before its expiration or within ninety (90) days after

21 prior to the expiration date of the license. The sheriff shall require the
22 licensee applying for renewal to complete an application. The sheriff must
23 submit the application to the Idaho state police for a records check of state

26 sheriff shall not issue a renewal before receiving the results of the records
27 check and must deny a license if the applicant is disqualified under any of
28 the criteria provided in this section. A renewal license shall be valid for
29 a period of five (5) years. A license so renewed shall take effect on the ex-

46 or political subdivision ask the applicant to voluntarily submit any infor-
47 mation not required in this section. A civil action may be brought to enjoin
48 a wrongful refusal to issue a license or a wrongful modification of the re-
49 quirements of this section. The civil action may be brought in the county in
50 which the application was made or in Ada county at the discretion of the peti-

7

2 courts for a violation of this section must be awarded costs, including rea-
3 sonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with the legal action.

7 compliance with this section.
8 (20) The sheriff of a county shall issue a license to carry a con-
9 cealed weapon to those individuals between the ages of eighteen (18) and
10 twenty-one (21) years who, except for the age requirement contained in sec-
11 tion 18-3302K(4), Idaho Code, would otherwise meet the requirements for
12 issuance of a license under section 18-3302K, Idaho Code. Licenses issued
13 to individuals between the ages of eighteen (18) and twenty-one (21) years
14 under this subsection shall be easily distinguishable from licenses issued
15 pursuant to subsection (7) of this section. A license issued pursuant to
16 this subsection after July 1, 2016, shall expire on the twenty-first birth-
17 day of the licensee. A licensee, upon attaining the age of twenty-one (21)
18 years, shall be allowed to renew the license under the procedure contained in
19 section 18-3302K(9), Idaho Code. Such renewal license shall be issued as an
20 enhanced license pursuant to the provisions of section 18-3302K, Idaho Code.
21 (21) A person carrying a concealed weapon in violation of the provisions
22 of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
23 (22) The sheriff of the county where the license was issued or the sher-
24 iff of the county where the person resides shall have the power to revoke a
25 license subsequent to a hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter
26 52, title 67, Idaho Code, for any of the following reasons:
27 (a) Fraud or intentional misrepresentation in the obtaining of a li-
28 cense;
29 (b) Misuse of a license, including lending or giving a license to an-
30 other person, duplicating a license or using a license with the intent
31 to unlawfully cause harm to a person or property;
32 (c) The doing of an act or existence of a condition that would have been
33 grounds for the denial of the license by the sheriff;
34 (d) The violation of any of the terms of this section; or
35 (e) The applicant is adjudicated guilty of or receives a withheld judg-
36 ment for a crime that would have disqualified him from initially receiv-
37 ing a license.
38 (23) A person twenty-one (21) years of age or older who presents a valid
39 license to carry concealed weapons is exempt from any requirement to undergo
40 a records check at the time of purchase or transfer of a firearm from a feder-
41 ally licensed firearms dealer. Provided however, a temporary emergency li-
42 cense issued pursuant to subsection (6) of this section shall not exempt the
43 holder of the license from any records check requirement.
44 (24) The attorney general must contact the appropriate officials in
45 other states for the purpose of establishing, to the extent possible, recog-
46 nition and reciprocity of the license to carry concealed weapons by other
47 states, whether by formal agreement or otherwise. The Idaho state police
48 must keep a copy and maintain a record of all such agreements and reciprocity
49 recognitions, which must be made available to the public.

8
1 (25) Nothing in subsection (3) or (4) of this section shall be construed
2 to limit the existing rights of a private property owner, private tenant,
3 private employer, or private business entity. The provisions of this sub-
4 section shall not apply to any property owned by the state of Idaho or its
5 political subdivisions that is normally and habitually open to the public.
6 Such limitation on the application of this subsection shall supersede Hern-
7 don v. City of Sandpoint, 531 P.3d 1125 (Idaho 2023).
8 (a) Such limitation on the application of this subsection shall apply
9 whether such property is leased, rented, licensed, loaned, permitted,
10 or occupied, whether for consideration or not.
11 (b) Any restriction on the carrying of concealed weapons pursuant to
12 this subsection may only be invoked for public property owned by the
13 state or its political subdivisions when the use of such property is for
14 a private event by invitation only, for a commercial event that charges
15 admission, or for any other event with restricted access whether admis-
16 sion is charged or not. For any such private event, commercial event,
17 or other event, it must appear to a reasonable person that the general
18 public does not have unrestricted access to the designated public prop-
19 erty, or any subset of such property, that is normally and habitually
20 open to the public.
21 (c) (b) Nothing in this subsection relieves any political subdivision
22 of the state of Idaho of its duties to convey or manage public property
23 in accordance with Idaho law.
24 (d) (c) Nothing in this subsection alters or amends the provisions of
25 section 18-3302C or 18-3309, Idaho Code.
26 (26) The provisions of this section are hereby declared to be severable
27 and if any provision of this section or the application of such provision to
28 any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason, such declara-
29 tion shall not affect the validity of remaining portions of this section.
30 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
31 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
32 July 1, 2025.
