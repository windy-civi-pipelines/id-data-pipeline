26 state-administered guest worker program established in this chapter is in-

43 employee with a social security number.
44 (2) To the extent feasible, the commission shall work with the applica-
45 ble federal government agencies to ensure that the withholding provided for
46 under this section is compatible with a federal process to allow for employ-

14 department shall require each guest worker applicant to provide information
15 and fingerprints necessary to obtain criminal conviction history informa-
16 tion from the Idaho state police and the federal bureau of investigation.
17 Pursuant to section 67-3008, Idaho Code, and P.L. 92-544, the department
18 shall obtain fingerprints from the applicant, which shall be submitted to
19 the Idaho state police, bureau of criminal identification, for a criminal
20 records check of state and national databases. The applicant shall submit
21 a fingerprint card for processing and pay, or have paid for him, the associ-
22 ated fees. Fingerprints and information required by this section shall be
23 submitted in a manner as prescribed by the Idaho state police.
24 (2) The department is authorized to receive criminal history informa-
25 tion from the Idaho state police and from the federal bureau of investigation
26 for the purpose of evaluating the fitness of applicants for the Idaho guest
27 worker program. As provided by state and federal law, further dissemination
28 or other use of the criminal history information is prohibited. Criminal
29 background reports received from the Idaho state police and the federal bu-
30 reau of investigation shall be handled and disposed of in a manner consistent
31 with requirements imposed by the Idaho state police and the federal bureau of
32 investigation.
33 (3) The department shall review the information received from the crim-
34 inal history and background check and determine whether the applicant for
35 the Idaho guest worker program has a criminal record that disqualifies the

37 Code.
38 44-2811. IDAHO GUEST WORKER TAX PAYMENTS. (1) The commission shall
39 establish a method for a person who receives services from an Idaho guest
40 worker to withhold from compensation paid to such guest worker an amount to
41 be determined by commission rule that, as closely as possible, equals the
42 income taxes that would be imposed by state law if the permit holder were an
43 employee with a social security number.
44 (2) To the extent feasible, the commission shall work with the applica-
45 ble federal government agencies to ensure that the withholding provided for
46 under this section is compatible with a federal process to allow for employ-
47 ment tax collection under federal law as if a permit holder were an employee
48 with a social security number.
