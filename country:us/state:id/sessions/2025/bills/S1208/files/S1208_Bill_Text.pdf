2 necessary actions to ensure that the state is not obligated to replace lost
3 federal funds. Pursuant to Section 67-1917, Idaho Code, the agency will

5 propriated to satisfy match requirements for federal funds shall be reverted

8 sion of the Legislative Services Office of any significant changes related
