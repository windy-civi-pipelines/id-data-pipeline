33 for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of ev-
34 idence from another member state shall be enforced in the latter state
35 by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and
36 procedure applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before

1 D. The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a li-
2 censee who changes home states during the course of the investigations. The
3 home state shall also have authority to take appropriate actions and shall

5 of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly no-
6 tify the new home state of any adverse actions.
7 E. A member state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover from
8 the affected licensee the costs of investigations and dispositions of cases
9 resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee.
10 F. A member state may take adverse action based on the factual findings
11 of another remote state, provided that the member state follows its own pro-
12 cedures for taking the adverse action.

15 spective state law, any member state may participate with other member
16 states in joint investigations of licensees.

18 ance materials in furtherance of any joint investigation initiated un-
19 der the compact.

21 home state license resulting in an encumbrance on the home state license,
22 the licensee's compact privilege in all other member states shall be revoked
23 until all encumbrances have been removed from the home state license. All
24 home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a licensee
25 shall include a statement that the licensee's compact privileges are revoked
26 in all member states during the pendency of the order.
27 I. Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an unen-
28 cumbered license, as certified by the home state's licensing authority, the
29 licensee must meet the requirements of section 4A. of this compact and follow
30 the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in
31 any remote state.
32 J. If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the
33 administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall

6 mittee charged with responsibility of investigation or determina-

9 member state law; or

13 cer shall state that the meeting will be closed and reference each rel-
14 evant exempting provision, and such reference shall be recorded in the
15 minutes.
16 4. The compact commission shall keep minutes that fully and clearly de-
17 scribe all matters discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and
18 accurate summary of actions taken, and the reasons therefore, includ-
19 ing a description of the views expressed. All documents considered in
20 connection with an action shall be identified in such minutes. All min-

27 ties.
28 2. The compact commission may accept any and all appropriate revenue

31 from each member state and impose fees on licensees of member states to

33 and activities of the compact commission and its staff, which must, in a
34 total amount, be sufficient to cover its annual budget as approved each
35 year for which revenue is not provided by other sources. The aggregate
36 annual assessment amount for member states shall be allocated based
37 upon a formula that the compact commission shall promulgate by rule.
38 4. The compact commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior
39 to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the compact
40 commission pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by and

42 5. The compact commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts
43 and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the compact

47 ject to an annual financial review by a certified or licensed public
48 accountant, and the report of the financial review shall be included in
49 and become part of the annual report of the compact commission.
50 H. Qualified immunity, defense, and indemnification:

13
1 1. The members, officers, executive director, employees and repre-
2 sentatives of the compact commission shall be immune from suit and
3 liability, both personally and in their official capacity, for any

6 or omission that occurred, or that the person against whom the claim is
7 made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of
8 compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided
9 that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect any such
10 person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability
11 caused by the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that per-
12 son. The procurement of insurance of any type by the compact commission
13 shall not in any way compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
14 2. The compact commission shall defend any member, officer, executive
15 director, employee, and representative of the compact commission in
16 any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any ac-
17 tual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope
18 of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or as
19 determined by the compact commission that the person against whom the
20 claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the
21 scope of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities;
22 provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person
23 from retaining their own counsel at their own expense; and provided fur-
24 ther, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result
25 from that person's intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.
26 3. The compact commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member,
27 officer, executive director, employee, and representative of the com-
28 pact commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained
29 against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or
30 omission that occurred within the scope of compact commission employ-
31 ment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such person had a reason-
32 able basis for believing occurred within the scope of compact commis-
33 sion employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual
34 or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional
35 or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
36 4. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of
37 any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be
38 governed solely by any other applicable state laws.
39 5. Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise
40 abrogate a member state's state action immunity or state action affir-
41 mative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman act,
42 Clayton act, or any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive
43 law or regulation.
44 6. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of
45 sovereign immunity by the member states or by the compact commission.
46 SECTION 9

2 nance, operation, and utilization of a coordinated data system.

4 privilege a unique identifier, as determined by the rules.
5 C. Notwithstanding any other provision of state law to the contrary, a

7 viduals to whom this compact is applicable as required by the rules of the
8 compact commission, including:
9 1. Identifying information;
10 2. Licensure data;

18 nial;

22 the compact commission.
23 D. The records and information provided to a member state pursuant to
24 this compact or through the data system, when certified by the compact com-
25 mission or an agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated business

27 hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial, or administra-
28 tive proceedings in a member state.
29 E. Current significant investigative information pertaining to a li-
30 censee in any member state will only be available to other member states.
31 F. It is the responsibility of the member states to report any adverse
32 action against a licensee and to monitor the data system to determine whether
33 any adverse action has been taken against a licensee. Adverse action infor-
34 mation pertaining to a licensee in any member state will be available to any
35 other member state.

42 SECTION 10
43 RULEMAKING
44 A. The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to
45 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and pro-
46 visions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect
47 only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid be-
48 cause the compact commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner

15
1 that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers granted
2 hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
3 B. The rules of the compact commission shall have the force of law in
4 each member state, provided however that where the rules conflict with the
5 laws or regulations of a member state that relate to the procedures, actions,
6 and processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state
7 and the circumstances under which the licensed dietitian may do so, as held
8 by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the compact commission
9 shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
10 C. The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pur-
11 suant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted there-
12 under. Rules shall become binding on the day following adoption or as of the
13 date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is later.
14 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule
15 or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same man-
16 ner used to adopt the compact within four (4) years of the date of adoption of
17 the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member
18 state.
19 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the compact
20 commission.
21 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission shall
22 hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments,
23 data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
24 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the compact commission, and
25 at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the compact com-
26 mission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the compact commis-
27 sion shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
28 1. On the website of the compact commission or other publicly accessi-
29 ble platform;
30 2. To persons who have requested notice of the compact commission's no-
31 tices of proposed rulemaking; and
32 3. In such other ways as the compact commission may by rule specify.
33 H. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
34 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the com-
35 pact commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if
36 different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the compact
37 commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
38 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or
39 other means of communication, the mechanism for access to the hearing;
40 3. The text of the proposed rule and the reason therefore;
41 4. A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested per-
42 son; and
43 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
44 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all writ-
45 ten comments and documents received by the compact commission in response to
46 the proposed rule shall be available to the public.
47 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
48 hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the compact
49 commission at hearings required by this section.

16
1 K. The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take
2 final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full
3 text of the rule.
4 1. The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule pro-
5 vided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed
6 rule.
7 2. The compact commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons
8 for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for
9 substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
10 3. The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective date
11 for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L. of
12 this section, the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than
13 thirty (30) days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the
14 rule.
15 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact commission
16 may consider and adopt an emergency rule with twenty-four (24) hours' no-
17 tice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking pro-
18 cedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively
19 applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than
20 ninety (90) days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of
21 this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in
22 order to:
23 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
24 2. Prevent a loss of compact commission or member state funds;
25 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by
26 federal law or rule; or
27 4. Protect public health and safety.
28 M. The compact commission or an authorized committee of the compact
29 commission may direct revision to a previously adopted rule for purposes of
30 correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency,
31 or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision shall be posted on
32 the website of the compact commission. The revision shall be subject to
33 challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The
34 revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a
35 material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and deliv-
36 ered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no
37 challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action.
38 If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
39 approval of the compact commission.
40 N. No member state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this
41 compact.
42 SECTION 11
43 OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
44 A. Oversight:
45 1. The executive and judicial branches of state government in each mem-
46 ber state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and
47 appropriate to implement this compact.

17
1 2. Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and
2 judicial proceedings by or against the compact commission shall be
3 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction
4 where the principal office of the compact commission is located. The
5 compact commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the
6 extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
7 resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the se-
8 lection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for
9 professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
10 3. The compact commission shall be entitled to receive service of
11 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation
12 of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding
13 for all purposes. Failure to provide the compact commission service of
14 process shall render a judgment or order void as to the compact commis-
15 sion, this compact, or promulgated rules.
16 B. Default, technical assistance, and termination:
17 1. If the compact commission determines that a member state has de-
18 faulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
19 this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall
20 provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default
21 shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default,
22 and any other action that the compact commission may take and shall of-
23 fer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
24 2. The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default
25 to the other member states.
26 C. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
27 may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of
28 the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits
29 conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective
30 date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
31 state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
32 D. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after
33 all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of in-
34 tent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the compact commission to the
35 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legis-
36 lature, the defaulting state's licensing authority, and each of the member
37 states' licensing authority.
38 E. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
39 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termi-
40 nation, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of ter-
41 mination.
42 F. Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that
43 state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state
44 of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all
45 compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six (6)
46 months after the date of said notice of termination.
47 G. The compact commission shall not bear any costs related to a state
48 that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact,
49 unless agreed upon in writing between the compact commission and the de-
50 faulting state.

18
1 H. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact commission
2 by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia
3 or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal of-
4 fices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
5 including reasonable attorney's fees.
6 I. Dispute resolution:
7 1. Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall at-
8 tempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member
9 states and between member and non-member states.
10 2. The compact commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both
11 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
12 J. Enforcement:
13 1. By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate legal
14 action against a member state in default in the United States district
15 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
16 compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with
17 the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief
18 sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event ju-
19 dicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded
20 all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
21 The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the com-
22 pact commission. The compact commission may pursue any other remedies
23 available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
24 2. A member state may initiate legal action against the compact commis-
25 sion in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or
26 the federal district where the compact commission has its principal of-
27 fices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
28 promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive re-
29 lief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the
30 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, includ-
31 ing reasonable attorney's fees.
32 3. No party other than a member state shall enforce this compact against
33 the compact commission.
34 SECTION 12
35 EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
36 A. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact
37 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.
38 1. On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact commis-
39 sion shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven
40 (7) member states (charter member states) to determine if the statute
41 enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than
42 the model compact statute.
43 a. A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materi-
44 ally different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to
45 the default process set forth in section 11 of this compact.
46 b. If any member state is later found to be in default, or is termi-
47 nated, or withdraws from the compact, the compact commission shall

19
1 remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if
2 the number of member states should be less than seven (7).
3 2. Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven (7) ini-
4 tial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in
5 section 8.C.21. to determine if their enactments are materially dif-
6 ferent from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for par-
7 ticipation in the compact.
8 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or in
9 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior
10 to the effective date of the compact or the compact commission coming
11 into existence shall be considered to be actions of the compact commis-
12 sion unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission.
13 4. Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact commis-
14 sion's initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the
15 rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes
16 law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the com-
17 pact commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day
18 the compact becomes law in that state.
19 B. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute
20 repealing the same.
21 1. A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred
22 eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing statute.
23 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the with-
24 drawing state's licensing authority to comply with the investigative
25 and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
26 effective date of withdrawal.
27 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a
28 state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all li-
29 censees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
30 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to
31 recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a
32 minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such notice of
33 withdrawal.
34 C. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
35 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between
36 a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provi-
37 sions of this compact.
38 D. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to
39 this compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until
40 it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
41 SECTION 13
42 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
43 A. This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking authority
44 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the im-
45 plementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
46 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be
47 construed to limit the compact commission's rulemaking authority solely for
48 those purposes.

20
1 B. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase,
2 clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of compe-
3 tent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, a
4 state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the
5 applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance
6 is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
7 validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to
8 any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected
9 thereby.
10 C. Notwithstanding subsection B. of this section, the compact commis-
11 sion may deny a state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with
12 the requirements of section 11.B., terminate a member state's participation
13 in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a mem-
14 ber state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this com-
15 pact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state,
16 the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member
17 states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all
18 severable matters.
19 SECTION 14
20 CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
21 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other
22 law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact.
23 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a
24 member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the
25 conflict.
26 C. All permissible agreements between the compact commission and the
27 member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
28 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
29 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
