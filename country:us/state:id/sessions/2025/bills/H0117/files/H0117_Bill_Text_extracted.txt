19 41-6703. INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM. (1) Commensurate with the
20 size and complexity of the licensee, the nature and scope of the licensee's
21 activities, including its use of third-party service providers, and the
22 sensitivity of the nonpublic information used by the licensee or in the
23 licensee's possession, custody, or control, each licensee must develop, im-
24 plement, and maintain a comprehensive written information security program
25 based on the licensee's risk assessment that contains administrative, tech-
26 nical, and physical safeguards for the protection of nonpublic information
27 and the licensee's information system.
28 (2) A licensee must require that any of its third-party service
29 providers implement appropriate administrative, technical, and physical
30 measures to protect and secure the information systems and nonpublic infor-
31 mation that are accessible to, or held by, a third-party service provider.
32 Nonpublic information is not accessible to, or held by, a third-party ser-
33 vice provider within the meaning of this section if it is encrypted and the
34 associated protective process or key necessary to assign meaning to the non-
35 public information is not within the possession of the third-party service
36 provider.
37 (3) As part of its information security program, each licensee must
38 establish a written incident response plan designed to promptly respond
39 to, and recover from, any cybersecurity event that compromises the con-
40 fidentiality, integrity, or availability of nonpublic information in its
41 possession, the licensee's information systems, or the continuing function-
42 ality of any aspect of the licensee's business or operations.
43 (4) Each licensee must maintain all records supporting its information
44 security program for a period of five (5) years. To the extent a licensee has
45 identified areas that require material improvement, the licensee must docu-
46 ment the identification and the remedial efforts planned and underway to ad-
47 dress such areas.
4
1 41-6704. INVESTIGATION OF A CYBERSECURITY EVENT. (1) If a licensee
2 learns that a cybersecurity event has or may have occurred, such licensee
3 or third-party service provider designated to act on behalf of the licensee
4 shall conduct a prompt investigation.
5 (2) During the investigation, the licensee or third-party service
6 provider designated to act on behalf of the licensee shall, to the extent
7 possible:
8 (a) Determine whether a cybersecurity event has occurred;
9 (b) Assess the nature and scope of the cybersecurity event;
10 (c) Identify any nonpublic information that may have been involved in
11 the cybersecurity event; and
12 (d) Perform or oversee reasonable measures to restore the security of
13 the information systems compromised in the cybersecurity event in order
14 to prevent further unauthorized acquisition, release, or use of nonpub-
15 lic information in the licensee's possession, custody, or control.
16 (3) If a licensee learns that a cybersecurity event has or may have oc-
17 curred that impacted the licensee's nonpublic information in a system main-
18 tained by a third-party service provider, the licensee shall complete the
19 steps provided in subsection (2) of this section or make reasonable efforts
20 to confirm and document that the third-party service provider has completed
21 such steps.
22 (4) A licensee shall maintain records concerning all cybersecurity
23 events for a period of at least five (5) years from the date of the cyberse-
24 curity event.
25 41-6705. NOTICE OF A CYBERSECURITY EVENT. (1) Each licensee must no-
26 tify the director as promptly, in the form and manner prescribed by the di-
27 rector, as reasonably practicable but not later than ten (10) business days
28 after a determination that a cybersecurity event has occurred when either:
29 (a) This state is the licensee's state of domicile, in the case of an in-
30 surer, or this state is the licensee's home state, in the case of a pro-
31 ducer, as those terms are defined in section 41-1003, Idaho Code, and
32 the cybersecurity event has a reasonable likelihood of materially harm-
33 ing:
34 (i) Any consumer residing in this state; or
35 (ii) Any material part of the normal operations of the licensee;
36 or
37 (b) The licensee reasonably believes that the nonpublic information
38 involved is of two hundred fifty (250) or more consumers residing in
39 this state and that the event is either:
40 (i) A cybersecurity event impacting the licensee of which notice
41 is required to be provided to any government body, self-regulatory
42 agency, or any other supervisory body pursuant to any state or fed-
43 eral law; or
44 (ii) A cybersecurity event that has a reasonable likelihood of ma-
45 terially harming:
46 1. Any consumer residing in this state; or
47 2. Any material part of the normal operations of the li-
48 censee.
5
1 (2) A licensee shall notify each consumer residing in this state with-
2 out unreasonable delay after a determination that a cybersecurity event has
3 occurred that is reasonably likely to result in material harm to that con-
4 sumer. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a licensee that
5 determines a cybersecurity event has occurred affecting data owned or li-
6 censed by another licensee must provide a notice to the owner or licensor of
7 the data affected by the cybersecurity event in place of the notification to
8 affected consumers.
9 (a) The licensee shall provide a copy of the notice sent to consumers to
10 the director.
11 (b) In determining whether a cybersecurity event is reasonably likely
12 to result in material harm to consumers residing in this state pursuant
13 to this subsection, a licensee shall act with the care an ordinarily
14 prudent person in like position would exercise under similar circum-
15 stances.
16 (c) A licensee may delay providing notice without violating the provi-
17 sions of this subsection if either:
18 (i) A delay is necessary in order for the licensee to take any mea-
19 sures necessary to determine the scope of the cybersecurity event
20 and restore the reasonable integrity of the information system.
21 However, the licensee must provide the notice required pursuant
22 to this section without unreasonable delay after the licensee com-
23 pletes the measures necessary to determine the scope of the cyber-
24 security event and restore the reasonable integrity of the infor-
25 mation system; or
26 (ii) A law enforcement agency determines and advises the licensee
27 that providing a notice will impede a criminal or civil investi-
28 gation or jeopardize homeland or national security. However, the
29 licensee must provide the notice required pursuant to this sec-
30 tion without unreasonable delay after the law enforcement agency
31 determines that providing the notice will no longer impede the in-
32 vestigation or jeopardize homeland or national security.
33 (3) In the case of a cybersecurity event impacting a licensee's nonpub-
34 lic information in a system maintained by a third-party service provider, of
35 which the licensee has become aware, the licensee must treat such event as
36 it would pursuant to subsection (1) of this section unless the third-party
37 service provider provides the notice required pursuant to subsection (1) of
38 this section to the director.
39 (a) The computation of the licensee's deadlines shall begin on the day
40 after the third-party service provider notifies the licensee of the cy-
41 bersecurity event or the licensee otherwise has actual knowledge of the
42 cybersecurity event, whichever is sooner.
43 (b) Nothing in this chapter prevents or abrogates an agreement between
44 a licensee and another licensee, a third-party service provider, or any
45 other party to fulfill any of the investigation requirements imposed
46 pursuant to section 41-6704, Idaho Code, or notice requirements imposed
47 pursuant to this section.
48 (4) As to notice of cybersecurity events of reinsurers to insurers:
49 (a) In the case of a cybersecurity event involving nonpublic infor-
50 mation that is used by or in the possession, custody, or control of a
6
1 licensee acting as an assuming insurer, including an assuming insurer
2 domiciled in another state or jurisdiction, and such licensee does not
3 have a direct contractual relationship with the affected consumers:
4 (i) The assuming insurer must notify its affected ceding insurers
5 and the insurance director of its state or jurisdiction of domi-
6 cile within ten (10) business days of making the determination
7 that a cybersecurity event has occurred; and
8 (ii) The ceding insurers that have a direct contractual relation-
9 ship with affected consumers must fulfill the consumer notifica-
10 tion requirements imposed pursuant to subsection (2) of this sec-
11 tion and any other notification requirements relating to a cyber-
12 security event imposed pursuant to this section.
13 (b) In the case of a cybersecurity event involving nonpublic informa-
14 tion that is in the possession, custody, or control of a third-party
15 service provider of a licensee that is an assuming insurer, including an
16 assuming insurer domiciled in another state or jurisdiction:
17 (i) The assuming insurer must notify its affected ceding insurers
18 and the insurance director of its state or jurisdiction of domi-
19 cile within ten (10) business days of receiving notice from its
20 third-party service provider that a cybersecurity event has oc-
21 curred; and
22 (ii) The ceding insurers that have a direct contractual relation-
23 ship with affected consumers must fulfill the consumer notifica-
24 tion requirements imposed pursuant to subsection (3) of this sec-
25 tion and any other notification requirements relating to a cyber-
26 security event imposed pursuant to this section.
27 (c) Any licensee acting as an assuming insurer shall not have any other
28 notice obligations relating to a cybersecurity event or other data
29 breach pursuant to this section.
30 (5) In the case of a cybersecurity event involving nonpublic infor-
31 mation that is in the possession, custody, or control of a licensee that
32 is an insurer or its third-party service provider for which a consumer ac-
33 cessed the insurer's services through an independent insurance producer,
34 and for which consumer notice is required pursuant to subsection (2) of
35 this section, the insurer must notify the producers of record of all af-
36 fected consumers of the cybersecurity event in a reasonable manner and at
37 a time reasonably concurrent with the time at which notice is provided to
38 the affected consumers. The insurer is excused from this obligation for
39 any producer or producer's representative who is not authorized by law or
40 contract to sell, solicit, or negotiate on behalf of the insurer and in those
41 instances in which the insurer does not have the current producer of record
42 information for any individual consumer.
43 41-6706. DIRECTOR'S POWER TO EXAMINE AND INVESTIGATE. (1) The direc-
44 tor shall have the power to examine and investigate the affairs of any li-
45 censee to determine whether the licensee has been or is engaged in any con-
46 duct in violation of the provisions of this chapter. This power is in ad-

16 action brought as a part of the director's duties.
17 (2) Neither the director nor any person who received documents, materi-
18 als, or other information while acting under the authority of the director is

19 41-6703. INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM. (1) Commensurate with the
20 size and complexity of the licensee, the nature and scope of the licensee's
21 activities, including its use of third-party service providers, and the
22 sensitivity of the nonpublic information used by the licensee or in the
23 licensee's possession, custody, or control, each licensee must develop, im-
24 plement, and maintain a comprehensive written information security program
25 based on the licensee's risk assessment that contains administrative, tech-
26 nical, and physical safeguards for the protection of nonpublic information
27 and the licensee's information system.
28 (2) A licensee must require that any of its third-party service
29 providers implement appropriate administrative, technical, and physical
30 measures to protect and secure the information systems and nonpublic infor-
31 mation that are accessible to, or held by, a third-party service provider.
32 Nonpublic information is not accessible to, or held by, a third-party ser-
33 vice provider within the meaning of this section if it is encrypted and the
34 associated protective process or key necessary to assign meaning to the non-
35 public information is not within the possession of the third-party service
36 provider.
37 (3) As part of its information security program, each licensee must
38 establish a written incident response plan designed to promptly respond
39 to, and recover from, any cybersecurity event that compromises the con-
40 fidentiality, integrity, or availability of nonpublic information in its
41 possession, the licensee's information systems, or the continuing function-
42 ality of any aspect of the licensee's business or operations.
43 (4) Each licensee must maintain all records supporting its information
44 security program for a period of five (5) years. To the extent a licensee has
45 identified areas that require material improvement, the licensee must docu-
46 ment the identification and the remedial efforts planned and underway to ad-
47 dress such areas.

4
1 41-6704. INVESTIGATION OF A CYBERSECURITY EVENT. (1) If a licensee
2 learns that a cybersecurity event has or may have occurred, such licensee
3 or third-party service provider designated to act on behalf of the licensee
4 shall conduct a prompt investigation.
5 (2) During the investigation, the licensee or third-party service
6 provider designated to act on behalf of the licensee shall, to the extent
7 possible:
8 (a) Determine whether a cybersecurity event has occurred;
9 (b) Assess the nature and scope of the cybersecurity event;
10 (c) Identify any nonpublic information that may have been involved in
11 the cybersecurity event; and
12 (d) Perform or oversee reasonable measures to restore the security of
13 the information systems compromised in the cybersecurity event in order
14 to prevent further unauthorized acquisition, release, or use of nonpub-
15 lic information in the licensee's possession, custody, or control.
16 (3) If a licensee learns that a cybersecurity event has or may have oc-
17 curred that impacted the licensee's nonpublic information in a system main-
18 tained by a third-party service provider, the licensee shall complete the
19 steps provided in subsection (2) of this section or make reasonable efforts
20 to confirm and document that the third-party service provider has completed
21 such steps.
22 (4) A licensee shall maintain records concerning all cybersecurity
23 events for a period of at least five (5) years from the date of the cyberse-
24 curity event.
25 41-6705. NOTICE OF A CYBERSECURITY EVENT. (1) Each licensee must no-
26 tify the director as promptly, in the form and manner prescribed by the di-
27 rector, as reasonably practicable but not later than ten (10) business days
28 after a determination that a cybersecurity event has occurred when either:
29 (a) This state is the licensee's state of domicile, in the case of an in-
30 surer, or this state is the licensee's home state, in the case of a pro-
31 ducer, as those terms are defined in section 41-1003, Idaho Code, and
32 the cybersecurity event has a reasonable likelihood of materially harm-
33 ing:
34 (i) Any consumer residing in this state; or
35 (ii) Any material part of the normal operations of the licensee;
36 or
37 (b) The licensee reasonably believes that the nonpublic information
38 involved is of two hundred fifty (250) or more consumers residing in
39 this state and that the event is either:
40 (i) A cybersecurity event impacting the licensee of which notice
41 is required to be provided to any government body, self-regulatory
42 agency, or any other supervisory body pursuant to any state or fed-
43 eral law; or
44 (ii) A cybersecurity event that has a reasonable likelihood of ma-
45 terially harming:
46 1. Any consumer residing in this state; or
47 2. Any material part of the normal operations of the li-
48 censee.

5
1 (2) A licensee shall notify each consumer residing in this state with-
2 out unreasonable delay after a determination that a cybersecurity event has
3 occurred that is reasonably likely to result in material harm to that con-
4 sumer. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a licensee that
5 determines a cybersecurity event has occurred affecting data owned or li-
6 censed by another licensee must provide a notice to the owner or licensor of
7 the data affected by the cybersecurity event in place of the notification to
8 affected consumers.
9 (a) The licensee shall provide a copy of the notice sent to consumers to
10 the director.
11 (b) In determining whether a cybersecurity event is reasonably likely
12 to result in material harm to consumers residing in this state pursuant
13 to this subsection, a licensee shall act with the care an ordinarily
14 prudent person in like position would exercise under similar circum-
15 stances.
16 (c) A licensee may delay providing notice without violating the provi-
17 sions of this subsection if either:
18 (i) A delay is necessary in order for the licensee to take any mea-
19 sures necessary to determine the scope of the cybersecurity event
20 and restore the reasonable integrity of the information system.
21 However, the licensee must provide the notice required pursuant
22 to this section without unreasonable delay after the licensee com-
23 pletes the measures necessary to determine the scope of the cyber-
24 security event and restore the reasonable integrity of the infor-
25 mation system; or
26 (ii) A law enforcement agency determines and advises the licensee
27 that providing a notice will impede a criminal or civil investi-
28 gation or jeopardize homeland or national security. However, the
29 licensee must provide the notice required pursuant to this sec-
30 tion without unreasonable delay after the law enforcement agency
31 determines that providing the notice will no longer impede the in-
32 vestigation or jeopardize homeland or national security.
33 (3) In the case of a cybersecurity event impacting a licensee's nonpub-
34 lic information in a system maintained by a third-party service provider, of
35 which the licensee has become aware, the licensee must treat such event as
36 it would pursuant to subsection (1) of this section unless the third-party
37 service provider provides the notice required pursuant to subsection (1) of
38 this section to the director.
39 (a) The computation of the licensee's deadlines shall begin on the day
40 after the third-party service provider notifies the licensee of the cy-
41 bersecurity event or the licensee otherwise has actual knowledge of the
42 cybersecurity event, whichever is sooner.
43 (b) Nothing in this chapter prevents or abrogates an agreement between
44 a licensee and another licensee, a third-party service provider, or any
45 other party to fulfill any of the investigation requirements imposed
46 pursuant to section 41-6704, Idaho Code, or notice requirements imposed
47 pursuant to this section.
48 (4) As to notice of cybersecurity events of reinsurers to insurers:
49 (a) In the case of a cybersecurity event involving nonpublic infor-
50 mation that is used by or in the possession, custody, or control of a

6
1 licensee acting as an assuming insurer, including an assuming insurer
2 domiciled in another state or jurisdiction, and such licensee does not
3 have a direct contractual relationship with the affected consumers:
4 (i) The assuming insurer must notify its affected ceding insurers
5 and the insurance director of its state or jurisdiction of domi-
6 cile within ten (10) business days of making the determination
7 that a cybersecurity event has occurred; and
8 (ii) The ceding insurers that have a direct contractual relation-
9 ship with affected consumers must fulfill the consumer notifica-
10 tion requirements imposed pursuant to subsection (2) of this sec-
11 tion and any other notification requirements relating to a cyber-
12 security event imposed pursuant to this section.
13 (b) In the case of a cybersecurity event involving nonpublic informa-
14 tion that is in the possession, custody, or control of a third-party
15 service provider of a licensee that is an assuming insurer, including an
16 assuming insurer domiciled in another state or jurisdiction:
17 (i) The assuming insurer must notify its affected ceding insurers
18 and the insurance director of its state or jurisdiction of domi-
19 cile within ten (10) business days of receiving notice from its
20 third-party service provider that a cybersecurity event has oc-
21 curred; and
22 (ii) The ceding insurers that have a direct contractual relation-
23 ship with affected consumers must fulfill the consumer notifica-
24 tion requirements imposed pursuant to subsection (3) of this sec-
25 tion and any other notification requirements relating to a cyber-
26 security event imposed pursuant to this section.
27 (c) Any licensee acting as an assuming insurer shall not have any other
28 notice obligations relating to a cybersecurity event or other data
29 breach pursuant to this section.
30 (5) In the case of a cybersecurity event involving nonpublic infor-
31 mation that is in the possession, custody, or control of a licensee that
32 is an insurer or its third-party service provider for which a consumer ac-
33 cessed the insurer's services through an independent insurance producer,
