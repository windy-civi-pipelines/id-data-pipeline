18 for the installation, operation, and maintenance of broadband infrastruc-
19 ture.
20 (2) The department or district shall enter into a license agreement
21 with a broadband provider and issue a permit before granting it any longi-
22 tudinal access under this section. Except as specifically provided by the
23 agreement, a property interest in a right-of-way may not be granted under the
24 provisions of this section. An agreement entered into by the department or
25 district under this section:
26 (a) Shall include terms and conditions that are nondiscriminatory as
27 among broadband providers and are consistent with the public policy
28 promoting the expansion of broadband infrastructure in Idaho, such as
29 liability provisions, requirements related to the financial responsi-
30 bilities for future relocation of underground broadband infrastructure
31 if relocation is necessary, and indemnification provisions;
32 (b) Shall specify maintenance responsibilities for broadband infra-
33 structure being placed;
34 (c) May require that the department be allowed to utilize the broadband
35 infrastructure only for public safety warnings, road condition notifi-
36 cations, and amber alerts to motorists on highways;
37 (d) May With respect to the department, the agreement may require that
38 the broadband provider install conduit for nonexclusive use, in which
39 the cost of the project shall be shared proportionally. Alternatively,
40 if the department requires the broadband provider to install only one
41 (1) conduit of equal or smaller size of the conduit being installed ex-
42 clusively for internal department purposes, then the department shall
43 be responsible only for the costs of the additional materials and labor
44 for the installation of its own conduit. The department must keep all
45 documents and records regarding the internal use of the conduit and make
46 public such documents if requested. The department may not allow the
47 use of its internal conduit to any other entity. If the department al-
48 lows the use of internal conduit to another entity, then the department
49 shall reimburse the broadband provider for half of the project costs;
5
1 (e) Shall specify that the broadband provider shall own its broadband
2 infrastructure; and
3 (f) Shall specify that the use of the rights-of-way shall be nonexclu-
4 sive.
5 (3) A broadband provider shall be responsible for the costs of in-
6 stalling its own broadband infrastructure on the department's or the
7 district's right-of-way. If there is more than one (1) broadband provider
8 installing broadband infrastructure at the same project, then the broadband
9 provider is responsible for its pro rata share of the cost.
10 (4) The department shall require the same fees from a broadband
11 provider under this section for longitudinal access to the right-of-way as
12 a public utility defined under section 61-129, Idaho Code. However, fees
13 charged to a cable provider shall be in accordance with applicable federal
14 law.
15 (5) The department or district may not grant any longitudinal access
16 under this section that results in a significant compromise of the safe, ef-
17 ficient, and convenient use of a highway for the traveling public.
18 (6) The department may install conduit for its own use where appro-
19 priate or in support of expanding broadband infrastructure in the state of
20 Idaho.
21 (7) The department and district shall promulgate rules:
22 (a) Governing the installation, operation, and maintenance of broad-
23 band infrastructure granted longitudinal access pursuant to this sec-
24 tion;
25 (b) Specifying the procedures for establishing an agreement for longi-
26 tudinal access for a broadband provider;
27 (c) Specifying criteria for the installation of the department's own
28 conduit and use of such conduit by broadband providers consistent with
29 this section. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply only to the
30 department; and
31 (d) Providing for the relocation or removal of broadband infrastruc-
32 ture for needed changes to a highway on the interstate system.
33 (8) Nothing in section 40-515, Idaho Code, through this section is in-
34 tended to preempt, diminish, or otherwise limit the authority of the depart-
35 ment or district over public rights-of-way.
36 SECTION 5. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
37 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
38 July 1, 2025.

36 tral, fair, and objective as between all broadband providers and that pro-
37 mote competition among broadband providers. Rules shall include, at a mini-
38 mum:
39 (a) Procedures consistent with the "Dig Once Policy" for processing and
40 reviewing statements of interest received from a broadband provider by
41 the department or district. Consistent with the "Dig Once Policy," the
42 department or district shall issue rules that will restrict speculative
43 practices that may unduly impact and congest the department's rights-
44 of-way;
45 (b) A requirement that a broadband provider shall be charged for the
46 actual cost incurred by the department or district as a result of the
47 installation of a broadband provider's broadband infrastructure. If
48 there is more than one (1) broadband provider installing broadband
49 infrastructure, then each broadband provider shall share equally in
50 the common charges of the installation of broadband infrastructure,

4
1 including but not limited to trenching, boring, traffic controls, and
2 make-ready costs;
3 (c) Criteria for identifying projects that would be suitable for the
4 placement of broadband infrastructure;
5 (d) Criteria for the installation of the department's own conduit.
6 Rules may allow use of such conduit by broadband providers;
7 (e) Procedures and forms for permitting processes; and
8 (f) A contested case administrative appeals process, pursuant to the
9 Idaho administrative procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.
10 (9) The department or district may not grant any longitudinal access
11 under this section that results in a significant compromise of the safe, ef-
12 ficient, and convenient use of a highway for the traveling public.
13 SECTION 4. That Section 40-520, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
14 amended to read as follows:
15 40-520. RIGHTS-OF-WAY FOR BROADBAND. (1) Except as provided in sub-
16 section (5) of this section, the department or district shall allow a broad-
17 band provider longitudinal use and access to the rights-of-way of a highway
18 for the installation, operation, and maintenance of broadband infrastruc-
19 ture.
20 (2) The department or district shall enter into a license agreement
21 with a broadband provider and issue a permit before granting it any longi-
22 tudinal access under this section. Except as specifically provided by the
23 agreement, a property interest in a right-of-way may not be granted under the
24 provisions of this section. An agreement entered into by the department or
25 district under this section:
26 (a) Shall include terms and conditions that are nondiscriminatory as
27 among broadband providers and are consistent with the public policy
28 promoting the expansion of broadband infrastructure in Idaho, such as
29 liability provisions, requirements related to the financial responsi-
30 bilities for future relocation of underground broadband infrastructure
31 if relocation is necessary, and indemnification provisions;
32 (b) Shall specify maintenance responsibilities for broadband infra-
33 structure being placed;
34 (c) May require that the department be allowed to utilize the broadband
35 infrastructure only for public safety warnings, road condition notifi-
36 cations, and amber alerts to motorists on highways;
37 (d) May With respect to the department, the agreement may require that
38 the broadband provider install conduit for nonexclusive use, in which
39 the cost of the project shall be shared proportionally. Alternatively,
40 if the department requires the broadband provider to install only one
41 (1) conduit of equal or smaller size of the conduit being installed ex-
42 clusively for internal department purposes, then the department shall
43 be responsible only for the costs of the additional materials and labor
44 for the installation of its own conduit. The department must keep all
45 documents and records regarding the internal use of the conduit and make
46 public such documents if requested. The department may not allow the
47 use of its internal conduit to any other entity. If the department al-
48 lows the use of internal conduit to another entity, then the department
49 shall reimburse the broadband provider for half of the project costs;

5
1 (e) Shall specify that the broadband provider shall own its broadband
2 infrastructure; and
3 (f) Shall specify that the use of the rights-of-way shall be nonexclu-
4 sive.
5 (3) A broadband provider shall be responsible for the costs of in-
6 stalling its own broadband infrastructure on the department's or the
7 district's right-of-way. If there is more than one (1) broadband provider
8 installing broadband infrastructure at the same project, then the broadband
9 provider is responsible for its pro rata share of the cost.
10 (4) The department shall require the same fees from a broadband
11 provider under this section for longitudinal access to the right-of-way as
12 a public utility defined under section 61-129, Idaho Code. However, fees
13 charged to a cable provider shall be in accordance with applicable federal
14 law.
15 (5) The department or district may not grant any longitudinal access
16 under this section that results in a significant compromise of the safe, ef-
17 ficient, and convenient use of a highway for the traveling public.
18 (6) The department may install conduit for its own use where appro-
19 priate or in support of expanding broadband infrastructure in the state of
20 Idaho.
21 (7) The department and district shall promulgate rules:
22 (a) Governing the installation, operation, and maintenance of broad-
23 band infrastructure granted longitudinal access pursuant to this sec-
24 tion;
25 (b) Specifying the procedures for establishing an agreement for longi-
26 tudinal access for a broadband provider;
27 (c) Specifying criteria for the installation of the department's own
28 conduit and use of such conduit by broadband providers consistent with
29 this section. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply only to the
30 department; and
31 (d) Providing for the relocation or removal of broadband infrastruc-
32 ture for needed changes to a highway on the interstate system.
33 (8) Nothing in section 40-515, Idaho Code, through this section is in-
34 tended to preempt, diminish, or otherwise limit the authority of the depart-
35 ment or district over public rights-of-way.
36 SECTION 5. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
37 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
38 July 1, 2025.
