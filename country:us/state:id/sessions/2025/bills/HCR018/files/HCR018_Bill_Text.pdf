LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF IDAHO
Sixty-eighth Legislature First Regular Session - 2025
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 18
BY STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
1 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
2 STATING FINDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND RECOGNIZING MOTHER'S DAY THROUGH
3 FATHER'S DAY AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES
4 FACING TRADITIONAL FAMILIES AND THE ALARMING RATE AT WHICH THE TRADI-
5 TIONAL AMERICAN FAMILY IS DECLINING.
6 Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
7 WHEREAS, traditional families designed by God have been the foundation
8 of societies since creation. As such, traditional families operate as a
9 source of security in their communities, often attending to societal trou-
10 bles before law enforcement involvement is needed, thereby serving as the
11 cornerstone of a functional society. In a letter entitled The Crucial Role
12 of Families submitted to the United Nations by the International Federation
13 for Family Development in consult with the U.N. Economic and Social Council
14 division, the authors state: "Children growing up in healthy, married,
15 two-parent families are more likely to lead happy, healthy and successful
16 lives than those who have not experienced the same level of family security
17 and stability... Governments cannot afford to fully replace the functions
18 families perform for the benefit of their members and for the good of soci-
19 ety. The family is the most powerful, the most humane and, by far, the most
20 economical system known for building competence and character."; and
21 WHEREAS, the freedom to exercise these beliefs and values based in the
22 truth of the laws of nature and nature's God has been protected by the Consti-
23 tution of the United States since its inception; and
24 WHEREAS, traditional families consisting of a natural mother and fa-
25 ther, children, grandparents, and extended family have declined drastically
26 since 1960 when approximately 77.5% of children lived with their two par-
27 ents, who were married; and
28 WHEREAS, according to census data, in 1960, just 13% of all households
29 were single-person households. In 2018, that figure was 28%; and
30 WHEREAS, today, only 17.8% of Americans live in traditional nuclear
31 families; and
32 WHEREAS, in 1950, 27% of marriages ended in divorce. Today, about 45%
33 do; and
34 WHEREAS, in 1960, 72% of Americans were married. In 2017, nearly half of
35 Americans were single; and
36 WHEREAS, in 1960, approximately 5% of children were born to unmarried
37 women. Now, about 40% are; and
38 WHEREAS, American children are more likely to live in a single-parent
39 household than children from any other country; and
40 WHEREAS, courageous single parents encounter unique and significant
41 struggles within our society, and families serve as an important support
42 structure to help them thrive despite their circumstances; and

2
1 WHEREAS, research demonstrates children who grow up in families with
2 traditional values and gender roles are more likely to have traditional val-
3 ues and gender role expectations themselves; and
4 WHEREAS, there is an unprecedented attack on these beliefs and the cele-
5 bration of these beliefs; and
6 WHEREAS, much remains to be done to ensure that traditional family roles
7 and values are both celebrated and encouraged to provide the most nurturing
8 and healthy environment possible to raise the next generation of American
9 children.
10 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
11 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and
12 the Senate concurring therein, that the Idaho Legislature:

29 (8) Recognizes the evidence-based physical and mental health benefits
30 children receive when raised in a home with a traditional family;

34 velopment of character, morality, virtue, and spirituality that traditional
35 American family values foster; and
36 (11) Encourages communities, schools, churches, businesses, corpora-
37 tions, and other stakeholders who all benefit from the cohesiveness, peace,
38 tranquility, and civility of communities built on strong traditional family
39 values, along with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare whose mission
40 is to strengthen the health, safety, and independence of Idahoans, to take
41 part in celebrating Traditional Family Values Month in the State of Idaho.
