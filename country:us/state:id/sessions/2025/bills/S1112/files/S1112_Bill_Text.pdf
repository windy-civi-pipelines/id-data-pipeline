14 tion, with or without compulsory competitive bidding; through competi-
15 tive bidding or a request for proposals.
16 (7) (b) The board of county commissioners, before entering into such

32 conferred by law or desiring to initiate or abandon such systems shall con-
33 form to the procedures and standards set forth in this section before tak-
34 ing any action which that would significantly affect the amount or distri-
35 bution of solid waste within any county. The board of county commissioners
36 of any county may waive operation of the procedure called for in this section
37 by passage of a resolution indicating their its intent to do so. Provided

39 other public authority shall use compulsory means, including flow control,
40 to limit the private sector from competing.
41 (2) Whenever a county shall propose proposes the establishment of a new
42 solid waste processing facility within the boundaries of the county or in
43 conjunction with adjoining counties, it shall give notice to the public and
44 all municipalities within its boundaries that it intends to establish a pro-
45 cessing facility. In conjunction with the notice, the county shall provide
46 a copy of a feasibility study prepared by a licensed professional engineer
47 concerning the proposed processing facility which that shall address the es-

4
1 timated capital cost of the facility, the estimated costs of operation of the
2 facility, and the estimated life span of the facility. The notice shall be
3 provided to potentially affected municipalities at least one hundred eighty
4 (180) days prior to the scheduled initiation of construction of any solid
5 waste processing facility.
6 (3) Within ninety (90) days of receipt of the notice, each affected mu-
7 nicipality shall respond to the notice provided by the county, indicating in
8 its response the intention of the municipality to participate in the use of
9 the proposed facility or to develop or continue operation of an independent
10 solid waste processing facility of its own for the projected duration of the
11 proposed county project.
12 (4) Pursuant to the responses received from affected municipalities,
13 the county proposing development of the solid waste processing facility may
14 tender contracts to participating municipalities assuring the availabil-
15 ity of waste disposal capacity at the proposed facility for any duration
16 promised by contract and securing commitments from the municipalities to
17 participate in use of the facility for the duration of its projected life.
18 The contracts shall not constitute guarantees of costs or duration of ser-
19 viceability of the proposed facility. The contracts may provide for annual
20 adjustments to reflect changes in the relative contribution rates of mu-
21 nicipalities to the waste stream feeding the disposal facility. No capital
22 contribution obligation shall extend beyond fifteen (15) years. Additional
23 contracts for capital participation may be proposed and entered into after
24 the expiration of the initial agreement.
25 (5) Any municipality which that indicates its intent not to participate
26 in a proposed facility shall be barred from later participation without the
27 consent of the board of county commissioners and without payment of a capital
28 contribution adequate to finance the cost of additional capacity adequate to
29 accommodate the waste stream generated within the municipality. The amount
30 and method of payment of the capital contribution shall be established by the
31 board of county commissioners.
32 (6) Any municipality which that elects to participate in a given solid
33 waste processing facility, but later elects to withdraw from said project,
34 may do so, but shall remain obligated for any capital costs incurred in its
35 behalf, but may receive partial credit for operational economies created by
36 its withdrawal. The burden of proof of the extent of operational economies
37 shall rest upon the withdrawing municipality.
38 (7) Major solid waste generators located outside participating munic-
39 ipalities shall be treated in the same manner as municipalities concerning
40 commitments to waste facility capacity. Boards of county commissioners are
41 authorized to enter into contracts with major solid waste generators for the
42 expected duration of operation of any solid waste processing facility.
