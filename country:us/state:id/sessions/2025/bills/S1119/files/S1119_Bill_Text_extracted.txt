37 violations of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter or securing
38 information lawfully required under this chapter, the director may at any
39 time, either personally or by designee, investigate or examine the business
40 and wherever located, the books, accounts, records, papers, documents,
41 files, and other information used in the earned wage access services-related
42 business of every applicant, licensee, and of every person who is engaged in
43 the business of a provider, whether the person acts or claims to act under
44 or without the authority of this chapter. For these purposes, the direc-
45 tor or designated representative shall have free access to the offices and
46 places of business, books, accounts, papers, documents, other information,
47 records, files, safes, and vaults of all such persons. The director or the
7
1 director's designee may require the attendance of and examine under oath all
2 persons whose testimony may be required about the business or the subject
3 matter of any investigation, examination, or hearing and may require such
4 person to produce books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files, and
5 any other information the director or the director's designee declares is
6 relevant to the inquiry. The director may:
7 (a) Require the production of original books, accounts, papers, docu-
8 ments, records, files, and other information;
9 (b) Require that such original books, accounts, papers, documents,
10 records, files, and other information be copied; or
11 (c) Make copies himself or by designee of such original books, ac-
12 counts, papers, documents, records, files, or other information.
13 (2) The director or director's designee may issue a subpoena or sub-
14 poena duces tecum requiring attendance or compelling production of the
15 books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files, or other information.
16 Should the director conclude that an on-site examination of a licensee is
17 necessary, the licensee, subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this
18 section, shall pay all the actual costs of such examination. If the director
19 determines, based on the licensee's financial statements and past history
20 of operations in the state, that an on-site examination is unnecessary, the
21 on-site examination may be conducted electronically or in conjunction with
22 examinations to be performed by representatives of agencies of another state
23 or states. The director, in lieu of an on-site or electronic examination,
24 may accept the examination report of an agency of another state, or a report
25 prepared by an independent accounting firm, and reports so accepted are con-
26 sidered for all purposes as an official report of the director.
27 (3) In the case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, any
28 court of competent jurisdiction, upon application by the director, may issue
29 to that person an order requiring that person to appear before the director
30 or the director's designee to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or
31 to give evidence relating to the matter under investigation or in question.
32 Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a
33 contempt of court. When the director examines a licensee within this state,
34 the licensee shall pay all the actual costs of such examination, up to a max-
35 imum of one thousand dollars ($1,000).
36 (4) The director may promulgate rules, subject to legislative ap-
37 proval, necessary for the administration of this chapter. All rules promul-
38 gated by the director pursuant to authority conferred in this chapter will be
39 in accordance with the Idaho administrative procedure act, chapter 52, title
40 67, Idaho Code.
41 26-3813. MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS. (1) Each licensee shall make, keep,
42 and preserve books, accounts, and other records for a period of three (3)
43 years following the provision of proceeds to a consumer.
44 (2) Maintenance of documents as required in this section in a photo-
45 graphic, digital, or other similar form shall constitute compliance with the
46 provisions of this section.
47 (3) Records may be maintained at a location other than at a location
48 within this state as long as they are made accessible to the director on seven
49 (7) days' written notice.

1 26-3814. CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA SUBMITTED TO THE DIRECTOR. (1)
2 All information or reports obtained by the director from an applicant or
3 licensee are confidential trade secrets and may not be disclosed or dis-
4 tributed outside the department in accordance with the provisions of chapter

6 department. Such information is confidential whether obtained through re-
7 ports, applications, examinations, audits, investigations, or otherwise,
8 and includes but is not limited to:

10 tions, investigations, and operating or condition reports reported by,

13 sheets.
14 (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section,
15 the director may provide for the release of information to representatives
16 of state or federal agencies who state in writing that they shall maintain
17 the confidentiality of such information or if the director finds that the re-
18 lease is reasonably necessary for the protection of the public and in the in-
19 terests of justice.
20 (3) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the director from releasing
21 to the public a list of persons licensed under the provisions of this chapter
22 or to release aggregated, anonymized financial data on such licensees.
23 26-3815. SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF LICENSES. After notice and op-
24 portunity for hearing, the director may suspend or revoke a licensee's li-
25 cense if the director finds that:
26 (1) Any fact or condition exists that, if it had existed at the time when
27 the licensee applied for a license, would have been grounds for denying such
28 application;

37 not preclude the use by a provider of any of the methods specified in sub-

40 do they preclude a provider from pursuing an employer for breach of its con-
41 tractual obligations to the provider.
42 (4) A provider may use the mailing address or state of residence pro-
43 vided to it by a person or a person's employer to determine the person's state

45 26-3817. HEARINGS -- PROCEDURES. The provisions of the Idaho adminis-
46 trative procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, shall apply to any
47 hearing afforded pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
11
1 26-3818. CIVIL PENALTIES. (1) If, after notice and hearing, the di-
2 rector finds that a person has violated the provisions of this chapter or a
3 rule adopted under the provisions of this chapter, the director may order
4 the person to pay to the director a civil penalty in an amount specified by
5 the director, not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each violation
6 or, in the case of a continuing violation, one thousand dollars ($1,000) for
7 each day that the violation continues, but not to exceed twenty-five thou-
8 sand dollars ($25,000) in the aggregate. The provisions of the Idaho admin-
9 istrative procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, shall apply to
10 such hearing.
11 (2) The director, in the director's discretion, is authorized to com-
12 promise, settle, and collect civil penalties with any person for violations
13 of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or order issued or promul-
14 gated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
15 26-3819. ENFORCEMENT. (1) If it appears to the director that any per-
16 son has committed or is about to commit a violation of any provision of this
17 chapter or of any rule or order of the director, the director may:
18 (a) Issue a cease and desist order ordering such person to cease and de-
19 sist violating or continuing to violate any provision of this chapter or
20 any rule or order issued in accordance with this chapter; or
21 (b) Apply to the district court for an order enjoining such person from
22 violating or continuing to violate any provision of this chapter or any
23 rule or order and for injunctive or such other relief as the nature of
24 the case may require.
25 (2) The director may enter into consent orders at any time with any per-
26 son to resolve any matter arising under the provisions of this chapter. A
27 consent order must be signed by the person to whom it is issued and must indi-
28 cate agreement to the terms contained therein. A consent order need not con-
29 stitute an admission by any person that any provision of this chapter or any
30 rule or order promulgated or issued thereunder has been violated nor need it
31 constitute a finding by the director that such person has violated any provi-
32 sion of this chapter or any rule or order promulgated or issued thereunder.
33 (3) Notwithstanding the issuance of a consent order, the director may
34 seek civil or compromise civil penalties concerning matters encompassed by
35 the consent order unless the consent order by its terms expressly precludes
36 the director from so doing.
37 26-3820. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. Any licensee or other person who
38 knowingly engages in business activities that are regulated under the pro-
39 visions of this chapter, with or without filing an application, is deemed
40 to have consented to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state for all
41 actions arising under the provisions of this chapter.
42 26-3821. APPLICABILITY. A person who was acting as a provider in Idaho
43 on January 1, 2025, may continue to act as a provider if the person applies
44 for a license in accordance with the provisions of this chapter within six
45 (6) months of the date that the department makes an application available to
46 potential applicants, and complies with the requirements of this chapter,
12
1 until such time as the department grants or denies the person's application
2 for a license under this chapter.
3 26-3822. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this act are hereby declared
4 to be severable and if any provision of this act or the application of such
5 provision to any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason,
6 such declaration shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of
7 this act.
8 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
9 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after its
10 passage and approval.

36 26-3812. POWERS OF THE DIRECTOR. (1) For the purpose of discovering
37 violations of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter or securing
38 information lawfully required under this chapter, the director may at any
39 time, either personally or by designee, investigate or examine the business
40 and wherever located, the books, accounts, records, papers, documents,
41 files, and other information used in the earned wage access services-related
42 business of every applicant, licensee, and of every person who is engaged in
43 the business of a provider, whether the person acts or claims to act under
44 or without the authority of this chapter. For these purposes, the direc-
45 tor or designated representative shall have free access to the offices and
46 places of business, books, accounts, papers, documents, other information,
47 records, files, safes, and vaults of all such persons. The director or the

7
1 director's designee may require the attendance of and examine under oath all
2 persons whose testimony may be required about the business or the subject
3 matter of any investigation, examination, or hearing and may require such
4 person to produce books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files, and
5 any other information the director or the director's designee declares is
6 relevant to the inquiry. The director may:
7 (a) Require the production of original books, accounts, papers, docu-
8 ments, records, files, and other information;
9 (b) Require that such original books, accounts, papers, documents,
10 records, files, and other information be copied; or
11 (c) Make copies himself or by designee of such original books, ac-
12 counts, papers, documents, records, files, or other information.
13 (2) The director or director's designee may issue a subpoena or sub-
14 poena duces tecum requiring attendance or compelling production of the
15 books, accounts, papers, documents, records, files, or other information.
16 Should the director conclude that an on-site examination of a licensee is
17 necessary, the licensee, subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this
18 section, shall pay all the actual costs of such examination. If the director
19 determines, based on the licensee's financial statements and past history
20 of operations in the state, that an on-site examination is unnecessary, the
21 on-site examination may be conducted electronically or in conjunction with
22 examinations to be performed by representatives of agencies of another state
23 or states. The director, in lieu of an on-site or electronic examination,
24 may accept the examination report of an agency of another state, or a report
25 prepared by an independent accounting firm, and reports so accepted are con-
26 sidered for all purposes as an official report of the director.
27 (3) In the case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, any
28 court of competent jurisdiction, upon application by the director, may issue
29 to that person an order requiring that person to appear before the director
30 or the director's designee to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or
31 to give evidence relating to the matter under investigation or in question.
32 Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a
33 contempt of court. When the director examines a licensee within this state,
34 the licensee shall pay all the actual costs of such examination, up to a max-
35 imum of one thousand dollars ($1,000).
36 (4) The director may promulgate rules, subject to legislative ap-
37 proval, necessary for the administration of this chapter. All rules promul-
38 gated by the director pursuant to authority conferred in this chapter will be
39 in accordance with the Idaho administrative procedure act, chapter 52, title
40 67, Idaho Code.
41 26-3813. MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS. (1) Each licensee shall make, keep,
42 and preserve books, accounts, and other records for a period of three (3)
43 years following the provision of proceeds to a consumer.
44 (2) Maintenance of documents as required in this section in a photo-
45 graphic, digital, or other similar form shall constitute compliance with the
46 provisions of this section.
47 (3) Records may be maintained at a location other than at a location
48 within this state as long as they are made accessible to the director on seven
49 (7) days' written notice.

8
1 26-3814. CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA SUBMITTED TO THE DIRECTOR. (1)
2 All information or reports obtained by the director from an applicant or
3 licensee are confidential trade secrets and may not be disclosed or dis-
4 tributed outside the department in accordance with the provisions of chapter
5 1, title 74, Idaho Code, by the director or any officer or employee of the
6 department. Such information is confidential whether obtained through re-
7 ports, applications, examinations, audits, investigations, or otherwise,
8 and includes but is not limited to:
9 (a) All information contained in or related to applications, examina-
10 tions, investigations, and operating or condition reports reported by,
11 on behalf of, or for the use of the director; and
12 (b) Business plans or metrics, financial statements, or balance
13 sheets.
14 (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section,
15 the director may provide for the release of information to representatives
16 of state or federal agencies who state in writing that they shall maintain
17 the confidentiality of such information or if the director finds that the re-
18 lease is reasonably necessary for the protection of the public and in the in-
19 terests of justice.
20 (3) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the director from releasing
21 to the public a list of persons licensed under the provisions of this chapter
22 or to release aggregated, anonymized financial data on such licensees.
23 26-3815. SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF LICENSES. After notice and op-
24 portunity for hearing, the director may suspend or revoke a licensee's li-
25 cense if the director finds that:
26 (1) Any fact or condition exists that, if it had existed at the time when
27 the licensee applied for a license, would have been grounds for denying such
28 application;
29 (2) The licensee violated any provisions of this chapter or any rule or
30 order of the director under the provisions of this chapter;
31 (3) The licensee is conducting its business in an unsafe or unsound man-
32 ner;

38 nization, arrangement, or other relief under any bankruptcy;
39 (7) The licensee refuses to permit the director to make any examination
40 authorized in this chapter; or

42 chapter.

33 (h) Provide proceeds to a consumer by any means mutually agreed upon by
34 the consumer and the provider; and

2 rector finds that a person has violated the provisions of this chapter or a
3 rule adopted under the provisions of this chapter, the director may order
4 the person to pay to the director a civil penalty in an amount specified by
5 the director, not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each violation
6 or, in the case of a continuing violation, one thousand dollars ($1,000) for
7 each day that the violation continues, but not to exceed twenty-five thou-
8 sand dollars ($25,000) in the aggregate. The provisions of the Idaho admin-
9 istrative procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, shall apply to
10 such hearing.
11 (2) The director, in the director's discretion, is authorized to com-

26 son to resolve any matter arising under the provisions of this chapter. A

28 cate agreement to the terms contained therein. A consent order need not con-
29 stitute an admission by any person that any provision of this chapter or any
30 rule or order promulgated or issued thereunder has been violated nor need it
31 constitute a finding by the director that such person has violated any provi-
32 sion of this chapter or any rule or order promulgated or issued thereunder.
33 (3) Notwithstanding the issuance of a consent order, the director may
34 seek civil or compromise civil penalties concerning matters encompassed by
35 the consent order unless the consent order by its terms expressly precludes
36 the director from so doing.
37 26-3820. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. Any licensee or other person who
38 knowingly engages in business activities that are regulated under the pro-

46 potential applicants, and complies with the requirements of this chapter,

12
1 until such time as the department grants or denies the person's application
2 for a license under this chapter.
3 26-3822. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this act are hereby declared
4 to be severable and if any provision of this act or the application of such
5 provision to any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason,
6 such declaration shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of
7 this act.
8 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
9 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after its
10 passage and approval.
