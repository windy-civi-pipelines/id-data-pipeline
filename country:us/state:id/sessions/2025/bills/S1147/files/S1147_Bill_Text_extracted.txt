26 COMPUTATION OF ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL SUPPORT UNITS
27 (Computation of alternative school support units shall include
28 grades 6 through 12)
29 Pupils in Attendance Attendance Divisor Minimum Units
30 Allowed
31 12 or more.......... 12................................ 1 or more as
32 computed
33 In applying these tables to any given separate attendance unit, no
34 school district shall receive less total money than it would receive if it
35 had a lesser average daily attendance in such separate attendance unit. In
36 applying the kindergarten table to a kindergarten program of fewer days
37 than a full school year, the support unit allowance shall be in ratio to the
11
1 number of days of a full school year. The attendance of students attending
2 an alternative school in a school district reporting fewer than one hundred
3 (100) secondary students in average daily attendance shall not be assigned
4 to the alternative table if the student is from a school district reporting
5 fewer than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance,
6 but shall instead be assigned to the secondary table of the school district
7 in which they are attending the alternative school, unless the alternative
8 school in question serves students from multiple districts reporting fewer
9 than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance. The
10 tables for exceptional education and alternative school support units shall
11 be applicable only for programs approved by the state department of educa-
12 tion following rules established by the state board of education. Moneys
13 generated from computation of support units for alternative schools shall be
14 utilized for alternative school programs. School district administrative
15 and facility costs may be included as part of the alternative school expen-
16 ditures.
17 (5) State Distribution Factor per Support Unit. Divide educational
18 support program distribution funds, after subtracting the amounts necessary
19 to pay the obligations specified in subsection (2) of this section, by the
20 total state support units to secure the state distribution factor per sup-
21 port unit.
22 (6) District Support Units. The number of support units for each school
23 district in the state shall be determined as follows:
24 (a)(i) Divide the actual average daily attendance, excluding stu-
25 dents approved for inclusion in the exceptional child educational
26 program for the administrative schools and each of the separate
27 schools and attendance units, by the appropriate divisor from the
28 tables of support units in this section, then add the quotients
29 to obtain the district's support units allowance for regular stu-
30 dents, kindergarten through grade 12 including alternative school
31 students. Calculations in application of this subsection shall be
32 carried out to the nearest hundredth.
33 (ii) Divide the combined totals of the average daily attendance
34 of all preschool, kindergarten, elementary, secondary, juvenile
35 detention center students and students with disabilities approved
36 for inclusion in the exceptional child program of the district by
37 the appropriate divisor from the table for computation of excep-
38 tional education support units to obtain the number of support
39 units allowed for the district's approved exceptional child pro-
40 gram. Calculations for this subsection shall be carried out to the
41 nearest hundredth when more than one (1) unit is allowed.
42 (iii) The total number of support units of the district shall be
43 the sum of the total support units for regular students, subpara-
44 graph (i) of this paragraph, and the support units allowance for
45 the approved exceptional child program, subparagraph (ii) of this
46 paragraph.
47 (b) Total District Allowance Educational Program. Multiply the dis-
48 trict's total number of support units, carried out to the nearest hun-
49 dredth, by the state distribution factor per support unit and to this
50 product add the approved amount of programs of the district provided in
12
1 subsection (2) of this section to secure the district's total allowance
2 for the educational support program.
3 (c) District Share. The district's share of state apportionment is the
4 amount of the total district allowance, paragraph (b) of this subsec-
5 tion.
6 (d) Adjustment of District Share. The contract salary of every noncer-
7 tificated teacher shall be subtracted from the district's share as cal-
8 culated from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this subsection.
9 (7) Property Tax Computation Ratio. In order to receive state funds
10 pursuant to this section, a charter district shall utilize a school mainte-
11 nance and operation property tax computation ratio for the purpose of calcu-
12 lating its maintenance and operation levy that is no greater than that which
13 it utilized in tax year 1994, less four-tenths of one percent (.4%). As used
14 herein, the term "property tax computation ratio" shall mean a ratio deter-
15 mined by dividing the district's certified property tax maintenance and op-
16 eration budget by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment pur-
17 poses as such values existed on December 31, 1993. Such maintenance and op-
18 eration levy shall be based on the property tax computation ratio multiplied
19 by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment purposes as such values
20 existed on December 31 of the prior calendar year.
21 SECTION 3. That Section 33-512D, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
22 amended to read as follows:
23 33-512D. SELF-DIRECTED LEARNER DESIGNATION. (1) A student attending
24 public school in Idaho shall be eligible to be designated as a self-directed
25 learner. For the purposes of this section, a "self-directed learner" means a
26 full-time student:
27 (a) Who demonstrates mastery of content knowledge through grades, as-
28 sessments, or mastery-based learning rubrics;
29 (b) Whose teacher or teachers designate the student as such. The
30 teacher may consider the student's mastery of the content, academic
31 growth, timeliness for assignments, self-motivation, ability to estab-
32 lish goals, and reaching age-appropriate learning outcomes;
33 (c) Who, starting in grade 5, demonstrates mastery of addition and mul-
34 tiplication for numbers 0-10, as well as related subtraction and divi-
35 sion problems, known collectively as "math facts"; and
36 (d) Who, starting in grade 8, demonstrates an informed choice of post-
37 secondary career and education goals by:
38 (i) Completing and updating his student learning plan as defined
39 in section 33-1001(30)(31), Idaho Code;
40 (ii) Supplementing his student learning plan, as applicable, with
41 the following that further his postsecondary goals:
42 1. Extended learning opportunities as defined in section
43 33-6401, Idaho Code;
44 2. Courses and examinations funded in chapter 46, title 33,
45 Idaho Code; or
46 3. Any other credits or programs permitted under Idaho Code
47 or district policy as applicable to the student's learning
48 plan; and
13
1 (iii) Identifying and writing down self-determined personal life
2 goals, including an explanation of how attending specific classes
3 will lead to the fulfillment of personal life goals.
4 (2) Each school district or public charter school may adopt a self-di-
5 rected learner policy to provide processes:
6 (a) Through which students may seek a self-directed learner designa-
7 tion;
8 (b) By which teachers may designate a student as a self-directed
9 learner;
10 (c) To monitor and support self-directed learners;
11 (d) By which a student's teacher or teachers rescind the self-directed
12 learner designation; and
13 (e) As otherwise necessary for implementation.
14 (3) Once a student is designated a self-directed learner, the student
15 has the right to flexible learning. Flexible learning may be different for
16 each student and may include flexible attendance, attending school virtu-
17 ally, extended learning opportunities, and any other agreed-upon learning
18 inside or outside the classroom. Starting in grade 8, flexible learning
19 should further the student's progress toward postsecondary goals. Any flex-
20 ible learning permitted under this section must be agreed upon by the stu-
21 dent, his teacher or teachers, and the student's parents or legal guardian.
22 (4) In order to remain a self-directed learner, the student must meet
23 criteria agreed upon by him, his teacher or teachers, and his parents or le-
24 gal guardian. Criteria may include continued mastery of content knowledge
25 and skills, academic growth, progress toward postsecondary goals, or other
26 measures of student learning. If a student fails to meet the agreed-upon
27 criteria or fails to stay current on classroom assignments, and does not cure
28 the failure within an agreed-upon time frame, the building administrator
29 shall rescind the self-directed learner designation upon recommendation by
30 the teacher or teachers.
31 (5) A self-directed learner will be reported as enrolled as one (1.0)
32 FTE or in attendance for a full day in school for the purpose of calculat-
33 ing support units and public school funding. The district or charter school
34 will receive full funding for its self-directed learners, regardless of at-
35 tendance or actual hours of instruction up to one (1) full day of attendance
36 or one (1.0) FTE, or the remaining day or FTE if the student is shared between
37 two (2) or more school districts or public charter schools.
38 (6) Each school district or public charter school must report the num-
39 ber of self-directed learners to the state department of education annually.
40 SECTION 4. That Section 33-515, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
41 amended to read as follows:
42 33-515. ISSUANCE OF RENEWABLE CONTRACTS. (1) During the third full
43 year of continuous employment by the same school district, including
44 any specially chartered district, each certificated employee named in
45 subsection (34) of section 33-1001(35), Idaho Code, and each school nurse
46 and school librarian who has obtained a professional endorsement under
47 section 33-1201A, Idaho Code, shall be evaluated for a renewable contract
48 and shall, upon having been offered a contract for the next ensuing year,
49 and upon signing and timely returning a contract for a fourth full year, be
14
1 placed on a renewable contract status with said school district entitling
2 such individual to the right to automatic renewal of contract, subject to the
3 provisions included in this chapter, provided that instructional staff who
4 have not obtained a professional endorsement under section 33-1201A, Idaho
5 Code, may not be placed on a renewable contract status, provided however, if
6 the career ladder pursuant to section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, is not funded,
7 then a professional endorsement shall not be required. Additionally, any
8 individual who has not successfully completed the three (3) year nontradi-
9 tional route program while on a three (3) year interim certificate and has
10 not yet been issued a five (5) year renewable certificate may not be placed on
11 a renewable contract. Such individual will remain on a category 3 contract,
12 even after serving three (3) continuous years of employment with the same
13 school district.
14 (2) At least once annually, the performance of each renewable contract
15 certificated employee, school nurse, or school librarian shall be evaluated
16 according to criteria and procedures established by the board of trustees in
17 accordance with general guidelines approved by the state board of education.
18 Such an evaluation shall be completed no later than June 1 of each year. The
19 evaluation shall include a minimum of two (2) documented observations, one
20 (1) of which shall be completed prior to January 1 of each year.
21 (3) Any contract automatically renewed under the provisions of this
22 section may be renewed for a shorter term, longer term or the same length
23 of term as stated in the current contract and at a greater, lesser or equal
24 salary as that stated in the current contract. Absent the board's applica-
25 tion of a formal reduction in force, renewals of standard teacher contracts
26 may be for a shorter term, longer term or the same length of term as stated
27 in the current standard teacher contract and at a greater, lesser or equal
28 salary, and shall be uniformly applied to all employees based upon the dis-
29 trict's adopted salary schedule to the extent allowable in section 33-1004E,
30 Idaho Code.
31 (a) Contracts issued pursuant to this section shall be issued on or be-
32 fore the first day of July each year.
33 (b) At the discretion of the board, the district may issue letters of
34 intent for employment for the next ensuing school year to renewable
35 contract status employees during May of each school year. Such let-
36 ter of intent shall not state a specific duration of the contract or
37 salary/benefits term for the next ensuing school year.
38 (c) Unless otherwise negotiated and ratified by both parties pursuant
39 to section 33-1271 et seq., Idaho Code, standard teacher renewals for
40 terms shorter in length than that stated in the current standard con-
41 tract of renewable certificated employees, should be considered and im-
42 plemented only after the district has determined that the salary-based
43 apportionment reimbursement that it estimates it will receive for the
44 ensuing school year is less than the sum the district would otherwise be
45 paying for salaries for certificated professional employees.
46 (4) Nothing in this section shall prevent the board of trustees from of-
47 fering a renewed contract increasing the salary of any certificated person,
48 or from reassigning an administrative employee to a nonadministrative posi-
49 tion with appropriate reduction of salary from the preexisting salary level.
50 In the event the board of trustees reassigns an administrative employee to a
15
1 nonadministrative position, the board shall give written notice to the em-
2 ployee that contains a statement of the reasons for the reassignment. The
3 employee, upon written request to the board, shall be entitled to an informal
4 review of that decision. The process and procedure for the informal review
5 shall be determined by the local board of trustees.
6 (5) Before a board of trustees can determine not to renew for reasons of
7 an unsatisfactory report of the performance of any certificated person whose
8 contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, such person shall be en-
9 titled to a reasonable period of probation. This period of probation shall
10 be preceded by a written notice from the board of trustees with reasons for
11 such probationary period and with provisions for adequate supervision and
12 evaluation of the person's performance during the probationary period. Such
13 period of probation shall not affect the person's renewable contract status.
14 Consideration of probationary status for certificated personnel is consid-
15 eration of the status of an employee within the meaning of section 74-206,
16 Idaho Code, and may be held in executive session. If the consideration re-
17 sults in probationary status, the individual on probation shall not be named
18 in the minutes of the meeting. A record of the decision shall be placed in the
19 teacher's personnel file.
20 (6) If the board of trustees takes action to immediately discharge
21 or discharge upon termination of the current contract a certificated per-
22 son whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, the action
23 of the board shall be consistent with the procedures specified in section
24 33-513(5), Idaho Code, and, furthermore, the board shall notify the employee
25 in writing whether there is just and reasonable cause not to renew the con-
26 tract or to reduce the salary of the affected employee, and, if so, what
27 reasons it relied upon in that determination.
28 (7) If the board of trustees takes action after the declaration of a fi-
29 nancial emergency pursuant to section 33-522, Idaho Code, and such action is
30 directed at more than one (1) certificated employee, and if mutually agreed
31 to by both parties, a single informal review shall be conducted. Without
32 mutual consent of both parties, the board of trustees shall use the follow-
33 ing procedure to conduct a single due process hearing within sixty-seven
34 (67) days of the declaration of financial emergency pursuant to section
35 33-522(2), Idaho Code, or on or before June 22, whichever shall occur first:
36 (a) The superintendent or any other duly authorized administrative of-
37 ficer of the school district may recommend the change in the length of
38 the term stated in the current contract or reduce the salary of any cer-
39 tificated employee by filing with the board of trustees written notice
40 specifying the purported reasons for such changes.
41 (b) Upon receipt of such notice, the board of trustees, acting through
42 its duly authorized administrative official, shall give the affected
43 employees written notice of the reductions and the recommendation of
44 the change in the length of the term stated in the current contract or
45 the reduction of salary, along with written notice of a hearing be-
46 fore the board of trustees prior to any determination by the board of
47 trustees.
48 (c) The hearing shall be scheduled to take place not less than six (6)
49 days nor more than fourteen (14) days after receipt of the notice by the
16
1 employees. The date provided for the hearing may be changed by mutual
2 consent.
3 (d) The hearing shall be open to the public.
4 (e) All testimony at the hearing shall be given under oath or affirma-
5 tion. Any member of the board, or the clerk of the board of trustees, may
6 administer oaths to witnesses or affirmations by witnesses.
7 (f) The employees may be represented by legal counsel and/or by a repre-
8 sentative of a local or state education association.
9 (g) The chairman of the board of trustees or the designee of the chair-
10 man shall conduct the hearing.
11 (h) The board of trustees shall cause an electronic record of the hear-
12 ing to be made or shall employ a competent reporter to take stenographic
13 or stenotype notes of all the testimony at the hearing. A transcript of
14 the hearing shall be provided at cost by the board of trustees upon re-
15 quest of the employee.
16 (i) At the hearing, the superintendent or other duly authorized admin-
17 istrative officer shall present evidence to substantiate the reduction
18 contained in such notice.
19 (j) The employees may produce evidence to refute the reduction. Any
20 witness presented by the superintendent or by the employees shall be
21 subject to cross-examination. The board of trustees may also examine
22 witnesses and be represented by counsel.
23 (k) The affected employees may file written briefs and arguments with
24 the board of trustees within three (3) days after the close of the hear-
25 ing or such other time as may be agreed upon by the affected employees
26 and the board of trustees.
27 (l) Within seven (7) days following the close of the hearing, the board
28 of trustees shall determine and, acting through its duly authorized ad-
29 ministrative official, shall notify the employees in writing whether
30 the evidence presented at the hearing established the need for the ac-
31 tion taken.
32 The due process hearing pursuant to this subsection shall not be required if
33 the board of trustees and the local education association reach an agreement
34 on issues agreed upon pursuant to section 33-522(3), Idaho Code.
35 (8) If the board of trustees, for reasons other than unsatisfactory
36 service, for the ensuing contract year, determines to change the length of
37 the term stated in the current contract, reduce the salary or not renew the
38 contract of a certificated person whose contract would otherwise be automat-
39 ically renewed, nothing herein shall require a probationary period.
40 (9) If the board of trustees, for reasons other than unsatisfactory
41 service, for the ensuing contract year, determines to change the length
42 of the term stated in the current contract or reduce the salary of a cer-
43 tificated person whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed,
44 nothing herein shall require any individualized due process proceeding. In
45 such circumstance, the board shall hold a single informal review for all im-
46 pacted employees. The process and procedure for the single informal review
47 shall be determined by the local board of trustees.
48 SECTION 5. That Section 33-911, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
49 amended to read as follows:
17
1 33-911. SCHOOL DISTRICT FACILITIES FUND. (1) There is hereby cre-
2 ated in the state treasury the school district facilities fund. The fund
3 shall consist of moneys provided pursuant to sections 57-811, 63-3638, and
4 67-7434, Idaho Code, and any legislative transfers or appropriations. In-
5 terest earned from the investment of moneys in the fund shall be returned to
6 the fund.
7 (2) The moneys in the fund shall be distributed by the state controller
8 to the state department of education by August 1 each year for the purpose of
9 construction or renovation of school facilities. The moneys shall be dis-
10 tributed by the state department of education to each school district, as
11 defined in section 33-1001(21)(22), Idaho Code, first as provided in sub-
12 section (7) of this section and then on a per-pupil basis using the average
13 daily attendance calculation provided in section 33-1003A, Idaho Code, for
14 each student in kindergarten through grade 12 at physical facilities that
15 are part of and on school grounds of the school district in which the student
16 is enrolled with verification, as needed, by the office of the state board
17 of education. Upon formal approval by the state board of education, a school
18 district may receive an exemption to the physical facility requirement pur-
19 suant to this subsection if the student would have attended a physical facil-
20 ity in the school district if not for a stated emergency. The state depart-
21 ment of education shall transfer the moneys by no later than August 31 each
22 year to each school district. Such moneys shall be used in place of property
23 tax levy moneys and shall be expended by a school district for one (1) or more
24 of the purposes set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.
25 Moneys in the fund must be used by a school district in the following order of
26 priority:
27 (a) Payment of existing school bonds authorized pursuant to chapter 11,
28 title 33, Idaho Code;
29 (b) Payment of supplemental school levies authorized pursuant to sec-
30 tion 33-802, Idaho Code, excluding indefinite term supplemental levies
31 described in section 33-802(5), Idaho Code;
32 (c) Payment of school plant facility levies authorized pursuant to sec-
33 tions 33-804 and 33-804A, Idaho Code; and
34 (d) Any moneys that remain following the payments provided in para-
35 graphs (a) through (c) of this subsection may be: used for construction
36 of a new school facility, renovation, or maintenance needs; used to
37 secure and make payments on a new school facilities bond; or saved in
38 a reserve account by the school district for future school facility
39 needs. Uses of funds shall include regular and routine facilities
40 maintenance, including preventive maintenance, building repairs, and
41 building security, and periodic major facilities projects that involve
42 planning, design, construction, renovation, retrofitting, and replac-
43 ing of buildings and building systems, components, and features, as
44 well as site acquisition, site improvements, and new construction.
45 (3) The amount of moneys received by a school district pursuant to this
46 section must be deducted from a school levy that would otherwise have been
47 paid by property taxpayers. Such moneys may not be duplicated by the collec-
48 tion of property tax, and no property taxes may be collected in order to make
49 extra payments on expenses described in subsection (2) of this section in ex-
50 cess of required amounts.
18
1 (4) Each school district shall identify the amount received in the cur-
2 rent year pursuant to this section in the certification of its budget in ac-
3 cordance with section 63-803, Idaho Code. Said amount must be subtracted
4 from the amount to be levied. The amount of moneys thereby saved from being
5 collected by a property tax levy shall be reported on each property tax no-
6 tice pursuant to section 63-902, Idaho Code.
7 (5) Each school district shall report annually to the state department
8 of education, in a manner prescribed by it, on the expenditure of moneys it
9 has received pursuant to this section. The state department of education
10 shall present the reports to the legislature each January.
11 (6) For the purposes of this section, the Idaho school for the deaf and
12 the blind shall be considered a school district and shall receive a distribu-
13 tion based on the average daily attendance of the school.
14 (7)(a) For state fiscal year 2025 only, any school district that would
15 have received support from the bond levy equalization support program
16 for a qualified bond passed prior to January 1, 2024, and for which prop-
17 erty taxes were levied in property tax year 2023 pursuant to the amount
18 intended by the bond shall receive a distribution of funds from the dis-
19 tribution provided under subsection (2) of this section of at least as
20 much as would have been provided through bond levy equalization support
21 on July 1, 2024.
22 (b) For state fiscal year 2026 only, any school district that would have
23 received support from the bond levy equalization support program for a
24 qualified bond passed prior to January 1, 2024, and for which property
25 taxes were levied in property tax year 2024 pursuant to the amount in-
26 tended by the bond shall receive a distribution of funds from the dis-
27 tribution provided under subsection (2) of this section of at least as
28 much as would have been provided through bond levy equalization support
29 on July 1, 2025.
30 (c) The state department of education may adjust distributions for re-
31 maining districts proportionally as necessary pursuant to this para-
32 graph. On and after July 1, 2024, school districts may use funds pro-
33 vided in this section and section 33-913, Idaho Code, to offset the bond
34 levy equalization support.
35 SECTION 6. That Section 33-915, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
36 amended to read as follows:
37 33-915. FIXED DISTRIBUTION -- SCHOOL MODERNIZATION FACILITIES
38 FUND. (1) The state department of education shall establish a fixed distri-
39 bution of funds to be made available for voluntary election to each school
40 district subject to the conditions in this section.
41 (a) The distribution shall be calculated in state fiscal year 2025
42 for each school district, as defined in section 33-1001(21)(22), Idaho
43 Code, that is in operation as of July 1, 2024.
44 (b) The distribution shall be calculated by multiplying the following
45 two (2) factors, both of which shall be based on the most recent data
46 available in the state fiscal year coinciding with the distribution
47 calculation:
48 (i) Calculate the per-pupil amount, using the average daily at-
49 tendance calculation provided in section 33-1003A, Idaho Code,
19
1 for each student in kindergarten through grade 12 at physical
2 facilities that are part of and on school grounds of the school
3 district in which the student is enrolled with verification, as
4 needed, by the office of the state board of education. Upon formal
5 approval by the state board of education, a school district may re-
6 ceive an exemption to the physical facility requirement pursuant
7 to this subsection if the student would have attended a physical
8 facility in the school district if not for a stated emergency; and
9 (ii) Calculate, together with the Idaho state building authority,
10 the total amount that a bond issuance would generate, based on the
11 amount established in section 63-3638(19), Idaho Code.
12 (c) In no case shall the amount awarded to any school district be less
13 than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) over the ten (10) year pe-
14 riod.
15 (d) In no case shall the amount awarded to any school district with an
16 active charter district maintenance and operation levy pursuant to sec-
17 tion 33-802(6), Idaho Code, or a charter district supplemental mainte-
18 nance and operation levy pursuant to section 33-802(4), Idaho Code, ex-
19 ceed forty million dollars ($40,000,000) over the ten (10) year period.
20 Excess funds shall be distributed proportionately according to the
21 factors established in paragraph (b) of this subsection to remaining
22 school districts that received initial allocations below forty million
23 dollars ($40,000,000). Any districts receiving reallocations under
24 this paragraph shall not exceed forty million dollars ($40,000,000).
25 (e) For the purposes of this section, the Idaho school for the deaf and
26 the blind shall be considered a school district and shall receive a dis-
27 tribution based on the average daily attendance of the school.
28 (2) The provisions of this section shall be null, void, and of no force
29 and effect on and after June 30, 2034.

38 ter school that has greater than one (1) but fewer than five (5)
39 students in kindergarten through grade 3 will receive a minimum of
40 two thousand dollars ($2,000). Economically disadvantaged stu-
41 dents shall count as one and three quarters (1.75) students for the
42 purpose of calculating the distribution of the funds in subpara-
43 graph (ii) of this paragraph.

35 seventy-five hundredths (1.75) students for the purpose of calcu-
36 lating the distribution of the funds in subparagraphs (i) and (ii)
37 of this paragraph.
38 (iv) The state department of education shall compile and review
39 performance data for the calculated measures for each school dis-
40 trict and public charter school annually. Based on this data and
41 findings, during the 2030 regular legislative session, the house
42 and senate education committees shall conduct a policy review of
43 outcomes-based funding and provide a recommendation to the joint
44 finance-appropriations committee about future funding. The house

6 shall be the sum of the average daily attendance of all of the school dis-
7 tricts of the state. The state board of education shall establish rules set-
8 ting forth the procedure to determine average daily attendance and the time
9 for, and method of, submission of such report. Average daily attendance cal-
10 culation shall be carried out to the nearest hundredth. Computation of av-
11 erage daily attendance shall also be governed by the provisions of section
12 33-1003A, Idaho Code.
13 (4) Support Units. The total state support units shall be determined
14 by using the tables set out hereafter called computation of kindergarten
15 support units, computation of elementary support units, computation of sec-
16 ondary support units, computation of exceptional education support units,
17 and computation of alternative school support units. The sum of all of the
18 total support units of all school districts of the state shall be the total
19 state support units.

35 had a lesser average daily attendance in such separate attendance unit. In
36 applying the kindergarten table to a kindergarten program of fewer days
37 than a full school year, the support unit allowance shall be in ratio to the

11
1 number of days of a full school year. The attendance of students attending
2 an alternative school in a school district reporting fewer than one hundred
3 (100) secondary students in average daily attendance shall not be assigned
4 to the alternative table if the student is from a school district reporting
5 fewer than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance,
6 but shall instead be assigned to the secondary table of the school district
7 in which they are attending the alternative school, unless the alternative
8 school in question serves students from multiple districts reporting fewer
9 than one hundred (100) secondary students in average daily attendance. The
10 tables for exceptional education and alternative school support units shall
11 be applicable only for programs approved by the state department of educa-
12 tion following rules established by the state board of education. Moneys
13 generated from computation of support units for alternative schools shall be
14 utilized for alternative school programs. School district administrative
15 and facility costs may be included as part of the alternative school expen-
16 ditures.
17 (5) State Distribution Factor per Support Unit. Divide educational
18 support program distribution funds, after subtracting the amounts necessary
19 to pay the obligations specified in subsection (2) of this section, by the
20 total state support units to secure the state distribution factor per sup-
21 port unit.
22 (6) District Support Units. The number of support units for each school
23 district in the state shall be determined as follows:
24 (a)(i) Divide the actual average daily attendance, excluding stu-
25 dents approved for inclusion in the exceptional child educational
26 program for the administrative schools and each of the separate
27 schools and attendance units, by the appropriate divisor from the
28 tables of support units in this section, then add the quotients
29 to obtain the district's support units allowance for regular stu-
30 dents, kindergarten through grade 12 including alternative school
31 students. Calculations in application of this subsection shall be
32 carried out to the nearest hundredth.
33 (ii) Divide the combined totals of the average daily attendance
34 of all preschool, kindergarten, elementary, secondary, juvenile
35 detention center students and students with disabilities approved
36 for inclusion in the exceptional child program of the district by
37 the appropriate divisor from the table for computation of excep-
38 tional education support units to obtain the number of support
39 units allowed for the district's approved exceptional child pro-
40 gram. Calculations for this subsection shall be carried out to the
41 nearest hundredth when more than one (1) unit is allowed.
42 (iii) The total number of support units of the district shall be
43 the sum of the total support units for regular students, subpara-
44 graph (i) of this paragraph, and the support units allowance for
45 the approved exceptional child program, subparagraph (ii) of this
46 paragraph.
47 (b) Total District Allowance Educational Program. Multiply the dis-
48 trict's total number of support units, carried out to the nearest hun-
49 dredth, by the state distribution factor per support unit and to this
50 product add the approved amount of programs of the district provided in

12
1 subsection (2) of this section to secure the district's total allowance
2 for the educational support program.
3 (c) District Share. The district's share of state apportionment is the
4 amount of the total district allowance, paragraph (b) of this subsec-
5 tion.
6 (d) Adjustment of District Share. The contract salary of every noncer-
7 tificated teacher shall be subtracted from the district's share as cal-
8 culated from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this subsection.
9 (7) Property Tax Computation Ratio. In order to receive state funds
10 pursuant to this section, a charter district shall utilize a school mainte-
11 nance and operation property tax computation ratio for the purpose of calcu-
12 lating its maintenance and operation levy that is no greater than that which
13 it utilized in tax year 1994, less four-tenths of one percent (.4%). As used
14 herein, the term "property tax computation ratio" shall mean a ratio deter-
15 mined by dividing the district's certified property tax maintenance and op-
16 eration budget by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment pur-
17 poses as such values existed on December 31, 1993. Such maintenance and op-
18 eration levy shall be based on the property tax computation ratio multiplied
19 by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment purposes as such values
20 existed on December 31 of the prior calendar year.
21 SECTION 3. That Section 33-512D, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
22 amended to read as follows:
23 33-512D. SELF-DIRECTED LEARNER DESIGNATION. (1) A student attending
24 public school in Idaho shall be eligible to be designated as a self-directed
25 learner. For the purposes of this section, a "self-directed learner" means a
26 full-time student:
27 (a) Who demonstrates mastery of content knowledge through grades, as-
28 sessments, or mastery-based learning rubrics;
29 (b) Whose teacher or teachers designate the student as such. The
30 teacher may consider the student's mastery of the content, academic
31 growth, timeliness for assignments, self-motivation, ability to estab-
32 lish goals, and reaching age-appropriate learning outcomes;
33 (c) Who, starting in grade 5, demonstrates mastery of addition and mul-
34 tiplication for numbers 0-10, as well as related subtraction and divi-
35 sion problems, known collectively as "math facts"; and
36 (d) Who, starting in grade 8, demonstrates an informed choice of post-
37 secondary career and education goals by:
38 (i) Completing and updating his student learning plan as defined
39 in section 33-1001(30)(31), Idaho Code;
40 (ii) Supplementing his student learning plan, as applicable, with
41 the following that further his postsecondary goals:
42 1. Extended learning opportunities as defined in section
43 33-6401, Idaho Code;
44 2. Courses and examinations funded in chapter 46, title 33,
45 Idaho Code; or
46 3. Any other credits or programs permitted under Idaho Code
47 or district policy as applicable to the student's learning
48 plan; and

13
1 (iii) Identifying and writing down self-determined personal life
2 goals, including an explanation of how attending specific classes
3 will lead to the fulfillment of personal life goals.
4 (2) Each school district or public charter school may adopt a self-di-
5 rected learner policy to provide processes:
6 (a) Through which students may seek a self-directed learner designa-
7 tion;
8 (b) By which teachers may designate a student as a self-directed
9 learner;
10 (c) To monitor and support self-directed learners;
11 (d) By which a student's teacher or teachers rescind the self-directed
12 learner designation; and
13 (e) As otherwise necessary for implementation.
14 (3) Once a student is designated a self-directed learner, the student
15 has the right to flexible learning. Flexible learning may be different for
16 each student and may include flexible attendance, attending school virtu-
17 ally, extended learning opportunities, and any other agreed-upon learning
18 inside or outside the classroom. Starting in grade 8, flexible learning
19 should further the student's progress toward postsecondary goals. Any flex-
20 ible learning permitted under this section must be agreed upon by the stu-
21 dent, his teacher or teachers, and the student's parents or legal guardian.
22 (4) In order to remain a self-directed learner, the student must meet
23 criteria agreed upon by him, his teacher or teachers, and his parents or le-
24 gal guardian. Criteria may include continued mastery of content knowledge
25 and skills, academic growth, progress toward postsecondary goals, or other
26 measures of student learning. If a student fails to meet the agreed-upon
27 criteria or fails to stay current on classroom assignments, and does not cure
28 the failure within an agreed-upon time frame, the building administrator
29 shall rescind the self-directed learner designation upon recommendation by
30 the teacher or teachers.
31 (5) A self-directed learner will be reported as enrolled as one (1.0)
32 FTE or in attendance for a full day in school for the purpose of calculat-
33 ing support units and public school funding. The district or charter school
34 will receive full funding for its self-directed learners, regardless of at-
35 tendance or actual hours of instruction up to one (1) full day of attendance
36 or one (1.0) FTE, or the remaining day or FTE if the student is shared between
37 two (2) or more school districts or public charter schools.
38 (6) Each school district or public charter school must report the num-
39 ber of self-directed learners to the state department of education annually.
40 SECTION 4. That Section 33-515, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
41 amended to read as follows:
42 33-515. ISSUANCE OF RENEWABLE CONTRACTS. (1) During the third full
43 year of continuous employment by the same school district, including
44 any specially chartered district, each certificated employee named in
45 subsection (34) of section 33-1001(35), Idaho Code, and each school nurse
46 and school librarian who has obtained a professional endorsement under
47 section 33-1201A, Idaho Code, shall be evaluated for a renewable contract
48 and shall, upon having been offered a contract for the next ensuing year,
49 and upon signing and timely returning a contract for a fourth full year, be

14
1 placed on a renewable contract status with said school district entitling
2 such individual to the right to automatic renewal of contract, subject to the
3 provisions included in this chapter, provided that instructional staff who
4 have not obtained a professional endorsement under section 33-1201A, Idaho
5 Code, may not be placed on a renewable contract status, provided however, if
6 the career ladder pursuant to section 33-1004B, Idaho Code, is not funded,
7 then a professional endorsement shall not be required. Additionally, any
8 individual who has not successfully completed the three (3) year nontradi-
9 tional route program while on a three (3) year interim certificate and has
10 not yet been issued a five (5) year renewable certificate may not be placed on
11 a renewable contract. Such individual will remain on a category 3 contract,
12 even after serving three (3) continuous years of employment with the same
13 school district.
14 (2) At least once annually, the performance of each renewable contract
15 certificated employee, school nurse, or school librarian shall be evaluated
16 according to criteria and procedures established by the board of trustees in
17 accordance with general guidelines approved by the state board of education.
18 Such an evaluation shall be completed no later than June 1 of each year. The
19 evaluation shall include a minimum of two (2) documented observations, one
20 (1) of which shall be completed prior to January 1 of each year.
21 (3) Any contract automatically renewed under the provisions of this
22 section may be renewed for a shorter term, longer term or the same length
23 of term as stated in the current contract and at a greater, lesser or equal
24 salary as that stated in the current contract. Absent the board's applica-
25 tion of a formal reduction in force, renewals of standard teacher contracts
26 may be for a shorter term, longer term or the same length of term as stated
27 in the current standard teacher contract and at a greater, lesser or equal
28 salary, and shall be uniformly applied to all employees based upon the dis-
29 trict's adopted salary schedule to the extent allowable in section 33-1004E,
30 Idaho Code.
31 (a) Contracts issued pursuant to this section shall be issued on or be-
32 fore the first day of July each year.
33 (b) At the discretion of the board, the district may issue letters of
34 intent for employment for the next ensuing school year to renewable
35 contract status employees during May of each school year. Such let-
36 ter of intent shall not state a specific duration of the contract or
37 salary/benefits term for the next ensuing school year.
38 (c) Unless otherwise negotiated and ratified by both parties pursuant
39 to section 33-1271 et seq., Idaho Code, standard teacher renewals for
40 terms shorter in length than that stated in the current standard con-
41 tract of renewable certificated employees, should be considered and im-
42 plemented only after the district has determined that the salary-based
43 apportionment reimbursement that it estimates it will receive for the
44 ensuing school year is less than the sum the district would otherwise be
45 paying for salaries for certificated professional employees.
46 (4) Nothing in this section shall prevent the board of trustees from of-
47 fering a renewed contract increasing the salary of any certificated person,
48 or from reassigning an administrative employee to a nonadministrative posi-
49 tion with appropriate reduction of salary from the preexisting salary level.
50 In the event the board of trustees reassigns an administrative employee to a

15
1 nonadministrative position, the board shall give written notice to the em-
2 ployee that contains a statement of the reasons for the reassignment. The
3 employee, upon written request to the board, shall be entitled to an informal
4 review of that decision. The process and procedure for the informal review
5 shall be determined by the local board of trustees.
6 (5) Before a board of trustees can determine not to renew for reasons of
7 an unsatisfactory report of the performance of any certificated person whose
8 contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, such person shall be en-
9 titled to a reasonable period of probation. This period of probation shall
10 be preceded by a written notice from the board of trustees with reasons for
11 such probationary period and with provisions for adequate supervision and
12 evaluation of the person's performance during the probationary period. Such
13 period of probation shall not affect the person's renewable contract status.
14 Consideration of probationary status for certificated personnel is consid-
15 eration of the status of an employee within the meaning of section 74-206,
16 Idaho Code, and may be held in executive session. If the consideration re-
17 sults in probationary status, the individual on probation shall not be named
18 in the minutes of the meeting. A record of the decision shall be placed in the
19 teacher's personnel file.
20 (6) If the board of trustees takes action to immediately discharge
21 or discharge upon termination of the current contract a certificated per-
22 son whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, the action
23 of the board shall be consistent with the procedures specified in section
24 33-513(5), Idaho Code, and, furthermore, the board shall notify the employee
25 in writing whether there is just and reasonable cause not to renew the con-
26 tract or to reduce the salary of the affected employee, and, if so, what
27 reasons it relied upon in that determination.
28 (7) If the board of trustees takes action after the declaration of a fi-
29 nancial emergency pursuant to section 33-522, Idaho Code, and such action is
30 directed at more than one (1) certificated employee, and if mutually agreed
31 to by both parties, a single informal review shall be conducted. Without
32 mutual consent of both parties, the board of trustees shall use the follow-
33 ing procedure to conduct a single due process hearing within sixty-seven
34 (67) days of the declaration of financial emergency pursuant to section
35 33-522(2), Idaho Code, or on or before June 22, whichever shall occur first:
36 (a) The superintendent or any other duly authorized administrative of-
37 ficer of the school district may recommend the change in the length of
38 the term stated in the current contract or reduce the salary of any cer-
39 tificated employee by filing with the board of trustees written notice
40 specifying the purported reasons for such changes.
41 (b) Upon receipt of such notice, the board of trustees, acting through
42 its duly authorized administrative official, shall give the affected
43 employees written notice of the reductions and the recommendation of
44 the change in the length of the term stated in the current contract or
45 the reduction of salary, along with written notice of a hearing be-

6 the fund.
7 (2) The moneys in the fund shall be distributed by the state controller
8 to the state department of education by August 1 each year for the purpose of
9 construction or renovation of school facilities. The moneys shall be dis-
10 tributed by the state department of education to each school district, as
11 defined in section 33-1001(21)(22), Idaho Code, first as provided in sub-
12 section (7) of this section and then on a per-pupil basis using the average
13 daily attendance calculation provided in section 33-1003A, Idaho Code, for
14 each student in kindergarten through grade 12 at physical facilities that
15 are part of and on school grounds of the school district in which the student
16 is enrolled with verification, as needed, by the office of the state board
17 of education. Upon formal approval by the state board of education, a school
18 district may receive an exemption to the physical facility requirement pur-
19 suant to this subsection if the student would have attended a physical facil-
20 ity in the school district if not for a stated emergency. The state depart-
21 ment of education shall transfer the moneys by no later than August 31 each
22 year to each school district. Such moneys shall be used in place of property

25 Moneys in the fund must be used by a school district in the following order of
26 priority:

33 tions 33-804 and 33-804A, Idaho Code; and
34 (d) Any moneys that remain following the payments provided in para-
35 graphs (a) through (c) of this subsection may be: used for construction
36 of a new school facility, renovation, or maintenance needs; used to
37 secure and make payments on a new school facilities bond; or saved in
38 a reserve account by the school district for future school facility
39 needs. Uses of funds shall include regular and routine facilities
40 maintenance, including preventive maintenance, building repairs, and
41 building security, and periodic major facilities projects that involve
42 planning, design, construction, renovation, retrofitting, and replac-
43 ing of buildings and building systems, components, and features, as
44 well as site acquisition, site improvements, and new construction.
45 (3) The amount of moneys received by a school district pursuant to this
46 section must be deducted from a school levy that would otherwise have been
47 paid by property taxpayers. Such moneys may not be duplicated by the collec-
48 tion of property tax, and no property taxes may be collected in order to make
49 extra payments on expenses described in subsection (2) of this section in ex-
50 cess of required amounts.

2 rent year pursuant to this section in the certification of its budget in ac-
3 cordance with section 63-803, Idaho Code. Said amount must be subtracted
4 from the amount to be levied. The amount of moneys thereby saved from being
5 collected by a property tax levy shall be reported on each property tax no-
6 tice pursuant to section 63-902, Idaho Code.
7 (5) Each school district shall report annually to the state department
8 of education, in a manner prescribed by it, on the expenditure of moneys it
9 has received pursuant to this section. The state department of education
10 shall present the reports to the legislature each January.
11 (6) For the purposes of this section, the Idaho school for the deaf and
12 the blind shall be considered a school district and shall receive a distribu-
13 tion based on the average daily attendance of the school.
14 (7)(a) For state fiscal year 2025 only, any school district that would
15 have received support from the bond levy equalization support program
16 for a qualified bond passed prior to January 1, 2024, and for which prop-
17 erty taxes were levied in property tax year 2023 pursuant to the amount
18 intended by the bond shall receive a distribution of funds from the dis-
19 tribution provided under subsection (2) of this section of at least as
20 much as would have been provided through bond levy equalization support
21 on July 1, 2024.
22 (b) For state fiscal year 2026 only, any school district that would have
23 received support from the bond levy equalization support program for a
24 qualified bond passed prior to January 1, 2024, and for which property
25 taxes were levied in property tax year 2024 pursuant to the amount in-
26 tended by the bond shall receive a distribution of funds from the dis-
27 tribution provided under subsection (2) of this section of at least as
28 much as would have been provided through bond levy equalization support
29 on July 1, 2025.
30 (c) The state department of education may adjust distributions for re-
31 maining districts proportionally as necessary pursuant to this para-
32 graph. On and after July 1, 2024, school districts may use funds pro-
33 vided in this section and section 33-913, Idaho Code, to offset the bond
34 levy equalization support.

44 (b) The distribution shall be calculated by multiplying the following
45 two (2) factors, both of which shall be based on the most recent data
46 available in the state fiscal year coinciding with the distribution
47 calculation:

3 district in which the student is enrolled with verification, as
4 needed, by the office of the state board of education. Upon formal
5 approval by the state board of education, a school district may re-
6 ceive an exemption to the physical facility requirement pursuant
7 to this subsection if the student would have attended a physical
8 facility in the school district if not for a stated emergency; and
9 (ii) Calculate, together with the Idaho state building authority,
10 the total amount that a bond issuance would generate, based on the
11 amount established in section 63-3638(19), Idaho Code.
12 (c) In no case shall the amount awarded to any school district be less
13 than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) over the ten (10) year pe-
14 riod.

20 Excess funds shall be distributed proportionately according to the
21 factors established in paragraph (b) of this subsection to remaining
22 school districts that received initial allocations below forty million
23 dollars ($40,000,000). Any districts receiving reallocations under
24 this paragraph shall not exceed forty million dollars ($40,000,000).
25 (e) For the purposes of this section, the Idaho school for the deaf and
26 the blind shall be considered a school district and shall receive a dis-
27 tribution based on the average daily attendance of the school.
