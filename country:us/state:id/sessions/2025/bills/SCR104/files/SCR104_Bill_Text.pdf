7 Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
8 WHEREAS, the Nuremberg Code was established in 1947 in response to the
9 atrocities of nonconsensual and inhumane medical experiments conducted dur-
10 ing World War II, serving as the first international framework for ethical
11 medical and scientific research; and
12 WHEREAS, the Nuremberg Code sets forth the following essential princi-
13 ples:
14 (1) Voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential, re-
15 quiring individuals to have full knowledge of the nature, purpose, and
16 risks of the research and the freedom to participate without coercion.
17 (2) Research must yield results beneficial to society and not obtain-
18 able by other means, with all experiments grounded in sound scientific
19 methods.
20 (3) Unnecessary physical and mental suffering must be avoided, and no
21 experiment should proceed if it is likely to result in death or dis-
22 abling injury, except where the experimenter also serves as a subject.
23 (4) The degree of risk should never exceed the humanitarian importance
24 of the problem addressed by the research.
25 (5) Adequate safeguards and facilities must be in place to protect par-
26 ticipants, and research must be conducted by qualified and skilled pro-
27 fessionals.
28 (6) Participants must retain the right to withdraw from research at any
29 time, and researchers must terminate experiments if continuation is
30 likely to cause harm; and
31 WHEREAS, the Nuremberg Code remains the cornerstone of ethical re-
32 search practices and has influenced subsequent international declarations
33 and guidelines, including the World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration
34 of Helsinki, the Belmont Report, and the United Nations Educational, Sci-
35 entific, and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) Universal Declaration on
36 Bioethics and Human Rights; and
37 WHEREAS, the WMA Declaration of Helsinki reinforces the Nuremberg Code
38 by emphasizing informed consent, independent ethical oversight, and the
39 prioritization of participant welfare in research, particularly for vulner-
40 able populations; and
41 WHEREAS, the Belmont Report further complements the Nuremberg Code by
42 identifying the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice

2
1 as essential to ensuring fairness, autonomy, and the minimization of harm in
2 research practices; and
3 WHEREAS, UNESCO's bioethics and human rights framework highlights
4 the integration of human rights into ethical research, emphasizing trans-
5 parency, equity, solidarity, and responsibility toward future generations
6 as critical considerations in addressing modern scientific advancements;
7 and
8 WHEREAS, the State of Idaho is committed to safeguarding the health,
9 dignity, and rights of its citizens, upholding the ethical principles of
10 the Nuremberg Code while incorporating modern advancements to address the
11 complexities of contemporary medical and scientific research.
12 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
13 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Rep-
14 resentatives concurring therein, that the Idaho Legislature:
15 (1) Reaffirms the Nuremberg Code as the foundational framework for eth-
16 ical medical and scientific research, prioritizing the protection of
17 human rights and the principles of voluntary consent and the prevention
18 of harm;
19 (2) Recognizes the complementary contributions of the WMA Declara-
20 tion of Helsinki, the Belmont Report, and UNESCO's bioethics and human
21 rights framework in addressing modern ethical challenges while rein-
22 forcing the core principles of the Nuremberg Code;
23 (3) Urges all medical, academic, and research institutions within the
24 State of Idaho to strictly adhere to the Nuremberg Code and these com-
25 plementary guidelines, ensuring that all research involving human sub-
26 jects meets the highest ethical standards;
27 (4) Commits to reviewing and strengthening state laws and policies to
28 ensure compliance with the Nuremberg Code, particularly in areas of in-
29 formed consent, protection of vulnerable populations, and independent
30 ethical oversight; and
31 (5) Encourages the education of medical professionals, researchers,
32 and the public on the principles of the Nuremberg Code to foster a cul-
33 ture of ethical responsibility and respect for human dignity.
34 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that copies of this resolution be sent to Idaho
35 medical institutions, research organizations, and other relevant entities
