2 RELATING TO AERONAUTICS; AMENDING CHAPTER 5, TITLE 21, IDAHO CODE, BY THE
3 ADDITION OF A NEW SECTION 21-515B, IDAHO CODE, TO PROVIDE FOR LIGHT-MIT-
4 IGATING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS TO BE INSTALLED ON WIND ENERGY CONVERSION
5 SYSTEMS; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
6 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
7 SECTION 1. That Chapter 5, Title 21, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
8 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
9 ignated as Section 21-515B, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
10 21-515B. WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEMS -- LIGHT-MITIGATING TECHNOL-
11 OGY SYSTEMS. (1) On and after July 1, 2025, no new wind energy conversion
12 system shall commence commercial operations in this state unless the de-
13 veloper, owner, or operator of the wind energy conversion system applies to
14 the federal aviation administration for installation of a light-mitigat-
15 ing technology system that complies with federal aviation administration
16 regulations 14 CFR 1.1, et seq. If approved by the federal aviation admin-
17 istration, the developer, owner, or operator of such wind energy conversion
18 system shall install the light-mitigating technology system on approved
19 turbines within twenty-four (24) months after receipt of such approval.
20 (2) On and after January 1, 2026, any developer, owner, or operator of
21 a wind energy conversion system that has commenced commercial operations in
22 the state without a light-mitigating technology system shall apply to the
23 federal aviation administration for installation and operation of a light-
24 mitigating technology system that complies with federal aviation adminis-
25 tration regulations 14 CFR 1.1, et seq. If approved by the federal aviation
26 administration, the developer, owner, or operator of such wind energy con-
27 version system shall install the light-mitigating technology system on ap-
28 proved turbines within sixty (60) months following such approval.
29 (3) Any developer, owner, or operator who is required to apply to
30 install a light-mitigating technology system on a wind energy conversion
31 system pursuant to the requirements of this section and who is approved by
32 the federal aviation administration for such installation shall provide to
33 the Idaho transportation department division of aeronautics, in the form
34 and manner prescribed by the division, notice of the progress of the instal-
35 lation of such light-mitigating technology system. If the installation of
36 the light-mitigating technology system is delayed beyond a timeframe es-
37 tablished pursuant to this section, the developer, owner, or operator shall
38 provide notice to the Idaho transportation department division of aeronau-
39 tics not less than once every three (3) months to provide an update on the
40 reasons for the delay and the current status of the installation.
41 (4) Any costs associated with the installation, implementation, oper-
42 ation, and maintenance of a light-mitigating technology system shall be the
2
1 responsibility of the developer, owner, or operator of the wind energy con-
2 version system.
3 (5) As used in this section:
4 (a) "Light-mitigating technology system" means aircraft detection
5 lighting or any other comparable system capable of reducing the impact
6 of facility obstruction lighting while maintaining conspicuity suffi-
7 cient to assist aircraft in identifying and avoiding collision with a
8 wind energy conversion system.
9 (b) "Wind energy conversion system" means an electricity genera-
10 tion facility consisting of five (5) or more wind turbines that are
11 fifty (50) feet or taller in height and any accessory structures and
12 buildings, including substations, meteorological towers, electrical
13 infrastructure, transmission lines, and other appurtenant structures.
14 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
15 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after its
16 passage and approval.
