11 OGY SYSTEMS. (1) On and after July 1, 2025, no new wind energy conversion
12 system shall commence commercial operations in this state unless the de-
13 veloper, owner, or operator of the wind energy conversion system applies to
14 the federal aviation administration for installation of a light-mitigat-
15 ing technology system that complies with federal aviation administration
16 regulations 14 CFR 1.1, et seq. If approved by the federal aviation admin-
17 istration, the developer, owner, or operator of such wind energy conversion
18 system shall install the light-mitigating technology system on approved
19 turbines within twenty-four (24) months after receipt of such approval.
20 (2) On and after January 1, 2026, any developer, owner, or operator of
21 a wind energy conversion system that has commenced commercial operations in
22 the state without a light-mitigating technology system shall apply to the
23 federal aviation administration for installation and operation of a light-
24 mitigating technology system that complies with federal aviation adminis-
25 tration regulations 14 CFR 1.1, et seq. If approved by the federal aviation
26 administration, the developer, owner, or operator of such wind energy con-
27 version system shall install the light-mitigating technology system on ap-
28 proved turbines within twenty-four (24) months following such approval.
29 (3) Any developer, owner, or operator who is required to apply to
30 install a light-mitigating technology system on a wind energy conversion
31 system pursuant to the requirements of this section and who is approved by

1 (4) Any costs associated with the installation, implementation, oper-
2 ation, and maintenance of a light-mitigating technology system shall be the
3 responsibility of the developer, owner, or operator of the wind energy con-
4 version system.
5 (5) As used in this section:
6 (a) "Light-mitigating technology system" means aircraft detection
7 lighting or any other comparable system capable of reducing the impact
8 of facility obstruction lighting while maintaining conspicuity suffi-
9 cient to assist aircraft in identifying and avoiding collision with a
10 wind energy conversion system.
11 (b) "Wind energy conversion system" means an electricity genera-
12 tion facility consisting of five (5) or more wind turbines that are
13 fifty (50) feet or taller in height and any accessory structures and
14 buildings, including substations, meteorological towers, electrical
15 infrastructure, transmission lines, and other appurtenant structures.
16 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
