2 receive additional compensation for attending interim meetings, special
3 sessions, or organizational sessions; and
4 WHEREAS, the Idaho Legislature has the second-fewest number of support
5 staff per legislator of any western state, necessitating that legislators do
6 more work; and

8 mittee on Legislative Compensation, will help bridge the gap between leg-
9 islative compensation and compensation for other state employees; and
10 WHEREAS, some legislators have spoken out against the action taken by
11 the Citizens' Committee on Legislative Compensation and feel that the in-
12 creased compensation for legislative members is too much; and
13 WHEREAS, although the Citizens' Committee on Legislative Compensation
14 is authorized by the Constitution to establish the rate of compensation and
15 expenses for services to be rendered by members of the Legislature, indi-
16 vidual legislative members may donate all or a portion of their compensation
17 back to taxpayers of the State of Idaho by donating such compensation to the
18 Tax Relief Fund established in section 57-811, Idaho Code.
