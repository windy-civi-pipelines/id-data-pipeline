LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF IDAHO
IN THE SENATE
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 111
BY STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
1 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
2 STATING FINDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND RECOGNIZING MOTHER'S DAY THROUGH
3 FATHER'S DAY AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES
4 FACING TRADITIONAL FAMILIES AND THE ALARMING RATE AT WHICH THE TRADI-
5 TIONAL AMERICAN FAMILY IS DECLINING.
6 Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
7 WHEREAS, traditional families designed by God have been the foundation
8 of societies since creation. As such, traditional families operate as a
9 source of security in their communities, often attending to societal trou-
10 bles before law enforcement involvement is needed, thereby serving as the
11 cornerstone of a functional society. In a letter entitled The Crucial Role
12 of Families submitted to the United Nations by the International Federation
13 for Family Development in consult with the U.N. Economic and Social Council
14 division, the authors state: "Children growing up in healthy, married,
15 two-parent families are more likely to lead happy, healthy and successful
16 lives than those who have not experienced the same level of family security
17 and stability... Governments cannot afford to fully replace the functions
18 families perform for the benefit of their members and for the good of soci-
19 ety. The family is the most powerful, the most humane and, by far, the most
20 economical system known for building competence and character."; and
21 WHEREAS, the freedom to exercise these beliefs and values based in the
22 truth of the laws of nature and nature's God has been protected by the Consti-
23 tution of the United States since its inception; and
24 WHEREAS, the International Federation for Family Development has
25 stated: "As basic and essential building blocks of societies, families have
26 a crucial role in social development. They bear the primary responsibility
27 for the education and socialization of children as well as instilling values
28 of citizenship and belonging in the society."; and
29 WHEREAS, traditional families consisting of a natural mother and fa-
30 ther, children, grandparents, and extended family have declined drastically
31 since 1960 when approximately 77.5% of children lived with their two par-
32 ents, who were married; and
33 WHEREAS, according to census data, in 1960, just 13% of all households
34 were single-person households. In 2018, that figure was 28%; and
35 WHEREAS, today, only 17.8% of Americans live in traditional nuclear
36 families; and
37 WHEREAS, in 1950, 27% of marriages ended in divorce. Today, about 45%
38 do; and
39 WHEREAS, in 1960, 72% of Americans were married. In 2017, nearly half of
40 Americans were single; and
41 WHEREAS, in 1960, approximately 5% of children were born to unmarried
42 women. Now, about 40% are; and
2
1 WHEREAS, American children are more likely to live in a single-parent
2 household than children from any other country; and
3 WHEREAS, courageous single parents encounter unique and significant
4 struggles within our society, and families serve as an important support
5 structure to help them thrive despite their circumstances; and
6 WHEREAS, according to the International Federation for Family Develop-
7 ment, "Those who build stable families have a higher life expectancy, lower
8 risks of mental illness, alcoholism and domestic violence. The children
9 show lower infant mortality rate, lower risk drug addiction, and lower in-
10 cidences of engaging in criminal activities after puberty, higher academic
11 achievements, lower incidence of mental illnesses and fewer teenage un-
12 wanted pregnancies. A stable family is the lowest cost option for both its
13 members and the State."; and
14 WHEREAS, the people who suffer the most from the decline in traditional
15 family values and structure are the most vulnerable, especially children;
16 and
17 WHEREAS, those born into poverty and living with both parents have an
18 80% chance of climbing out of it. Those born into poverty with a single
19 mother have a 50% chance of remaining stuck in poverty; and
20 WHEREAS, even in high-crime, inner-city neighborhoods, well over 90%
21 of children from safe, stable homes do not become delinquents. By contrast,
22 only 10% of children from unsafe, unstable homes in these neighborhoods
23 avoid crime; and
24 WHEREAS, 63% of youth who commit suicide, 90% of all homeless or runaway
25 children, 85% of all children who show behavior disorders, 80% of rapists
26 with anger problems, 71% of all high school dropouts, 75% of all adolescent
27 patients in chemical abuse centers, and 85% of youths in prisons come from
28 fatherless homes; and
29 WHEREAS, research demonstrates children who grow up in families with
30 traditional values and gender roles are more likely to have traditional val-
31 ues and gender role expectations themselves; and
32 WHEREAS, there is an unprecedented attack on these beliefs and the cele-
33 bration of these beliefs; and
34 WHEREAS, much remains to be done to ensure that traditional family roles
35 and values are both celebrated and encouraged to provide the most nurturing
36 and healthy environment possible to raise the next generation of American
37 children.
38 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
39 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Rep-
40 resentatives concurring therein, that the Idaho Legislature:
41 (1) Supports the designation of Mother's Day through Father's Day as
42 Traditional Family Values Month in the State of Idaho;
43 (2) Recognizes the value of a traditional family consisting of the nat-
44 ural female mother and male father, children, aunts, uncles, grandparents,
45 and other extended family;
46 (3) Recognizes the first week of Traditional Family Values Month, in-
47 cluding Mother's Day, as a celebration of motherhood;
48 (4) Recognizes the second week of Traditional Family Values Month as a
49 celebration of sons, brothers, and uncles;
3
1 (5) Recognizes the third week of Traditional Family Values Month as a
2 celebration of grandparents;
3 (6) Recognizes the fourth week of Traditional Family Values Month as a
4 celebration of daughters, sisters, and aunts;
5 (7) Recognizes the fifth and final period of Traditional Family Values
6 Month, including Father's Day, as a celebration of fatherhood and marriage
7 between a man and a woman;
8 (8) Recognizes the evidence-based physical and mental health benefits
9 children receive when raised in a home with a traditional family;
10 (9) Recognizes the evidence-based results that children flourish when
11 raised in a home with an involved biological father;
12 (10) Recognizes the immeasurable benefits children receive in the de-
13 velopment of character, morality, virtue, and spirituality that traditional
14 American family values foster; and
15 (11) Encourages communities, schools, churches, businesses, corpora-
16 tions, and other stakeholders who all benefit from the cohesiveness, peace,
17 tranquility, and civility of communities built on strong traditional family
18 values, along with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare whose mission
19 is to strengthen the health, safety, and independence of Idahoans, to take
20 part in celebrating Traditional Family Values Month in the State of Idaho.
