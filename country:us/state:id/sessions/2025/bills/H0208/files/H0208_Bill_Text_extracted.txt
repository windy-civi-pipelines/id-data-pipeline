40 31-1423. LEVY -- RECOMMENDED LEVY -- ELECTION. (1) Each year, immedi-
41 ately prior to the annual county levy of taxes, the board of commissioners
42 of each fire protection district, organized and existing under this chapter,
43 may levy a tax upon all the taxable property within the boundaries of such
44 district sufficient to defray the cost of equipping and maintaining the dis-
45 trict of twenty-four hundredths percent (.24%) of market value for assess-
46 ment purposes, to be used for the purposes of this chapter and for no other
47 purpose. The levy shall be made by resolution entered upon the minutes of the
48 board of commissioners of the fire protection district, and it shall be the
49 duty of the secretary of the district, immediately after entry of the resolu-
3
1 tion in the minutes, to transmit to the county auditor and the county asses-
2 sor certified copies of the resolution providing for such levy. Said taxes
3 shall be collected as provided by section 63-812, Idaho Code.
4 (2)(a) If two (2) or more fire protection districts consolidate into
5 one (1) district, the provisions of section 63-802, Idaho Code, shall ap-
6 ply to the consolidated district's budget request as if the former district
7 which, in the year of the consolidation, has the higher levy subject to the
8 limitations of section 63-802, Idaho Code, had annexed the other district or
9 districts. In addition, the consolidated district shall receive the bene-
10 fit of foregone increases accumulated by the former districts under section
11 63-802(1)(a), Idaho Code.
12 (b) Provided however, that if the higher levy rate provided for in
13 subsection (2)(a) of this section exceeds the lowest levy rate of any
14 of the districts to be consolidated by more than three percent (3%),
15 the commissioners of the districts consolidating shall recommend, by
16 a majority of the commissioners of each district involved, at a public
17 hearing where a quorum of each district board is present, a levy rate
18 that falls between the highest levy rate and the lowest levy rate. In
19 determining such recommended levy rate, the commissioners shall recom-
20 mend a levy rate that shall be sufficient to defray the cost of equipping
21 and maintaining the new consolidated district. If such recommended
22 levy rate exceeds by more than three percent (3%) the lowest current
23 district levy rate of any of the districts to be consolidated, an elec-
24 tion shall be held in a manner consistent with the provisions of section
25 31-1414, Idaho Code. In such election, the electors residing in the
26 fire protection districts seeking to consolidate shall vote to approve
27 or disapprove the recommended levy rate and the proposed consolidation
28 of districts. The question put to the electors shall be the same or sim-
29 ilar to the question provided for in section 31-1414, Idaho Code, except
30 that the question shall include, in addition to the language described
31 in section 31-1414, Idaho Code, a reference to the recommended levy rate
32 provided for in this section and a reference to the percentage change

39 after, or which that shall change any existing boundaries hereafter, shall
40 cause one (1) copy of the legal description and map prepared in a draftsman-
41 like manner which that shall plainly and clearly designate the boundaries
42 of such district or municipality as formed or organized, or as altered,
43 to be recorded with the county recorder and filed with the county assessor
44 in the counties within which the unit is located, any taxing district with
45 taxing authority that will be affected by the formation or change in exist-
46 ing boundaries of such taxing district, and with the state tax commission
47 within thirty (30) days following the effective date of such formation,
48 organization or alteration but no later than the tenth day of January of
49 the year following such formation, organization or alteration. In the case
4
1 of fire protection districts, the board of county commissioners approving
2 the boundaries shall be responsible for delivering to the assessor, and
3 recorder, and any affected fire protection districts the map and legal de-
4 scription of the amended district boundaries. Formation, organization or
5 alteration documents that are filed pursuant to this section shall include
6 contact information that is current at the time of filing and that identifies
7 an individual associated with the taxing district.
8 (2) Urban renewal agencies shall comply with the requirements of sub-
9 section (1) of this section when a revenue allocation area within the juris-
10 diction of the urban renewal agency is formed or when the boundaries of such
11 an area are altered.
12 (3) The state tax commission shall review filings required by subsec-
13 tions (1) and (2) of this section and, if the commission finds that the for-
14 mation of a district or a change in a district's boundaries fails to provide
15 a proper legal description or fails to correctly identify the boundaries,
16 the state tax commission shall notify the affected taxing authority within
17 twenty-eight (28) days after receiving the original request. The notifica-
18 tion shall list any errors or omissions in the submitted map and legal de-
19 scription along with any possible remedies to correct said errors or omis-
20 sions. The taxing authority shall be provided an additional twenty-eight
21 (28) days after receiving the requested change from the state tax commis-
22 sion to provide a corrected map and legal description. If the corrected map
23 and legal description fail to correctly identify the boundaries or change
24 of boundaries of the taxing district, as was listed in the state tax commis-
25 sion's notification, then the state tax commission may direct that the for-
26 mation or change not be recognized for property tax purposes. The state tax
27 commission's review shall not include matters relating to notice, open meet-
28 ings law requirements, or compliance with provisions in Idaho law not relat-
29 ing to boundaries.
30 (4) The county assessor, county auditor and state tax commission shall
31 retain on file in their respective offices all copies of legal descriptions
32 of taxing district boundaries and maps filed by the various taxing jurisdic-
33 tions authorized to impose a levy on property.
34 (5) The state tax commission shall be responsible for providing copies
35 of uniform tax code area numbers and maps to the county assessor, county au-
36 ditor and county treasurer and various companies having operating property
37 subject to assessment in the state of Idaho and under the jurisdiction of the
38 state tax commission for assessment and taxation purposes.
39 (6) Unless otherwise specifically authorized to form with noncontigu-
40 ous boundaries, or to annex or deannex properties so as to make noncontigu-
41 ous boundaries, all taxing districts shall form with and maintain contiguous
42 boundaries.
43 SECTION 4. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
44 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
45 July 1, 2025.

1 of fire protection districts, the board of county commissioners approving
2 the boundaries shall be responsible for delivering to the assessor, and
3 recorder, and any affected fire protection districts the map and legal de-
4 scription of the amended district boundaries. Formation, organization or
5 alteration documents that are filed pursuant to this section shall include
6 contact information that is current at the time of filing and that identifies
7 an individual associated with the taxing district.

9 section (1) of this section when a revenue allocation area within the juris-
10 diction of the urban renewal agency is formed or when the boundaries of such
11 an area are altered.
12 (3) The state tax commission shall review filings required by subsec-
13 tions (1) and (2) of this section and, if the commission finds that the for-
14 mation of a district or a change in a district's boundaries fails to provide
15 a proper legal description or fails to correctly identify the boundaries,
16 the state tax commission shall notify the affected taxing authority within
17 twenty-eight (28) days after receiving the original request. The notifica-
18 tion shall list any errors or omissions in the submitted map and legal de-
19 scription along with any possible remedies to correct said errors or omis-
20 sions. The taxing authority shall be provided an additional twenty-eight
21 (28) days after receiving the requested change from the state tax commis-
22 sion to provide a corrected map and legal description. If the corrected map
23 and legal description fail to correctly identify the boundaries or change
24 of boundaries of the taxing district, as was listed in the state tax commis-
25 sion's notification, then the state tax commission may direct that the for-
26 mation or change not be recognized for property tax purposes. The state tax
27 commission's review shall not include matters relating to notice, open meet-
28 ings law requirements, or compliance with provisions in Idaho law not relat-
29 ing to boundaries.
30 (4) The county assessor, county auditor and state tax commission shall

37 subject to assessment in the state of Idaho and under the jurisdiction of the
38 state tax commission for assessment and taxation purposes.
39 (6) Unless otherwise specifically authorized to form with noncontigu-

41 ous boundaries, all taxing districts shall form with and maintain contiguous
42 boundaries.
