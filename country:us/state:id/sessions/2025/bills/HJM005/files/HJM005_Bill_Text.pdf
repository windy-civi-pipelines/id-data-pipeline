Sixty-eighth Legislature First Regular Session - 2025
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
HOUSE JOINT MEMORIAL NO. 5
BY ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE
1 A JOINT MEMORIAL
2 TO THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES IN CON-
3 GRESS ASSEMBLED, TO THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION REPRESENTING THE
4 STATE OF IDAHO IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, AND TO THE PRESIDENT
5 OF THE UNITED STATES.
6 We, your Memorialists, the House of Representatives and the Senate of
7 the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Sixty-eighth
8 Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that:
9 WHEREAS, the Bureau of Land Management has issued a record of decision
10 (ROD) approving the Lava Ridge Wind Energy Project, which entails leasing an
11 extensive amount of public land in Jerome, Lincoln, and Minidoka Counties;
12 and
13 WHEREAS, President Trump recently issued an executive order directing
14 that federal leasing and permitting practices for wind energy projects be
15 reviewed; and
16 WHEREAS, the State of Idaho concurs with the executive order's state-
17 ment that the Lava Ridge project is "contrary to the public interest and suf-
18 fers from legal deficiencies"; and
19 WHEREAS, Governor Brad Little has stated that "this project has faced
20 overwhelming opposition from Idaho residents and elected officials over its
21 permanent impact on multiple uses, cultural and historical sites, including
22 the Minidoka National Historic Site, wildlife, and local economies"; and
23 WHEREAS, Attorney General Ra√∫l Labrador has stated that the "proposal
24 has widespread opposition in Idaho from very diverse groups who don't want
25 massive turbines sprouting up in the Magic Valley"; and
26 WHEREAS, the construction and operation of 231 wind turbines, each with
27 heights of up to 660 feet will impact civil, military, and agricultural
28 flight operations; and
29 WHEREAS, because the Magic Valley currently has a shortage of available
30 housing, workforce, and construction capacity, the economy cannot offer the
31 temporary support needed to construct Lava Ridge over the proposed two-year
32 construction period and doing so will further stress local markets and lead
33 to a boom-and-bust economy, a concern which has been rightfully and vehe-
34 mently expressed by local citizens and business; and
35 WHEREAS, the blasting occurring during construction could signifi-
36 cantly damage the fragile subsurface geology containing the Snake River
37 Aquifer, the life blood of Southern Idaho; and
38 WHEREAS, Idaho is required by law to protect all wildlife and this
39 project will severely impact the migration and habitat of local wildlife;
40 and
41 WHEREAS, the lands subject to development under this project are uti-
42 lized by the agriculture industry and the public for recreational activities
43 such as hunting and fishing; and

2
1 WHEREAS, the State of Idaho will derive little to no benefit from this
2 project; and
3 WHEREAS, the energy created by the Lava Ridge project will provide en-
4 ergy to Southern Nevada and California, both of which have tremendous open
5 space that could accommodate this project and more directly move the impacts
6 to the beneficiaries; and
7 WHEREAS, President Trump's executive order does not prohibit construc-
8 tion of the project but directs the Secretary of the Interior to place a tem-
9 porary moratorium on the ROD and to conduct a new, comprehensive analysis of
10 various impacts if the Secretary deems either of those actions to be appro-
11 priate.
12 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
13 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and
14 the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature opposes the Lava Ridge
15 project and respectfully requests federal intervention to permanently pro-
16 hibit the project.
17 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chief Clerk of the House of Representa-
18 tives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this
19 Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Rep-
20 resentatives of Congress, to the congressional delegation representing the
21 State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States, and to the President of
22 the United States.
