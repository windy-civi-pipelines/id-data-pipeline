LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF IDAHO
Sixty-eighth Legislature First Regular Session - 2025
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 2
BY STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
1 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
2 STATING FINDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND HONORING AND COMMENDING THE BOISE
3 STATE UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM FOR ITS COURAGE AND COMMITMENT
4 IN STANDING STRONGLY FOR THE INTEGRITY OF WOMEN'S SPORTS BY KEEPING
5 WOMEN'S SPORTS FOR WOMEN ONLY IN ALIGNMENT WITH IDAHO'S FAIRNESS IN
6 WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT AND GOVERNOR LITTLE'S EXECUTIVE ORDER.
7 Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
8 WHEREAS, participation in sports has played an important role in the
9 lives of young girls everywhere by improving their physical, emotional,
10 and psychological health, their self-confidence, and their discipline, and
11 for a select few, women's sports provide a path for a future in collegiate
12 sports; and
13 WHEREAS, the enactment of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,
14 designed to prohibit sex-based discrimination, marked a pivotal moment in
15 federal support for women in sports that applied to most postsecondary in-
16 stitutions receiving federal financial assistance; and
17 WHEREAS, prior to Title IX, one in 27 girls participated in high school
18 sports, but today two in five girls participate in high school sports. This
19 has led to a 990% increase in the number of girls playing high school sports
20 and a 545% increase in the number of women playing college sports; and
21 WHEREAS, the Boise State University women's volleyball team took a
22 stand for women and to protect women's sports on the basis of sex by for-
23 feiting matches against the San Jose State University women's volleyball
24 team that included a biological male on its roster on September 28, 2024, and
25 November 21, 2024. The team exhibited integrity and remained true to its
26 principles by deciding again to forfeit its match at the 2024 Mountain West
27 Women's Volleyball Tournament against San Jose State; and
28 WHEREAS, in 2010 the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)
29 adopted a policy on transgender student-athlete participation that contin-
30 ues today and disproportionately affects female athletes.
31 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
32 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and
33 the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature commends the Boise State
34 University women's volleyball team for its principled stand in defending the
35 integrity of women's athletics; recognizes the players' courage in uphold-
36 ing fairness in competition; and reaffirms Idaho's commitment to protecting
37 female athletes under Title IX, the Idaho Fairness in Women's Sports Act,
38 and Governor Little's Executive Order 2024-08, which demonstrate Idaho's
39 unwavering dedication to preserving fairness, equality, and the integrity
40 of women's sports.
41 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature calls on the Mountain West
42 Conference to correct its regressive policy of allowing biological men in
43 women's sports and to return to the original intent of Title IX, and to cor-

2
1 rect the Boise State University women's volleyball team record, as well as
2 all other schools' records in the conference, to reflect all forfeits as "no
3 contests" rather than losses.
4 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature calls on the NCAA to revoke
5 its transgender student-athlete participation policy, which directly dis-
6 criminates against female student athletes in collegiate women's sports and
7 ultimately placed the Boise State University women's volleyball team in this
8 position; reminds the NCAA that President-elect Donald J. Trump has com-
9 mitted to restore protections for women and girls in women's sports when he
10 takes office, and a failure to change these regressive policies would place
11 states in direct conflict with the federal government; and calls for the
12 NCAA President, Charlie Baker, to acknowledge the directive to the NCAA from
13 the 25 states that have passed legislation protecting fairness in women's
14 sports. It is not necessary for the federal government to take action first
15 as the states and the people have spoken and it is time for the NCAA to do the
16 right thing.
17 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chief Clerk of the House of Represen-
18 tatives be, and is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this
19 Resolution to the following: the President of Boise State University, the
20 Director of Athletics at Boise State University, the head coach of the Boise
21 State University women's volleyball team, the members of the Boise State
22 women's volleyball team, the Idaho State Board of Education, the President
23 of the NCAA, the Chair of the NCAA Board of Governors, the Commissioner of the
24 Mountain West Conference, and anyone else deemed appropriate.
