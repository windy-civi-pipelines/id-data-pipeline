14 amended to read as follows:
15 16-1622. REVIEW HEARINGS -- STATUS HEARINGS -- ANNUAL PERMANENCY
16 HEARINGS. (1) Review hearing.
17 (a) A hearing for review of the child's case and permanency plan shall
18 be held no later than six (6) months after entry of the court's order
19 taking jurisdiction under this act and every six (6) months thereafter.
20 The department and the guardian ad litem shall file reports to the court
21 no later than five (5) days prior to the six (6) month review hearing.
22 The purpose of the review hearing is:
23 (i) To determine:
24 1. The safety of the child;
25 2. The continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the
26 placement;
27 3. The extent of compliance with the case plan; and
28 4. The extent of progress that has been made toward alle-
29 viating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement in
30 foster care;
31 (ii) To determine or continue to investigate whether the child is
32 an Indian child. If there is reason to believe that the child is an
33 Indian child and there has not been a final determination regard-
34 ing the child's status as an Indian child:
35 1. The department shall document and the court shall inquire
36 about the efforts that have been made since the last hearing
37 to determine whether the child is an Indian child; and
38 2. The department shall document and the court shall de-
39 termine that the department is using active efforts to work
40 with all tribes of which the child may be a member to verify
41 whether the child is a member or eligible for membership;
2
1 (iii) To inquire regarding the child's educational stability. The
2 department shall document and the court shall inquire as to the ef-
3 forts made to ensure educational stability for the child, includ-
4 ing the efforts made to keep the child in the school in which the
5 child is enrolled at the time of placement or the reason that re-
6 maining in the school is not in the child's best interests;
7 (iv) To inquire regarding sibling placement. The department
8 shall document and the court shall inquire whether siblings were
9 placed together or, if siblings were not placed together, the
10 efforts made to place siblings together, the reasons why sib-
11 lings were not placed together, and a plan for ensuring frequent
12 visitation or ongoing interaction between the siblings, unless
13 visitation or ongoing interaction would be contrary to the safety
14 or well-being of one (1) or more of the siblings;
15 (v) To inquire regarding permanency. The court shall ask each
16 youth age twelve (12) years and older about his desired permanency
17 outcome and discuss with the youth his current permanency plan.
18 For a youth age fourteen (14) years and older, the hearing shall
19 include a review of the services needed to assist the youth to make
20 the transition from foster care to successful adulthood;
21 (vi) To document efforts related to the reasonable and prudent
22 parent standard. For a youth whose permanency goal is another
23 planned permanent living arrangement, the department shall docu-
24 ment:
25 1. That the youth's foster parents or child care institution
26 is following the reasonable and prudent parent standard when
27 deciding whether the child may participate in extracurricu-
28 lar, enrichment, cultural and social activities; and
29 2. The regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age- or
30 developmentally appropriate activities that have been pro-
31 vided to the youth;
32 (vii) To document efforts made to find a permanent placement other
33 than another planned permanent living arrangement. For a youth
34 whose permanency goal is another planned permanent living ar-
35 rangement, the department shall document:
36 1. The intensive, ongoing, and, as of the date of the hear-
37 ing, unsuccessful efforts made to place the youth with a par-
38 ent, in an adoptive placement, in a guardianship, or in the
39 legal custody of the department in a placement with a fit and
40 willing relative, including an adult sibling; and
41 2. Why another planned permanent living arrangement is the
42 best permanency plan for the youth and a compelling reason
43 why, as of the date of the review hearing, it would not be in
44 the best interest of the child to be placed permanently with
45 a parent, in an adoptive placement, in a guardianship, or in
46 the legal custody of the department in a placement with a fit
47 and willing relative, including an adult sibling;
48 (viii) To make findings regarding a permanency goal of another
49 planned permanent living arrangement. For youth whose permanency
50 goal is another planned permanent living arrangement, the court
3
1 shall make written, case-specific findings, as of the date of the
2 hearing, that:
3 1. Another planned permanent living arrangement is the best
4 permanency goal for the youth; and
5 2. There are compelling reasons why it is not in the best in-
6 terest of the youth to be placed permanently with a parent,
7 in an adoptive placement, in a guardianship, or in the legal
8 custody of the department in a placement with a fit and will-
9 ing relative, including an adult sibling;
10 (ix) To document and inquire regarding psychotropic medication.
11 At each review hearing, if the child is being treated with psy-
12 chotropic medication, these additional requirements shall apply:
13 1. The department shall report to the court the medication
14 and dosage prescribed for the child and the medical profes-
15 sional who prescribed the medication; and
16 2. The court shall inquire as to, and may make any additional
17 inquiry relevant to, the use of psychotropic medication; and
18 (x) To project, when reasonable, a likely date by which the child
19 may be safely returned to and maintained in the home or placed in
20 another permanent placement.
21 (b) A status hearing is a review hearing that does not address all or
22 most of the purposes identified in paragraph (a) of this subsection and
23 may be held at the discretion of the court. Neither the department nor
24 the guardian ad litem is required to file a report with the court prior
25 to a status hearing, unless ordered otherwise by the court.
26 (c) A motion for revocation or modification of an order issued un-
27 der section 16-1619, Idaho Code, may be filed by the department or any
28 party; provided that no motion may be filed by the respondents under
29 this section within three (3) months of a prior hearing on care and
30 placement of the child. Notice of a motion for review of a child's case
31 shall be provided to the parents and other legal guardians, the prose-
32 cuting attorney or deputy attorney general, the guardian ad litem, the
33 attorney for the child, the department and foster parents.
34 (d) If the motion filed under paragraph (c) of this subsection alleges
35 that the child's best interests are no longer served by carrying out the
36 order issued under section 16-1619, Idaho Code, or that the department
37 or other authorized agency has failed to provide adequate care for the
38 child, the court shall hold a hearing on the motion.
39 (e) The department or authorized agency may move the court at any time
40 to vacate any order placing a child in its custody or under its protec-
41 tive supervision.
42 (2) Permanency plan and hearing.
43 (a) The permanency plan shall include a permanency goal. The per-
44 manency goal may be one (1) of the following: continued efforts at
45 reunification, in the absence of a judicial determination of aggra-
46 vated circumstances; or termination of parental rights and adoption,
47 guardianship or, for youth age sixteen (16) years and older only, an-
48 other planned permanent living arrangement. Every permanency plan
49 shall include the information set forth in section 16-1621(3)(a) and
50 (b), Idaho Code. If the permanency plan has reunification as a per-
4
1 manency goal, the plan shall include information set forth in section
2 16-1621(3)(c), Idaho Code; however, if the circumstances that caused
3 the child to be placed into protective custody resulted in a conviction
4 for lewd and lascivious conduct or felony injury to a child, if the child
5 has been in protective custody for more than six (6) months, or if a
6 high risk of repeat maltreatment or reentry into foster care exists due
7 to a parent's recent completion of substance abuse treatment or other
8 compelling circumstances, then the permanency plan shall include a
9 period of protective supervision or trial home visit period of no less
10 than ninety (90) days prior to the court vacating the case. During the
11 protective supervision or trial home visit period, the department shall
12 make regular home visits. During the protective supervision or trial
13 home visit period, the court shall hold one (1) or more review hearings
14 for each permanency plan where a period of protective supervision or a
15 trial home visit has been imposed and may require participation in sup-
16 portive services, including community home visiting and peer-to-peer
17 mentoring. Families reunified following a period of protective super-
18 vision or a trial home visit should be encouraged by the department or
19 the court to continue to participate in supportive services when ben-
20 eficial and appropriate. If the permanency plan has a permanency goal
21 other than reunification, the plan shall include the information set
22 forth in section 16-1621(3)(d), Idaho Code, and if the permanency goal
23 is termination of parental rights and adoption, then in addition to the
24 information set forth in section 16-1620(3), Idaho Code, the permanency
25 plan shall also name the proposed adoptive parents when known. If the
26 adoptive parents are not known at the time the permanency plan is pre-
27 pared, then the department shall amend the plan to name the proposed
28 adoptive parents as soon as such person or persons become known. The
29 court may approve a permanency plan that includes a primary goal and a
30 concurrent goal. As used in this paragraph, "trial home visit" means
31 that a child is returned to the care of the parent or guardian from whom
32 the child was removed with the department continuing to have legal cus-
33 tody of the child.
34 (b) A permanency hearing shall be held no later than twelve (12) months
35 from the date the child is removed from the home or the date of the
36 court's order taking jurisdiction under this chapter, whichever occurs
37 first, and at least every twelve (12) months thereafter, as long as the
38 court has jurisdiction over the child. The court shall approve, reject
39 or modify the permanency plan of the department and review progress in
40 accomplishing the permanency goal. The permanency plan, as approved by
41 the court, shall be entered into the record as an order of the court. A
42 permanency hearing may be held at any time and may be combined with the
43 review hearing required under subsection (1) of this section.
44 (c) The court shall make written, case-specific findings whether the
45 department made reasonable efforts to finalize the primary permanency
46 goal in effect for the child. Lack of reasonable efforts to reunify may
47 be a basis for an order approving a permanency plan with a permanency
48 goal of reunification.
49 (d) Where the permanency goal is not reunification, the hearing shall
50 include a review of the department's consideration of options for
5
1 in-state and out-of-state placement of the child. In the case of a
2 child in an out-of-state placement, the court shall determine whether
3 the out-of-state placement continues to be appropriate and in the best
4 interest of the child.
5 (e) The court shall ask each youth age twelve (12) years and older about
6 his desired permanency outcome and discuss with the youth his current
7 permanency plan. In the case of a child who has attained the age of four-
8 teen (14) years and older, the hearing shall include a determination of
9 the services needed to assist the youth to make the transition from fos-
10 ter care to successful adulthood.
11 (f) The court may approve a primary permanency goal of another planned
12 permanent living arrangement only for youth age sixteen (16) years or
13 older and only upon written, case-specific findings that, as of the date
14 of the hearing:
15 (i) Another planned permanent living arrangement is the best per-
16 manency goal for the youth; and
17 (ii) There are compelling reasons why it is not in the best inter-
18 est of the youth to be placed permanently with a parent, in an adop-
19 tive placement, in a guardianship, or in the legal custody of the
20 department in a placement with a fit and willing relative, includ-
21 ing an adult sibling.
22 (g) If the child has been in the temporary or legal custody of the de-
23 partment for fifteen (15) of the most recent twenty-two (22) months, the
24 department shall file, prior to the last day of the fifteenth month, a
25 petition to terminate parental rights, unless the court finds that:
26 (i) The child is placed permanently with a relative;
27 (ii) There are compelling reasons why termination of parental
28 rights is not in the best interests of the child; or
29 (iii) The department has failed to provide reasonable efforts to
30 reunify the child with his family.
31 (h) The department shall document and the court shall inquire:
32 (i) As to the efforts made to ensure educational stability for the
33 child, including the efforts made to keep the child in the school
34 in which the child is enrolled at the time of placement or that re-
35 maining in the school is not in the child's best interests; and
36 (ii) That siblings were placed together, or, if siblings were not
37 placed together, the efforts made to place siblings together, the
38 reasons why siblings were not placed together or why a joint place-
39 ment would be contrary to the safety or well-being of one (1) or
40 more of the siblings, and a plan for ensuring frequent visitation
41 or ongoing interaction among siblings, unless visitation or ongo-
42 ing interaction would be contrary to the safety or well-being of
43 one (1) or more of the siblings.
44 (i) If there is reason to believe that the child is an Indian child and
45 there has not been a final determination regarding the child's status as
46 an Indian child, the department shall document and the court shall:
47 (i) Inquire about the efforts that have been made since the last
48 hearing to determine whether the child is an Indian child; and
6
1 (ii) Determine that the department has made active efforts to work
2 with all tribes of which the child may be a member to verify whether
3 the child is a member or eligible for membership.
4 (j) At each permanency hearing, if the child is being treated with psy-
5 chotropic medication, these additional requirements shall apply:
6 (i) The department shall report to the court the medication and
7 dosage prescribed for the child and the medical professional who
8 prescribed the medication; and
9 (ii) The court shall inquire as to, and may make any additional
10 inquiry relevant to, the use of psychotropic medication.
11 (k) The court may authorize the department to suspend further efforts
12 to reunify the child with the child's parent, pending further order of
13 the court, when a permanency plan is approved by the court and the perma-
14 nency plan does not include a permanency goal of reunification.
15 (3) If a youth is in the legal custody of the department or other autho-
16 rized agency and is within ninety (90) days of his eighteenth birthday, the
17 department shall file a report with the court that includes the department's
18 transition plan for the youth. The court shall have a review or permanency
19 hearing at which the court shall:
20 (a) Discuss with the youth his or her transition plan; and
21 (b) Review the transition plan with the youth for purposes of ensur-
22 ing that the plan provides the services necessary to allow the youth to
23 transition to a successful adulthood.
24 (4) If a child is in the legal custody of the department and the court
25 has approved placement of the child in a qualified residential treatment
26 program, then at each review hearing pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this
27 section and at each permanency hearing pursuant to subsection (2)(b) of this
28 section the department shall document:
29 (a) That ongoing assessment of the strengths and needs of the child con-
30 tinues to support the determination that the needs of the child cannot
31 be met through placement in a foster family home, that the placement in
32 a qualified residential treatment program provides the most effective
33 and appropriate level of care for the child that is in the least restric-
34 tive environment, and that the placement is consistent with the short-
35 term and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency
36 plan for the child;
37 (b) The specific treatment or service needs that will be met for the
38 child in the placement and the length of time the child is expected to
39 need the treatment or services; and
40 (c) The efforts made by the department to prepare the child to return
41 home or to be placed with a fit and willing relative, a legal guardian,
42 or an adoptive parent or in a foster family home.
43 (5) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the court may
44 order extended foster care for a person between the ages of eighteen (18) and
45 twenty-one (21) twenty-three (23) years to help such person achieve a suc-
46 cessful transition to adulthood, provided such person must have been in the
47 custody of the department until his eighteenth birthday and must meet the
48 criteria set forth in 42 U.S.C. 675(8)(B)(iv). The extension shall be for
49 a fixed period of time and shall not extend past the person's twenty-first
50 twenty-third birthday.

10 AND OF NO FORCE AND EFFECT; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND PROVIDING AN
11 EFFECTIVE DATE.
12 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
13 SECTION 1. That Section 16-1622, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
14 amended to read as follows:
15 16-1622. REVIEW HEARINGS -- STATUS HEARINGS -- ANNUAL PERMANENCY
16 HEARINGS. (1) Review hearing.
17 (a) A hearing for review of the child's case and permanency plan shall
18 be held no later than six (6) months after entry of the court's order
19 taking jurisdiction under this act and every six (6) months thereafter.
20 The department and the guardian ad litem shall file reports to the court
21 no later than five (5) days prior to the six (6) month review hearing.
22 The purpose of the review hearing is:
23 (i) To determine:
24 1. The safety of the child;
25 2. The continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the
26 placement;
27 3. The extent of compliance with the case plan; and
28 4. The extent of progress that has been made toward alle-
29 viating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement in
30 foster care;
31 (ii) To determine or continue to investigate whether the child is
32 an Indian child. If there is reason to believe that the child is an
33 Indian child and there has not been a final determination regard-
34 ing the child's status as an Indian child:
35 1. The department shall document and the court shall inquire
36 about the efforts that have been made since the last hearing
37 to determine whether the child is an Indian child; and
38 2. The department shall document and the court shall de-
39 termine that the department is using active efforts to work
40 with all tribes of which the child may be a member to verify
41 whether the child is a member or eligible for membership;

2
1 (iii) To inquire regarding the child's educational stability. The
2 department shall document and the court shall inquire as to the ef-
3 forts made to ensure educational stability for the child, includ-
4 ing the efforts made to keep the child in the school in which the
5 child is enrolled at the time of placement or the reason that re-
6 maining in the school is not in the child's best interests;
7 (iv) To inquire regarding sibling placement. The department
8 shall document and the court shall inquire whether siblings were
9 placed together or, if siblings were not placed together, the
10 efforts made to place siblings together, the reasons why sib-
11 lings were not placed together, and a plan for ensuring frequent
12 visitation or ongoing interaction between the siblings, unless
13 visitation or ongoing interaction would be contrary to the safety
14 or well-being of one (1) or more of the siblings;
15 (v) To inquire regarding permanency. The court shall ask each
16 youth age twelve (12) years and older about his desired permanency
17 outcome and discuss with the youth his current permanency plan.
18 For a youth age fourteen (14) years and older, the hearing shall
19 include a review of the services needed to assist the youth to make
20 the transition from foster care to successful adulthood;
21 (vi) To document efforts related to the reasonable and prudent
22 parent standard. For a youth whose permanency goal is another
23 planned permanent living arrangement, the department shall docu-
24 ment:
25 1. That the youth's foster parents or child care institution
26 is following the reasonable and prudent parent standard when
27 deciding whether the child may participate in extracurricu-
28 lar, enrichment, cultural and social activities; and
29 2. The regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age- or
30 developmentally appropriate activities that have been pro-
31 vided to the youth;
32 (vii) To document efforts made to find a permanent placement other
33 than another planned permanent living arrangement. For a youth
34 whose permanency goal is another planned permanent living ar-
35 rangement, the department shall document:
36 1. The intensive, ongoing, and, as of the date of the hear-
37 ing, unsuccessful efforts made to place the youth with a par-
38 ent, in an adoptive placement, in a guardianship, or in the
39 legal custody of the department in a placement with a fit and
40 willing relative, including an adult sibling; and
41 2. Why another planned permanent living arrangement is the
42 best permanency plan for the youth and a compelling reason
43 why, as of the date of the review hearing, it would not be in
44 the best interest of the child to be placed permanently with
45 a parent, in an adoptive placement, in a guardianship, or in
46 the legal custody of the department in a placement with a fit
47 and willing relative, including an adult sibling;
48 (viii) To make findings regarding a permanency goal of another
49 planned permanent living arrangement. For youth whose permanency
50 goal is another planned permanent living arrangement, the court

3
1 shall make written, case-specific findings, as of the date of the
2 hearing, that:
3 1. Another planned permanent living arrangement is the best
4 permanency goal for the youth; and
5 2. There are compelling reasons why it is not in the best in-
6 terest of the youth to be placed permanently with a parent,
7 in an adoptive placement, in a guardianship, or in the legal
8 custody of the department in a placement with a fit and will-
9 ing relative, including an adult sibling;
10 (ix) To document and inquire regarding psychotropic medication.
11 At each review hearing, if the child is being treated with psy-
12 chotropic medication, these additional requirements shall apply:
13 1. The department shall report to the court the medication
14 and dosage prescribed for the child and the medical profes-
15 sional who prescribed the medication; and
16 2. The court shall inquire as to, and may make any additional
17 inquiry relevant to, the use of psychotropic medication; and
18 (x) To project, when reasonable, a likely date by which the child
19 may be safely returned to and maintained in the home or placed in
20 another permanent placement.
21 (b) A status hearing is a review hearing that does not address all or
22 most of the purposes identified in paragraph (a) of this subsection and
23 may be held at the discretion of the court. Neither the department nor
24 the guardian ad litem is required to file a report with the court prior
25 to a status hearing, unless ordered otherwise by the court.
26 (c) A motion for revocation or modification of an order issued un-
27 der section 16-1619, Idaho Code, may be filed by the department or any
28 party; provided that no motion may be filed by the respondents under
29 this section within three (3) months of a prior hearing on care and
30 placement of the child. Notice of a motion for review of a child's case
31 shall be provided to the parents and other legal guardians, the prose-
32 cuting attorney or deputy attorney general, the guardian ad litem, the
33 attorney for the child, the department and foster parents.
34 (d) If the motion filed under paragraph (c) of this subsection alleges
35 that the child's best interests are no longer served by carrying out the
36 order issued under section 16-1619, Idaho Code, or that the department
37 or other authorized agency has failed to provide adequate care for the
38 child, the court shall hold a hearing on the motion.
39 (e) The department or authorized agency may move the court at any time
40 to vacate any order placing a child in its custody or under its protec-
41 tive supervision.
42 (2) Permanency plan and hearing.
43 (a) The permanency plan shall include a permanency goal. The per-
44 manency goal may be one (1) of the following: continued efforts at
45 reunification, in the absence of a judicial determination of aggra-
46 vated circumstances; or termination of parental rights and adoption,
47 guardianship or, for youth age sixteen (16) years and older only, an-
48 other planned permanent living arrangement. Every permanency plan
49 shall include the information set forth in section 16-1621(3)(a) and
50 (b), Idaho Code. If the permanency plan has reunification as a per-

4
1 manency goal, the plan shall include information set forth in section
2 16-1621(3)(c), Idaho Code; however, if the circumstances that caused
3 the child to be placed into protective custody resulted in a conviction
4 for lewd and lascivious conduct or felony injury to a child, if the child
5 has been in protective custody for more than six (6) months, or if a
6 high risk of repeat maltreatment or reentry into foster care exists due
7 to a parent's recent completion of substance abuse treatment or other
8 compelling circumstances, then the permanency plan shall include a
9 period of protective supervision or trial home visit period of no less
10 than ninety (90) days prior to the court vacating the case. During the
11 protective supervision or trial home visit period, the department shall
12 make regular home visits. During the protective supervision or trial
13 home visit period, the court shall hold one (1) or more review hearings
14 for each permanency plan where a period of protective supervision or a
15 trial home visit has been imposed and may require participation in sup-
16 portive services, including community home visiting and peer-to-peer
17 mentoring. Families reunified following a period of protective super-
18 vision or a trial home visit should be encouraged by the department or
19 the court to continue to participate in supportive services when ben-
20 eficial and appropriate. If the permanency plan has a permanency goal
21 other than reunification, the plan shall include the information set
22 forth in section 16-1621(3)(d), Idaho Code, and if the permanency goal
23 is termination of parental rights and adoption, then in addition to the
24 information set forth in section 16-1620(3), Idaho Code, the permanency
25 plan shall also name the proposed adoptive parents when known. If the
26 adoptive parents are not known at the time the permanency plan is pre-
27 pared, then the department shall amend the plan to name the proposed
28 adoptive parents as soon as such person or persons become known. The
29 court may approve a permanency plan that includes a primary goal and a
30 concurrent goal. As used in this paragraph, "trial home visit" means
31 that a child is returned to the care of the parent or guardian from whom
32 the child was removed with the department continuing to have legal cus-
33 tody of the child.
34 (b) A permanency hearing shall be held no later than twelve (12) months
35 from the date the child is removed from the home or the date of the
36 court's order taking jurisdiction under this chapter, whichever occurs
37 first, and at least every twelve (12) months thereafter, as long as the
38 court has jurisdiction over the child. The court shall approve, reject
39 or modify the permanency plan of the department and review progress in
40 accomplishing the permanency goal. The permanency plan, as approved by
41 the court, shall be entered into the record as an order of the court. A
42 permanency hearing may be held at any time and may be combined with the
43 review hearing required under subsection (1) of this section.
44 (c) The court shall make written, case-specific findings whether the
45 department made reasonable efforts to finalize the primary permanency
46 goal in effect for the child. Lack of reasonable efforts to reunify may
47 be a basis for an order approving a permanency plan with a permanency
48 goal of reunification.
49 (d) Where the permanency goal is not reunification, the hearing shall
50 include a review of the department's consideration of options for

5
1 in-state and out-of-state placement of the child. In the case of a
2 child in an out-of-state placement, the court shall determine whether
3 the out-of-state placement continues to be appropriate and in the best
4 interest of the child.
5 (e) The court shall ask each youth age twelve (12) years and older about
6 his desired permanency outcome and discuss with the youth his current
7 permanency plan. In the case of a child who has attained the age of four-
8 teen (14) years and older, the hearing shall include a determination of
9 the services needed to assist the youth to make the transition from fos-
10 ter care to successful adulthood.
11 (f) The court may approve a primary permanency goal of another planned
12 permanent living arrangement only for youth age sixteen (16) years or
13 older and only upon written, case-specific findings that, as of the date
14 of the hearing:
15 (i) Another planned permanent living arrangement is the best per-
16 manency goal for the youth; and
17 (ii) There are compelling reasons why it is not in the best inter-
18 est of the youth to be placed permanently with a parent, in an adop-
19 tive placement, in a guardianship, or in the legal custody of the
20 department in a placement with a fit and willing relative, includ-
21 ing an adult sibling.
22 (g) If the child has been in the temporary or legal custody of the de-
23 partment for fifteen (15) of the most recent twenty-two (22) months, the
24 department shall file, prior to the last day of the fifteenth month, a
25 petition to terminate parental rights, unless the court finds that:
26 (i) The child is placed permanently with a relative;
27 (ii) There are compelling reasons why termination of parental
28 rights is not in the best interests of the child; or
29 (iii) The department has failed to provide reasonable efforts to
30 reunify the child with his family.
31 (h) The department shall document and the court shall inquire:
32 (i) As to the efforts made to ensure educational stability for the
33 child, including the efforts made to keep the child in the school
34 in which the child is enrolled at the time of placement or that re-
35 maining in the school is not in the child's best interests; and
36 (ii) That siblings were placed together, or, if siblings were not
37 placed together, the efforts made to place siblings together, the
38 reasons why siblings were not placed together or why a joint place-
39 ment would be contrary to the safety or well-being of one (1) or
40 more of the siblings, and a plan for ensuring frequent visitation
41 or ongoing interaction among siblings, unless visitation or ongo-
42 ing interaction would be contrary to the safety or well-being of

45 there has not been a final determination regarding the child's status as

19 hearing at which the court shall:
20 (a) Discuss with the youth his or her transition plan; and
21 (b) Review the transition plan with the youth for purposes of ensur-
22 ing that the plan provides the services necessary to allow the youth to
23 transition to a successful adulthood.

27 section and at each permanency hearing pursuant to subsection (2)(b) of this
28 section the department shall document:
29 (a) That ongoing assessment of the strengths and needs of the child con-
30 tinues to support the determination that the needs of the child cannot
31 be met through placement in a foster family home, that the placement in
32 a qualified residential treatment program provides the most effective
33 and appropriate level of care for the child that is in the least restric-
34 tive environment, and that the placement is consistent with the short-
35 term and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency
36 plan for the child;
37 (b) The specific treatment or service needs that will be met for the
38 child in the placement and the length of time the child is expected to
39 need the treatment or services; and
40 (c) The efforts made by the department to prepare the child to return
41 home or to be placed with a fit and willing relative, a legal guardian,
42 or an adoptive parent or in a foster family home.
43 (5) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the court may
44 order extended foster care for a person between the ages of eighteen (18) and
45 twenty-one (21) twenty-three (23) years to help such person achieve a suc-
46 cessful transition to adulthood, provided such person must have been in the
47 custody of the department until his eighteenth birthday and must meet the
48 criteria set forth in 42 U.S.C. 675(8)(B)(iv). The extension shall be for
49 a fixed period of time and shall not extend past the person's twenty-first
50 twenty-third birthday.
