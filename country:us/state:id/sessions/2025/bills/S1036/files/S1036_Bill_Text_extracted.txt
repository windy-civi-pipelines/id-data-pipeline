4 SECTION 39-4810, IDAHO CODE, TO PROVIDE A SHORT TITLE, TO ESTABLISH A

7 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
8 SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the Legislature to
9 protect Idaho adults and children from the adverse effects of experimental
10 gene therapy and biologic products utilized as immunizations. By enact-
11 ing this section, named in honor of Doug Cameron, the Legislature seeks to
12 establish a moratorium on gene therapy immunizations to ensure the safety
13 and well-being of all Idahoans. Doug Cameron, an Idaho rancher in excellent
14 health, was severely injured immediately after receiving a genetic immu-
15 nization encouraged by his employer. The injury left him disabled from the
16 waist down, unable to walk, and confined to a wheelchair. His experience
17 highlights the urgent need for caution, transparency, and rigorous over-
18 sight in the deployment of these treatments.

24 (2) The legislature finds that, in order to protect the health and
25 safety of Idaho citizens, a moratorium on the administration of human gene
26 therapy products in certain cases is necessary. No person in Idaho shall
27 administer, by any route or modality, any human gene therapy product for any
28 infectious disease indication, regardless of whether such administration is
29 termed an immunization, vaccine, or any other term.
30 (3) For the purpose of this section, "human gene therapy product" means
31 all products that mediate their effects by transcription or translation of
32 transferred genetic material or by specifically altering human genetic se-
33 quences. Human gene therapy products include but are not limited to:
34 (a) Nucleic acids, such as plasmids and in vitro transcribed ribonu-
35 cleic acid (RNA);
36 (b) Genetically modified microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria,
37 and fungi;
38 (c) Engineered site-specific nucleases used for human genome editing;
39 and
40 (d) Ex vivo genetically modified human cells.

1 (4) The provisions of this section shall not apply to human gene therapy
2 products utilized for treatment or therapy of cancer or genetic disorders.
3 (5) The moratorium described in this section shall remain in effect un-
4 til July 1, 2035, subject to legislative review of available safety data.
