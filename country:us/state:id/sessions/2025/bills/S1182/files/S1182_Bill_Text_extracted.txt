4 risdiction and venue, notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection.

14 guardianship.
15 (b) In any action occurring pursuant to the provisions of this subsec-
16 tion, the department of health and welfare shall have the right to ap-
17 pear and be heard at any hearing and shall have the right to intervene at
18 any stage of the action.
19 (c) A guardian appointed in an action occurring pursuant to this sub-
20 section may not consent to the adoption of the minor without providing
21 prior notice of the action of adoption to the department of health and

40 over issues related to administration of the guardianship or conserva-
41 torship.
42 (4) A court that appoints a guardian or conservator or authorizes a pro-
43 tective arrangement under this chapter has exclusive and continuing juris-
44 diction over the proceeding until the court terminates the proceeding or the
45 appointment or protective arrangement expires by its terms.

47 do not apply to a guardianship or conservatorship for an adult that is sub-
48 ject to the transfer provisions of part 3, chapter 13, title 15, Idaho Code,
49 the uniform adult guardianship and protective proceedings jurisdiction act.
6
1 (2) After appointment of a guardian or conservator, the court that made
2 the appointment may transfer the proceeding to a court in another county in
3 this state or another state if transfer is in the best interest of the indi-
4 vidual subject to the guardianship or conservatorship.
5 (3) If a proceeding for a guardianship or conservatorship is pending in
6 another state or a foreign country and a petition for guardianship or conser-
7 vatorship for the same individual is filed in a court in this state, the court

9 sultation with that court, assume or decline jurisdiction, whichever is in
10 the best interest of the respondent.

46 promptly shall disclose that knowledge to the court.
47 (4) If a conservator engages or anticipates engaging an agent to manage
48 finances of the individual subject to conservatorship and knows the agent is

15 sonable attorney's fees and costs from the property of the individual sub-
16 ject to guardianship or conservatorship.

35 court approval, a guardian is entitled to reasonable compensation for ser-
36 vices as guardian and to reimbursement for room, board, clothing, and other
37 appropriate expenses advanced for the benefit of the individual subject
38 to guardianship. If a conservator, other than the guardian or a person

46 tor, the court, or a conservator in determining reasonable compensation for
47 a guardian as provided in subsection (1) of this section, shall consider:
11
1 (a) The necessity and quality of the services provided;
2 (b) The experience, training, professional standing, and skills of the
3 guardian or conservator;
4 (c) The difficulty of the services performed, including the degree of
5 skill and care required;
6 (d) The conditions and circumstances under which a service was per-
7 formed, including whether the service was provided outside regular
8 business hours or under dangerous or extraordinary conditions;
9 (e) The effect of the services on the individual subject to guardian-
10 ship or conservatorship;
11 (f) The extent to which the services provided were or were not consis-
12 tent with the guardian's plan under section 15-5-316, Idaho Code, or
13 conservator's plan under section 15-5-419, Idaho Code; and
14 (g) The fees customarily paid to a person that performs a like service
15 in the community.

17 penses of the individual subject to guardianship or conservatorship.

20 guardian or conservator, the court may order compensation to the guardian or

22 only to the extent the court determines the opposition was reasonably nec-
23 essary to protect the interest of the individual subject to guardianship or
24 conservatorship.
25 (6) If the estate is inadequate to bear any of the reasonable compensa-
26 tion, fees, or costs referenced in this section, the court may apportion the
27 reasonable compensation, fees, or costs to any party, or among the parties,

33 guardianship or conservatorship.
34 15-5-122. PETITION AFTER APPOINTMENT FOR INSTRUCTION OR RATIFICA-
35 TION. (1) A guardian or conservator may petition the court for instruction
36 concerning fiduciary responsibility or ratification of a particular act
37 related to the guardianship or conservatorship.

40 der.
41 15-5-123. THIRD-PARTY ACCEPTANCE OF AUTHORITY OF GUARDIAN OR CONSER-
42 VATOR. (1) A person shall not recognize the authority of a guardian or con-
43 servator to act on behalf of an individual subject to guardianship or conser-
44 vatorship if:
45 (a) The person has actual knowledge or a reasonable belief that the let-
46 ters of office of the guardian or conservator are invalid or the con-
12
1 servator or guardian is exceeding or improperly exercising authority
2 granted by the court; or
3 (b) The person has actual knowledge that the individual subject to
4 guardianship or conservatorship is subject to physical or financial
5 abuse, neglect, exploitation, or abandonment by the guardian or conser-
6 vator or a person acting for or with the guardian or conservator.
7 (2) A person may refuse to recognize the authority of a guardian or con-
8 servator to act on behalf of an individual subject to guardianship or conser-
9 vatorship if:
10 (a) The guardian's or conservator's proposed action would be inconsis-
11 tent with the provisions of this chapter; or

16 financial abuse, neglect, exploitation, or abandonment by the guardian
17 or conservator or a person acting for or with the guardian or conserva-
18 tor.
19 (3) A person that refuses to accept the authority of a guardian or con-
20 servator in accordance with subsection (2) of this section may report the
21 refusal and the reason for refusal to the court. The court upon receiving
22 the report shall consider whether removal of the guardian or conservator or
23 other action is appropriate.
24 (4) A guardian or conservator may petition the court to require a third
25 party to accept a decision made by the guardian or conservator on behalf of
26 the individual subject to guardianship or conservatorship.
27 15-5-124. USE OF AGENT BY GUARDIAN OR CONSERVATOR. (1) Except as oth-
28 erwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, a guardian or conserva-
29 tor may delegate a power to an agent that a prudent guardian or conservator
30 of comparable skills could delegate prudently under the circumstances if the
31 delegation is consistent with the guardian's or conservator's fiduciary du-
32 ties and the guardian's plan under section 15-5-316, Idaho Code, or conser-
33 vator's plan under section 15-5-419, Idaho Code.
34 (2) In delegating a power under subsection (1) of this section, the
35 guardian or conservator shall exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution
36 in:
37 (a) Selecting the agent;
38 (b) Establishing the scope and terms of the agent's work in accordance
39 with the guardian's plan under section 15-5-316, Idaho Code, or conser-
40 vator's plan under section 15-5-419, Idaho Code;
41 (c) Monitoring the agent's performance and compliance with the delega-
42 tion; and
43 (d) Redressing an act or omission of the agent that would constitute a
44 breach of the guardian's or conservator's duties if done by the guardian
45 or conservator.
46 (3) A guardian or conservator may not delegate all powers to an agent.
47 (4) In performing a power delegated under this section, an agent shall:
48 (a) Exercise reasonable care to comply with the terms of the delegation
49 and use reasonable care in the performance of the power; and
13
1 (b) If the guardian or conservator has delegated to the agent the power
2 to make a decision on behalf of the individual subject to guardianship
3 or conservatorship, use the same decision-making standard the guardian
4 or conservator would be required to use.
5 (5) By accepting a delegation of a power under subsection (1) of this
6 section from a guardian or conservator, an agent submits to the personal ju-
7 risdiction of the courts of this state in an action involving the agent's
8 performance as agent.
9 (6) A guardian or conservator that delegates and monitors a power in
10 compliance with this section is not liable for the decision, act, or omission
11 of the agent.

15 (a) A proceeding to remove a guardian for the individual subject to
16 guardianship is pending; or
17 (b) The court finds a guardian is not effectively performing the
18 guardian's duties and the welfare of the individual subject to
19 guardianship requires immediate action.
20 (2) The court may appoint a temporary substitute conservator for an
21 individual subject to conservatorship for a period not exceeding six (6)
22 months if:
23 (a) A proceeding to remove a conservator for the individual subject to

25 (b) The court finds that a conservator for the individual subject to

27 and the welfare of the individual subject to conservatorship or the con-
28 servatorship estate requires immediate action.
29 (3) Except as otherwise ordered by the court, a temporary substitute
30 guardian or temporary substitute conservator appointed under this section
31 has the powers stated in the order of appointment of the guardian or conser-
32 vator. The authority of the existing guardian or conservator is suspended
33 for as long as the temporary substitute guardian or conservator has author-
34 ity.
35 (4) The court shall give notice of appointment of a temporary substi-
36 tute guardian or temporary substitute conservator, not later than seven (7)
37 days after the appointment, to:
38 (a) The individual subject to guardianship or conservatorship;
39 (b) The affected guardian or conservator; and
40 (c) In the case of a minor, each parent of the minor and any person cur-
41 rently having care or custody of the minor.
42 (5) The court may remove a temporary substitute guardian or temporary
43 substitute conservator at any time. The temporary substitute guardian or
44 temporary substitute conservator shall make any report the court requires.
45 15-5-126. REGISTRATION OF ORDER -- EFFECT. (1) If a guardian has been
46 appointed in another state for an individual, and a petition for guardian-
47 ship for the individual is not pending in this state, the guardian appointed
48 in the other state, after giving notice to the appointing court, may regis-
14
1 ter the guardianship order in this state by filing as a foreign judgment, in
2 a court of an appropriate county of this state, certified copies of the order
3 and letters of guardianship.
4 (2) If a conservator has been appointed in another state for an individ-
5 ual, and a petition for conservatorship for the individual is not pending in
6 this state, the conservator appointed for the individual in the other state,
7 after giving notice to the appointing court, may register the conservator-
8 ship in this state by filing as a foreign judgment, in a court of a county in
9 which property belonging to the individual subject to conservatorship is lo-

11 vatorship, and any bond or other asset-protection arrangement required by
12 the court.
13 (3) Upon registration under this section of a guardianship or conserva-
14 torship order from another state, the guardian or conservator may exercise
15 in this state all powers authorized in the order except as prohibited by this
16 chapter and law of this state other than this chapter. If the guardian or
17 conservator is not a resident of this state, the guardian or conservator may
18 maintain an action or proceeding in this state subject to any condition im-
19 posed by this state on an action or proceeding by a nonresident party.
20 (4) The court may grant any relief available under this chapter and law
21 of this state other than this chapter to enforce an order registered under
22 this section.
23 15-5-127. GRIEVANCE AGAINST GUARDIAN OR CONSERVATOR. (1) An individ-
24 ual who is subject to guardianship or conservatorship, or a person inter-
25 ested in the welfare of an individual subject to guardianship or conserva-
26 torship, that reasonably believes the guardian or conservator is breaching
27 the guardian's or conservator's fiduciary duty or otherwise acting in a man-
28 ner inconsistent with this chapter may file a grievance in a record with the
29 court.
30 (2) Subject to subsection (3) of this section, after receiving a
31 grievance under subsection (1) of this section, the court:
32 (a) Shall review the grievance and, if necessary to determine the ap-
33 propriate response, court records related to the guardianship or con-
34 servatorship;
35 (b) Shall schedule a hearing if the individual subject to guardianship
36 or conservatorship is an adult and the grievance supports a reasonable
37 belief that:
38 (i) Removal of the guardian and appointment of a successor may be
39 appropriate under section 15-5-318, Idaho Code;
40 (ii) Termination or modification of the guardianship may be ap-
41 propriate under section 15-5-319, Idaho Code;

3 guardianship or conservatorship; or
4 (iv) Holding a hearing.
5 (3) The court may decline to act under subsection (2) of this section if

7 of the current grievance and the court followed the procedures of subsection
8 (2) in considering the earlier grievance.
9 15-5-128. DELEGATION OF POWERS BY PARENT. A parent of a minor or in-
10 capacitated person, by a properly executed power of attorney, may delegate
11 to another person, for a period not exceeding six (6) months, or in the case
12 of military personnel serving beyond the territorial limits of the United
13 States for a period not exceeding twelve (12) months, any of the parent's
14 powers regarding care, custody, or property of the minor, including but not
15 limited to powers for medical care and educational care of the minor, except
16 the parent's power to consent to marriage or adoption of a minor. The delega-
17 tion for a minor to a grandparent of the minor, or to a sibling of the minor,
18 or to a sibling of either parent of the minor, shall continue in effect un-
19 til the time period, date, or condition set forth in the power of attorney for
20 automatic expiration of the power of attorney occurs. If the power of attor-
21 ney does not provide a time period, date, or condition for automatic expira-
22 tion of the power, the power of attorney shall continue in effect for a period
23 of three (3) years. The power may be revoked prior to the expiration of the
24 three (3) year period, or prior to the time period, date, or condition for au-
25 tomatic expiration, in a writing delivered to the grandparent or sibling by
26 the delegating parent. The power of attorney does not need to be notarized or
27 recorded to be valid. However, if the power is recorded, any revocation of
28 the power by a writing shall also be recorded before the revocation is effec-
29 tive.
30 15-5-129. EVIDENCE IN PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING VETERANS BENEFITS. If
31 benefits derived from the United States through the veterans administration
32 are involved in any proceeding under this chapter, a certificate of the ad-
33 ministrator or his authorized representative shall be prima facie evidence
34 of the necessity of appointment of a guardian or conservator or both if:
35 (1) It sets forth the age of the minor involved in the proceeding as
36 shown by the records of the veterans administration and the fact that ap-
37 pointment is a condition precedent to payment of any moneys; or
38 (2) It sets forth the fact that a purportedly incapacitated person in-
39 volved in the proceeding has been rated incompetent by the veterans adminis-
40 tration upon examination pursuant to the laws governing such administration
41 and that appointment of a guardian is a condition precedent to payment of any
42 moneys due such incapacitated person.
43 15-5-130. COPIES OF PUBLIC RECORDS TO BE FURNISHED. When a copy of any
44 public record is required by the veterans administration to be used in deter-
45 mining the eligibility of any persons to participate in benefits made avail-
46 able by the veterans administration, the official custodian of such public
47 records shall without charge provide the applicant for such benefits or any
16
1 person acting on his behalf or the authorized representative of the veterans
2 administration with a certified copy of such record.
3 SECTION 4. That Chapter 5, Title 15, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
4 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW PART, to be known and desig-
5 nated as Part 2, Chapter 5, Title 15, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
6 PART 2
7 GUARDIANSHIP OF MINOR
8 15-5-201. BASIS FOR APPOINTMENT OF GUARDIAN FOR MINOR. (1) Testamen-
9 tary appointment of guardian of minor. A parent of a minor may appoint a
10 guardian of an unmarried minor by will, subject to the right of the minor to
11 object to the appointment. The termination of parental rights of a parent
12 as to the minor shall also terminate the right of that parent to appoint a
13 guardian for the minor. A testamentary appointment becomes effective upon
14 the filing of the guardian's acceptance in the court in which the will is
15 probated, if, at the decedent's death, no parent of the minor was alive who
16 had a right to appoint a guardian for the minor. This state recognizes a
17 testamentary appointment effected by the guardian's acceptance under a will
18 probated in another state that is the testator's domicile. Written notice
19 of acceptance of the appointment shall be given by the guardian to the mi-
20 nor and to the person having his custody, or if none, to the person having
21 his care, or if none, to his nearest adult relation immediately upon accep-
22 tance of appointment. The parent may appoint by will one (1) or more alter-
23 nate guardians, in order of priority. If a guardian appointed by will fails
24 to accept guardianship within thirty (30) days after the will is probated,
25 or files a notice of declination to accept appointment prior to the running
26 of the thirty (30) day period, or is deceased, or ceases to act after accep-
27 tance, then the alternate guardian next in priority becomes the appointed
28 guardian and may file a written notice of acceptance in the court in which the
29 will is probated.
30 (2) Objection by minor twelve (12) years of age or older. A minor
31 twelve (12) years of age or older may prevent an appointment of his testamen-
32 tary guardian from becoming effective, or may cause a previously accepted
33 appointment to terminate, by filing with the court in which the will is
34 probated a written objection to the appointment before it is accepted or
35 within thirty (30) days after notice of its acceptance. An objection may be
36 withdrawn. In the event of such objection, the alternate guardian next in
37 priority named in the will may accept appointment, and the minor shall have
38 the same right of objection. An objection does not preclude appointment by
39 the court in a proper proceeding by the testamentary nominee or any other
40 suitable person.
41 (3) Testamentary appointment of guardian for incapacitated person or
42 developmentally disabled person.
43 (a) The parent of an incapacitated person or developmentally disabled
44 person may by will appoint a guardian of the incapacitated person or de-
45 velopmentally disabled person. A testamentary appointment by a parent
46 becomes effective when, after having given seven (7) days' prior writ-
47 ten notice of his intention to do so to the incapacitated person or de-
48 velopmentally disabled person and to the person having his care or to
17
1 his nearest adult relative, the guardian files acceptance of appoint-
2 ment in the court in which the will is informally or formally probated,
3 if prior thereto both parents are dead or the surviving parent is ad-
4 judged incapacitated. If both parents are dead, an effective appoint-
5 ment by the parent who died later has priority unless it is terminated by
6 the denial of probate in formal proceedings.
7 (b) The spouse of a married incapacitated person or developmentally
8 disabled person may by will appoint a guardian of the incapacitated
9 person or developmentally disabled person. The appointment becomes
10 effective when, after having given seven (7) days' prior written notice
11 of his intention to do so to the incapacitated person or developmentally
12 disabled person and to the person having his care or to his nearest adult
13 relative, the guardian files acceptance of appointment in the court
14 in which the will is informally or formally probated. An effective
15 appointment by a spouse has priority over an appointment by a parent
16 unless it is terminated by the denial of probate in formal proceedings.
17 (c) This state shall recognize a testamentary appointment effected by
18 filing acceptance under a will probated at the testator's domicile in
19 another state.
20 (d) Upon the filing with the court in which the will was probated of
21 written objection to the appointment by the person for whom a tes-
22 tamentary appointment of guardian has been made, the appointment is
23 terminated. An objection does not prevent appointment by the court in
24 a proper proceeding of the testamentary nominee or any other suitable
25 person upon an adjudication of incapacity in proceedings under the suc-
26 ceeding sections of this part.
27 (e) If the appointment by will is for a developmentally disabled person
28 and there is an existing guardianship proceeding under chapter 4, ti-
29 tle 66, Idaho Code, or under this chapter, in which the decedent was the
30 sole guardian, the guardian appointed by will shall also give seven (7)
31 days' written notice of his intention to file an acceptance of appoint-
32 ment to any then-serving guardian ad litem for the developmentally dis-
33 abled person in such proceeding and to the department of health and wel-
34 fare for the region in which the proceeding was brought.
35 (4) Court appointment of guardian of minor and conditions for appoint-
36 ment.
37 (a) The court may appoint a guardian for an unmarried minor if all
38 parental rights of custody have been terminated by prior court order
39 or upon a finding that the child has been neglected, abused, or aban-
40 doned or that the child's parents are unable to provide a stable home
41 environment. As used in this subsection, "abandoned," "abused," and
42 "neglected" shall have the same meaning as provided in section 16-1602,
43 Idaho Code. Failure to maintain a normal parental relationship with the
44 child without just cause for a period of six (6) months shall constitute
45 prima facie evidence of abandonment. Except in those circumstances de-
46 scribed in subsections (2) and (3) of this section and where a temporary
47 guardianship has been created at the request of a parent on active duty
48 in or deployment with the United States armed forces, the court shall
49 consider the best interest of the child as the primary factor in the de-
50 termination whether to appoint, and whom to appoint as, a guardian for
18
1 such child. In determining the choice of a guardian for an unmarried
2 minor, the advanced age or disability of a potential guardian shall not,
3 in and of itself, be used as a criterion of the suitability of the poten-
4 tial guardian as long as the potential guardian is otherwise suitable.
5 A guardian appointed by will, as provided in subsection (1) of this
6 section, whose appointment has not been prevented or nullified, as pro-
7 vided in subsection (2) of this section, has priority over any guardian
8 who may be appointed by the court, but the court may proceed with an ap-
9 pointment nonetheless upon a finding that the testamentary guardian has
10 failed to accept the testamentary appointment within thirty (30) days
11 after notice of the guardianship proceeding.
12 (b) The extended absence of a parent due to active duty in or deployment
13 with the United States armed forces shall not by itself constitute ne-
14 glect, abuse, abandonment, or failure to provide a stable home environ-
15 ment.
16 (c) Any guardianship granted at the request of or required by the United
17 States armed forces or at the request of a parent while on active duty
18 in or deployment with the United States armed forces, which duty or de-
19 ployment does not constitute neglect, abuse, abandonment, or failure
20 to provide a stable home environment, shall be terminated immediately
21 upon the conclusion of the original circumstances necessitating the
22 creation of the temporary guardianship or the filing of a termination
23 report by the parent indicating the parent's intent to resume all care,
24 custody, and control of the minor.
25 15-5-202. PETITION FOR APPOINTMENT OF GUARDIAN FOR MINOR. (1) A person
26 interested in the welfare of a minor, including the minor, may petition for
27 appointment of a guardian for the minor.
28 (2) A petition under subsection (1) of this section shall state the
29 petitioner's name, principal residence, current street address, email ad-
30 dress, phone number, relationship to the minor, interest in the appointment,
31 and, if known, the name, address, email address, and phone number of any at-
32 torney representing the petitioner, and, to the extent known, the following:
33 (a) The minor's name, age, principal residence, current street ad-
34 dress, if different, and, if different, address of the dwelling in which
35 it is proposed the minor will reside if the appointment is made;
36 (b) The name, current street address, email address, and phone number,
37 if known, of the minor's parents;
38 (c) The name, address, email address, and phone number, if known, of
39 each person that had primary care or custody of the minor for at least
40 sixty (60) days during the two (2) years immediately before the filing
41 of the petition or for at least seven hundred thirty (730) days during
42 the five (5) years immediately before the filing of the petition;
43 (d) The name, address, email address, and phone number of any attorney
44 for the minor and any attorney for each parent of the minor;
45 (e) The reason guardianship is sought and would be in the best interest
46 of the minor;
47 (f) The name, address, email address, and phone number, if known, of
48 any proposed guardian and the reason the proposed guardian should be se-
49 lected;
19

15 appropriate action consistent with this chapter or law of this state other
16 than this chapter.
17 (2) In appointing a guardian under subsection (1) of this section, the
18 following rules apply:
19 (a) The court shall appoint a person nominated as guardian by a par-
20 ent of the minor in a will or other record as provided in section 15-5-
21 201(1), Idaho Code, unless the court finds the appointment is contrary
22 to the best interest of the minor.
23 (b) If multiple parents have nominated different persons to serve as
24 guardian, the court shall appoint the nominee whose appointment is in
25 the best interest of the minor, unless the court finds that appointment
26 of none of the nominees is in the best interest of the minor.
27 (c) If a guardian is not appointed under paragraph (a) or (b) of this
28 subsection, the court shall appoint the person nominated by the minor
29 if the minor is twelve (12) years of age or older unless the court finds
30 that appointment is contrary to the best interest of the minor. In that
31 case, the court shall appoint as guardian a person whose appointment is
32 in the best interest of the minor.
33 (3) In the interest of maintaining or encouraging involvement by a mi-
34 nor's parent in the minor's life, developing self-reliance of the minor, or
35 for other good cause, the court, at the time of appointment of a guardian
36 for the minor or later, on its own or on motion of the minor or other inter-
37 ested person, may create a limited guardianship by limiting the powers oth-
38 erwise granted by this part to the guardian. Following the same procedure,
39 the court may grant additional powers or withdraw powers previously granted.
40 (4) The court, as part of an order appointing a guardian for a minor,
41 shall state rights retained by any parent of the minor that may include con-
42 tact or visitation with the minor, decision-making regarding the minor's
43 health care, education, or other matter, or access to a record regarding the
44 minor.
45 (5) An order granting a guardianship for a minor shall state that each
46 parent of the minor is entitled to notice that:
47 (a) The guardian has delegated custody of the minor subject to
48 guardianship;
49 (b) The court has modified or limited the powers of the guardian; or
22
1 (c) The court has removed the guardian.
2 (6) An order granting a guardianship for a minor shall identify any
3 person in addition to a parent of the minor who is entitled to notice of the
4 events listed in subsection (5) of this section.
5 15-5-207. DE FACTO CUSTODIAN. If a court determines by clear and con-
6 vincing evidence that a person meets the definition of a de facto custodian
7 and that recognition of the de facto custodian is in the best interest of the
8 child, the court shall give the person the same standing that is given to each
9 parent in proceedings for appointment of a guardian of a minor. In determin-
10 ing whether recognition of a de facto custodian is in the child's best inter-
11 est, the court shall consider:
12 (1) Whether the child is currently residing with the person seeking
13 such standing; and
14 (2) If the child is not currently residing with the person seeking such
15 standing, the length of time since the person served as the child's primary
16 caregiver and primary financial supporter.
17 15-5-208. EMERGENCY GUARDIAN FOR MINOR. (1) On its own, or on petition
18 by a person interested in a minor's welfare, the court may appoint an emer-
19 gency guardian for the minor if the court finds:
20 (a) Appointment of an emergency guardian is likely to prevent substan-
21 tial harm to the minor's health, safety, or welfare; and
22 (b) No other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in
23 the circumstances.

25 not exceed ninety (90) days, and the emergency guardian may exercise only the

27 thority may be extended once for not more than ninety (90) days if the court
28 finds that the conditions for appointment of an emergency guardian in sub-
29 section (1) of this section continue.
30 (3) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section,
31 reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of a hearing on a petition for
32 appointment of an emergency guardian for a minor shall be given to:
33 (a) The minor, if the minor is twelve (12) years of age or older;
34 (b) Any attorney appointed under section 15-5-204, Idaho Code;
35 (c) Each parent of the minor;
36 (d) Any person, other than a parent, having care or custody of the mi-
37 nor; and
38 (e) Any other person as the court determines.
39 (4) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for a minor without no-
40 tice under subsection (3) of this section and without a hearing only if the
41 court finds from an affidavit or testimony that the minor's health, safety,
42 or welfare will be substantially harmed before a hearing with notice on the
43 appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emergency guardian with-
44 out notice to an unrepresented minor or the attorney for a represented mi-
45 nor, notice of the appointment shall be given not later than forty-eight (48)
46 hours after the appointment to the individuals listed in subsection (3) of
47 this section. Not later than seven (7) days after the appointment, the court
48 shall hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment.
23
1 (5) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section, with or
2 without notice, is not a determination that a basis exists for appointment of
3 a guardian under section 15-5-201, Idaho Code.
4 (6) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under this
5 section at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report the court
6 requires.

25 (i) Termination of the guardianship would be harmful to the mi-
26 nor; and

31 fare of the minor may petition the court to terminate the guardianship, mod-

9 vincing evidence that:

12 respondent is unable to receive and evaluate information or make
13 or communicate decisions, even with appropriate supportive ser-
14 vices, technological assistance, or supported decision-making;

23 (2) The court shall grant a guardian appointed under subsection (1) of
24 this section only those powers necessitated by the demonstrated needs and
25 limitations of the respondent and issue orders that will encourage develop-
26 ment of the respondent's maximum self-determination and independence. The
27 court may not establish a full guardianship if a limited guardianship, pro-
28 tective arrangement instead of guardianship, or other less restrictive al-
29 ternatives would meet the needs of the respondent.

42 dio-visual technology.

47 the hearing after having been fully informed of the right to attend and
48 the potential consequences of failing to attend; or

2 ticipate in the hearing even with appropriate supportive services and
3 technological assistance.

5 Idaho Code, by a person or persons of the respondent's choosing, assistive
6 technology, or an interpreter or translator, or a combination of these sup-

11 respondent at a hearing under section 15-5-303, Idaho Code.

26 ipation.
27 15-5-308. CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS. The confidentiality of records
28 in a proceeding for guardianship for an adult shall be maintained in accor-

44 of this section, the court shall select as guardian the person the court con-
45 siders best qualified. In determining the best qualified person, the court
46 shall consider the person's relationship with the respondent, the person's
47 skills, the expressed wishes of the respondent, the extent to which the per-
48 son and the respondent have similar values and preferences, and the like-
30
1 lihood the person will be able to perform the duties of a guardian success-
2 fully.
3 (3) The court, acting in the best interest of the respondent, may de-
4 cline to appoint as guardian a person having priority under subsection (1) of
5 this section and appoint a person having a lower priority or no priority.
6 (4) A person that provides paid services to the respondent, or an indi-
7 vidual who is employed by a person that provides paid services to the respon-

17 which the respondent is receiving care may not be appointed as guardian un-
18 less the owner, operator, or employee is related to the respondent by blood,
19 marriage, or adoption.
20 (6) Unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that such

22 pointed as a guardian of a respondent if the person is:
23 (a) A convicted felon; or
24 (b) A person whose residence is the respondent's proposed residence or
25 will be frequented by the respondent and is frequented by a convicted
26 felon.
27 15-5-310. ORDER OF APPOINTMENT FOR GUARDIAN. (1) A court order ap-
28 pointing a guardian for an adult shall:
29 (a) Include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence es-
30 tablished that the identified needs of the respondent cannot be met by a
31 protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restric-
32 tive alternative, including use of appropriate supportive services,
33 technological assistance, or supported decision-making;
34 (b) Include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence es-
35 tablished the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on the

39 findings, established by clear and convincing evidence, that support
40 removing that right.

42 the order includes findings that support removing that right by clear and
43 convincing evidence required by subsection (1)(c) of this section.
44 (3) A court order establishing a full guardianship for an adult subject
45 to guardianship shall state the basis for granting a full guardianship and
46 include specific findings by clear and convincing evidence that support the
47 conclusion that a limited guardianship would not meet the functional needs
48 of the adult subject to guardianship.
31
1 (4) A court order establishing a limited guardianship for an adult
2 subject to guardianship shall state the specific powers granted to the
3 guardian.
4 (5) The court, as part of an order establishing a guardianship for an

34 right to request termination or modification. The order and notice shall be
35 given not later than fourteen (14) days after the appointment.
36 (2) Not later than thirty (30) days after appointment of a guardian un-
37 der section 15-5-309, Idaho Code, the court shall give to the adult subject
38 to guardianship, to the guardian, and to any other person entitled to notice
39 under section 15-5-310(5), Idaho Code, or under a subsequent order, a state-
40 ment of the rights of the adult subject to guardianship and the procedures to
41 seek relief if the adult is denied those rights. The statement shall be com-
42 municated in the manner set forth in section 15-5-113(3), Idaho Code. The
43 statement shall notify the adult subject to guardianship of the right to:
44 (a) Seek termination or modification of the guardianship or removal of
45 the guardian and choose an attorney to represent the adult subject to
46 guardianship in these matters;

6 (d) Be notified at least fourteen (14) days before a change in the
7 adult subject to guardianship's primary dwelling or permanent move to
8 a nursing home, mental health facility, or other facility that places
9 restrictions on the adult subject to guardianship's ability to leave or
10 have visitors unless the change or move is proposed in the guardian's
11 plan under section 15-5-316, Idaho Code, or authorized by the court by
12 specific order;
13 (e) Object to a change or move described in paragraph (d) of this sub-
14 section and the process for objecting;
15 (f) Communicate, visit, or interact with others, including receiving

17 electronic communications, including through social media, unless:
18 (i) The guardian has been authorized by the court by specific or-
19 der to restrict communications, visits, or interactions;
20 (ii) A protective order or protective arrangement instead of
21 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult
22 subject to guardianship and a person; or
23 (iii) The guardian has good cause to believe restriction is nec-
24 essary because interaction with a specified person poses a risk
25 of significant physical, psychological, or financial harm to the
26 adult subject to guardianship, and the restriction is:
27 1. For a period of not more than seven (7) business days if
28 the person has a family or preexisting social relationship
29 with the adult subject to guardianship; or

32 ship with the adult subject to guardianship;

36 15-5-312. EMERGENCY GUARDIAN FOR ADULT. (1) On its own, after a peti-
37 tion has been filed under section 15-5-302, Idaho Code, or upon petition by a
38 person interested in an adult respondent's welfare, the court may appoint an
39 emergency guardian for the respondent if the court finds:
40 (a) Appointment of an emergency guardian is likely to prevent substan-
41 tial harm to the respondent's physical health, safety, or welfare;
42 (b) No other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in
43 the circumstances; and
44 (c) There is reason to believe that a basis for appointment of a
45 guardian under section 15-5-301, Idaho Code, exists.
46 (2) The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for an adult may
47 not exceed ninety (90) days, and the emergency guardian may exercise only the
48 powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency guardian's au-
49 thority may be extended once for not more than ninety (90) days if the court
33
1 finds that the conditions for appointment of an emergency guardian in sub-
2 section (1) of this section continue.
3 (3) Immediately upon filing of a petition for appointment of an emer-
4 gency guardian for an adult, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent
5 the respondent in the proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in subsec-
6 tion (4) of this section, reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of
7 a hearing on the petition shall be given to the respondent, the respondent's
8 attorney, and any other person as the court determines.
9 (4) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for an adult respondent
10 without notice to the respondent and any attorney for the respondent only if
11 the court finds from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's physi-
12 cal health, safety, or welfare will be substantially harmed before a hearing
13 with notice on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emer-
14 gency guardian without giving notice under subsection (3) of this section,
15 the court shall:
16 (a) Give notice of the appointment not later than forty-eight (48)
17 hours after the appointment to:
18 (i) The respondent;
19 (ii) The respondent's attorney; and
20 (iii) Any other person as the court determines; and
21 (b) Hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment not later
22 than seven (7) days after the appointment.
23 (5) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section is not a de-
24 termination that a basis exists for appointment of a guardian under section
25 15-5-301, Idaho Code.
26 (6) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under this
27 section at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report the court
28 requires.
29 15-5-313. DUTIES OF GUARDIAN FOR ADULT. (1) A guardian for an adult is
30 a fiduciary. Except as otherwise limited by the court, a guardian for an
31 adult shall make decisions regarding the support, care, education, health,
32 and welfare of the adult subject to guardianship to the extent necessitated
33 by the adult subject to guardianship's limitations.
34 (2) A guardian for an adult subject to guardianship shall promote the
35 self-determination of the adult subject to guardianship and, to the extent
36 reasonably feasible, encourage the adult subject to guardianship to partic-
37 ipate in decisions, act on the adult subject to guardianship's own behalf,
38 and develop or regain the capacity to manage the adult subject to guardian-
39 ship's personal affairs. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:
40 (a) Become or remain personally acquainted with the adult subject to
41 guardianship and maintain sufficient contact with the adult subject to
42 guardianship, including through regular visitation, to know the adult
43 subject to guardianship's abilities, limitations, needs, opportuni-
44 ties, and physical and mental health;
45 (b) To the extent reasonably feasible, identify the values and prefer-
46 ences of the adult subject to guardianship and involve the adult subject
47 to guardianship in decisions affecting the adult subject to guardian-
48 ship, including decisions about the adult subject to guardianship's
49 care, dwelling, activities, or social interactions; and
34
1 (c) Make reasonable efforts to identify and facilitate supportive re-
2 lationships and services for the adult subject to guardianship.
3 (3) A guardian for an adult subject to guardianship at all times shall
4 exercise reasonable care, diligence, and prudence when acting on behalf of
5 or making decisions for the adult subject to guardianship. In furtherance of
6 this duty, the guardian shall:
7 (a) Take reasonable care of the personal effects, pets, and service
8 or support animals of the adult subject to guardianship and bring a
9 proceeding for a conservatorship or protective arrangement instead of
10 conservatorship if necessary to protect the adult subject to guardian-
11 ship's property;
12 (b) Expend funds and other property of the adult subject to guardian-
13 ship received by the guardian for the adult subject to guardianship's
14 current needs for support, care, education, health, and welfare;
15 (c) Conserve any funds and other property of the adult subject to
16 guardianship not expended under paragraph (b) of this subsection for
17 the adult subject to guardianship's future needs, but if a conservator
18 has been appointed for the adult subject to guardianship, pay the funds
19 and other property at least quarterly to the conservator to be conserved
20 for the adult subject to guardianship's future needs; and
21 (d) Monitor the quality of services, including long-term care ser-
22 vices, provided to the adult subject to guardianship.
23 (4) In making a decision for an adult subject to guardianship, the
24 guardian shall make the decision the guardian reasonably believes the adult
25 subject to guardianship would make if the adult subject to guardianship
26 were able unless doing so would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or
27 personal or financial interests of the adult subject to guardianship. To
28 determine the decision the adult subject to guardianship would make if able,
29 the guardian shall consider the adult subject to guardianship's previous
30 or current directions, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to the
31 extent actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.
32 (5) If a guardian for an adult subject to guardianship cannot make a
33 decision under subsection (4) of this section because the guardian does
34 not know and cannot reasonably determine the decision the adult subject
35 to guardianship probably would make if able, or the guardian reasonably
36 believes the decision the adult subject to guardianship would make would
37 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests
38 of the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian shall act in accordance
39 with the best interest of the adult subject to guardianship. In determining
40 the best interest of the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian shall
41 consider:
42 (a) Information received from professionals and persons that demon-
43 strate sufficient interest in the welfare of the adult subject to
44 guardianship;
45 (b) Other information the guardian believes the adult subject to
46 guardianship would have considered if the adult subject to guardianship
47 were able to act; and
48 (c) Other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the adult
49 subject to guardianship would consider, including consequences for
50 others.
35
1 (6) A guardian for an adult subject to guardianship shall immediately
2 notify the court if the condition of the adult subject to guardianship has
3 changed so that the adult subject to guardianship is capable of exercising
4 rights previously removed.
5 15-5-314. POWERS OF GUARDIAN FOR ADULT. (1) Except as limited by court
6 order, a guardian for an adult subject to guardianship may:
7 (a) Apply for and receive funds and benefits for the support of the
8 adult subject to guardianship, unless a conservator is appointed for
9 the adult subject to guardianship and the application or receipt is
10 within the powers of the conservator;
11 (b) Unless inconsistent with a court order, establish the adult subject
12 to guardianship's place of dwelling;
13 (c) Consent to health care or other care, treatment, or service for the
14 adult subject to guardianship;
15 (d) If a conservator for the adult subject to guardianship has not been
16 appointed, commence a proceeding, including an administrative proceed-
17 ing, or take other appropriate action to compel another person to sup-
18 port the adult subject to guardianship or pay funds for the adult sub-
19 ject to guardianship's benefit;
20 (e) To the extent reasonable, delegate to the adult subject to
21 guardianship responsibility for a decision affecting the adult subject
22 to guardianship's well-being; and
23 (f) Receive personally identifiable health care information regarding
24 the adult subject to guardianship.
25 (2) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult
26 subject to guardianship to consent to the adoption of the adult subject to
27 guardianship.
28 (3) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult
29 subject to guardianship to:
30 (a) Consent or withhold consent to the marriage of the adult subject to
31 guardianship if the adult subject to guardianship's right to marry has
32 been removed under section 15-5-310, Idaho Code;
33 (b) Petition for divorce, dissolution, or annulment of marriage of
34 the adult subject to guardianship or a declaration of invalidity of the
35 adult subject to guardianship's marriage; or
36 (c) Support or oppose a petition for divorce, dissolution, or annulment
37 of marriage of the adult subject to guardianship or a declaration of in-
38 validity of the adult subject to guardianship's marriage.
39 (4) In determining whether to authorize a power under subsection (2)
40 or (3) of this section, the court shall consider whether the underlying act
41 would be in accordance with the adult subject to guardianship's preferences,
42 values, and prior directions and whether the underlying act would be in the
43 adult subject to guardianship's best interest.
44 (5) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (1)(b) of this
45 section to establish the adult subject to guardianship's place of dwelling,
46 the guardian shall:
47 (a) Select a residential setting the guardian believes the adult sub-
48 ject to guardianship would select if the adult subject to guardianship
49 were able, in accordance with the decision-making standard in section
36
1 15-5-313(4) and (5), Idaho Code. If the guardian does not know and can-
2 not reasonably determine what setting the adult subject to guardianship
3 probably would choose if able, or the guardian reasonably believes the
4 decision the adult subject to guardianship would make would unreason-
5 ably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of
6 the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian shall choose in accor-
7 dance with section 15-5-313(5), Idaho Code, a residential setting that
8 is consistent with the adult subject to guardianship's best interest;
9 (b) In selecting among residential settings, give priority to a res-
10 idential setting in a location that will allow the adult subject to
11 guardianship to interact with persons important to the adult subject to
12 guardianship and meet the adult subject to guardianship's needs in the
13 least restrictive manner reasonably feasible unless to do so would be
14 inconsistent with the decision-making standard in section 15-5-313(4)
15 and (5), Idaho Code;
16 (c) No later than fourteen (14) days after a change in the dwelling of
17 the adult subject to guardianship:
18 (i) Give notice of the change to the court, the adult subject to
19 guardianship, and any person identified as entitled to the notice
20 in the court order appointing the guardian or a subsequent order;
21 and
22 (ii) Include in the notice the address and nature of the new
23 dwelling and state whether the adult subject to guardianship re-
24 ceived advance notice of the change and whether the adult subject
25 to guardianship objected to the change;
26 (d) Establish or move the permanent place of dwelling of the adult sub-
27 ject to guardianship to a nursing home, mental health facility, or other
28 facility that places restrictions on the adult subject to guardian-

30 (i) The establishment or move is in the guardian's plan under sec-
31 tion 15-5-316, Idaho Code;
32 (ii) The court authorizes the establishment or move; or
33 (iii) The guardian gives notice of the establishment or move at
34 least fourteen (14) days before the establishment or move to the
35 adult subject to guardianship and all persons entitled to notice
36 under section 15-5-310(5)(b), Idaho Code, or a subsequent order,
37 and no objection is filed;
38 (e) Establish or move the place of dwelling of the adult subject to
39 guardianship outside this state only if consistent with the guardian's
40 plan and authorized by the court by specific order; and
41 (f) Take action that would result in the sale of or surrender of the
42 lease to the primary dwelling of the adult subject to guardianship only
43 if:
44 (i) The action is specifically included in the guardian's plan
45 under section 15-5-316, Idaho Code;
46 (ii) The court authorizes the action by specific order; or
47 (iii) Notice of the action was given at least fourteen (14) days
48 before the action to the adult subject to guardianship and all per-
49 sons entitled to the notice under section 15-5-310(5)(b), Idaho
50 Code, or a subsequent order and no objection has been filed.
37
1 (6) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (1)(c) of this
2 section to make health care decisions, the guardian shall:
3 (a) Involve the adult subject to guardianship in decision-making to the
4 extent reasonably feasible, including, when practicable, by encourag-
5 ing and supporting the adult subject to guardianship in understanding
6 the risks and benefits of health care options;
7 (b) Defer to a decision by an agent under a medical directive executed
8 by the adult subject to guardianship and cooperate to the extent feasi-
9 ble with the agent making the decision; and
10 (c) Take into account:
11 (i) The risks and benefits of treatment options; and
12 (ii) The current and previous wishes and values of the adult sub-
13 ject to guardianship, if known or reasonably ascertainable by the
14 guardian.
15 15-5-315. SPECIAL LIMITATIONS ON GUARDIAN'S POWER. (1) Unless au-
16 thorized by the court by specific order, a guardian for an adult subject to
17 guardianship does not have the power to revoke or amend a medical directive
18 or power of attorney for finances executed by the adult subject to guardian-
19 ship. If a medical directive is in effect, unless there is a court order to
20 the contrary, a health care decision of an agent takes precedence over that
21 of the guardian and the guardian shall cooperate with the agent to the extent
22 feasible. If a power of attorney for finances is in effect, unless there
23 is a court order to the contrary, a decision by the agent that the agent is
24 authorized to make under the power of attorney for finances takes precedence
25 over that of the guardian and the guardian shall cooperate with the agent to
26 the extent feasible.
27 (2) A guardian for an adult subject to guardianship may not initiate the
28 commitment of the adult subject to guardianship to a mental health facility
29 except in accordance with the state's procedure for involuntary civil com-
30 mitment.
31 (3) A guardian for an adult subject to guardianship may not restrict
32 the ability of the adult subject to guardianship to communicate, visit, or
33 interact with others, including receiving visitors and making or receiving
34 telephone calls, personal mail, or electronic communications, including
35 through social media, or participating in social activities, unless:
36 (a) Authorized by the court by specific order;
37 (b) A protective order or a protective arrangement instead of guardian-
38 ship is in effect that limits contact between the adult subject to
39 guardianship and a person; or
40 (c) The guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
41 because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of signifi-
42 cant physical, psychological, or financial harm to the adult subject to
43 guardianship and the restriction is:
44 (i) For a period of not more than seven (7) business days if the
45 person has a family or preexisting social relationship with the
46 adult subject to guardianship; or
47 (ii) For a period of not more than sixty (60) days if the person
48 does not have a family or preexisting social relationship with the
49 adult subject to guardianship.
38
1 (4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section, a
2 guardian appointed for a person with a developmental disability shall have
3 no authority to refuse or withhold consent for medically necessary treatment
4 when the effect of withholding such treatment would seriously endanger the
5 life or health and well-being of the individual subject to guardianship.
6 To withhold or attempt to withhold consent for such treatment may be cause
7 for removal of the guardian. Except as otherwise provided in subsection
8 (8) of this section, no health care provider or caregiver shall, based on
9 such guardian's direction or refusal to consent to care, withhold or with-
10 draw such treatment for the individual subject to guardianship. If the
11 health care provider cannot obtain valid consent for such medically nec-
12 essary treatment from the guardian, the health care provider or caregiver
13 shall provide the medically necessary treatment as authorized by section
14 39-4504(1)(i), Idaho Code.
15 (5) A guardian appointed for a person with a developmental disability
16 may consent to withholding or withdrawing treatment other than appropri-
17 ate nutrition or hydration to the individual subject to guardianship, and
18 a health care provider may withhold or withdraw such treatment in reliance
19 on such consent, when in the reasonable medical judgment of the treating
20 licensed independent practitioner, as defined in section 39-4502(13), Idaho
21 Code, any of the following circumstances apply:
22 (a) The attending licensed independent practitioner and at least
23 one (1) other licensed independent practitioner certifies that the
24 individual subject to guardianship is chronically and irreversibly co-
25 matose;
26 (b) The treatment would merely prolong dying, would not be effective in
27 ameliorating or correcting all of the individual subject to guardian-
28 ship's life-threatening conditions, or would otherwise be futile in
29 terms of the survival of the individual subject to guardianship; or
30 (c) The treatment would be virtually futile in terms of the survival of
31 the individual subject to guardianship and would be inhumane under such
32 circumstances.
33 (6) Any person who has information that medically necessary treatment
34 of a individual subject to guardianship has been withheld or withdrawn in
35 violation of this section may report such information to adult protective
36 services or to the Idaho protection and advocacy system for people with de-
37 velopmental disabilities, which shall have the authority to investigate the
38 report and in appropriate cases to seek a court order to ensure that medi-
39 cally necessary treatment is provided. If adult protective services or the
40 protection and advocacy system determines that the withholding of medical
41 treatment violates the provisions of this section, it may petition the court
42 for an ex parte order to provide or continue the medical treatment in ques-
43 tion. If the court finds, based on affidavits or other evidence, that there
44 is probable cause to believe that the withholding of medical treatment in a
45 particular case violates the provisions of this section, and that the life or
46 health of the individual subject to guardianship is endangered thereby, the
47 court shall issue an ex parte order to continue or to provide the treatment
48 until such time as the court can hear evidence from the parties involved. Pe-
49 titions for court orders under this section shall be expedited by the courts
39
1 and heard as soon as possible. No bond shall be required of a petitioner un-
2 der this section.
3 (7) No partial or total guardian or partial or total conservator ap-
4 pointed under the provisions of this chapter may without specific approval
5 of the court in a proceeding separate from that in which such guardian or con-
6 servator was appointed:
7 (a) Consent to medical or surgical treatment, the effect of which per-
8 manently prohibits the conception of children by the individual subject
9 to guardianship unless the treatment or procedures are necessary to
10 protect the physical health of the individual subject to guardianship
11 and would be prescribed for a person who does not have a developmental
12 disability; or
13 (b) Consent to experimental surgery, procedures, or medications.
14 (8) Nothing in this section shall affect the rights of a competent per-
15 son or surrogate decision-maker to withhold or withdraw treatment pursuant
16 to section 39-4514, Idaho Code, unless the person is a respondent as defined
17 in this chapter.
18 15-5-316. GUARDIAN'S PLAN. A guardian's plan shall be done in accor-
19 dance with Idaho supreme court rules.
20 15-5-317. GUARDIAN'S REPORT -- MONITORING OF GUARDIANSHIP. A
21 guardian's report on care of the adult and monitoring of a guardianship shall
22 be done in accordance with Idaho supreme court rules.
23 15-5-318. REMOVAL OF GUARDIAN FOR ADULT -- APPOINTMENT OF SUCCES-
24 SOR. (1) The court may remove a guardian for an adult subject to guardianship
25 for failure to perform the guardian's duties or for other good cause and ap-
26 point a successor guardian to assume the duties of guardian.
27 (2) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to remove
28 a guardian for an adult subject to guardianship and appoint a successor
29 guardian upon:
30 (a) Petition of the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian, or a
31 person interested in the welfare of the adult subject to guardianship
32 that contains allegations that, if true, would support a reasonable
33 belief that removal of the guardian and appointment of a successor
34 guardian may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a hearing
35 if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was filed
36 during the preceding six (6) months;
37 (b) Communication from the adult subject to guardianship, the
38 guardian, or a person interested in the welfare of the adult subject
39 to guardianship that supports a reasonable belief that removal of the
40 guardian and appointment of a successor guardian may be appropriate; or
41 (c) Determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best in-
42 terest of the adult subject to guardianship.
43 (3) Notice of a petition under subsection (2)(a) of this section shall
44 be given to the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian, and any other
45 person as the court determines.
46 (4) An adult subject to guardianship who seeks to remove the guardian
47 and have a successor guardian appointed has the right to choose an attor-
40
1 ney to represent the adult subject to guardianship in this matter. If the
2 adult subject to guardianship is not represented by an attorney, the court
3 shall appoint an attorney under the same conditions as in section 15-5-305,
4 Idaho Code. The court shall award reasonable attorney's fees to the attorney
5 for the adult subject to guardianship as provided in section 15-5-119, Idaho
6 Code.
7 (5) In selecting a successor guardian for an adult subject to guardian-
8 ship, the court shall follow the priorities under section 15-5-309, Idaho
9 Code.
10 (6) No later than thirty (30) days after appointing a successor
11 guardian, the court shall give notice of the appointment to the adult subject
12 to guardianship and any person entitled to notice under section 15-5-310(5),
13 Idaho Code, or a subsequent order.
14 15-5-319. TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION OF GUARDIANSHIP FOR ADULT. (1)
15 An adult subject to guardianship, the guardian for the adult subject to
16 guardianship, or a person interested in the welfare of the adult subject to
17 guardianship may petition for:
18 (a) Termination of the guardianship on the grounds that a basis for
19 appointment under section 15-5-301, Idaho Code, does not exist or
20 that termination would be in the best interest of the adult subject to
21 guardianship or for other good cause; or
22 (b) Modification of the guardianship on the grounds that the extent of
23 protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good
24 cause.
25 (2) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination or
26 modification of a guardianship for an adult subject to guardianship is ap-
27 propriate upon:
28 (a) Petition under subsection (1) of this section that contains allega-
29 tions that, if true, would support a reasonable belief that termination
30 or modification of the guardianship may be appropriate, but the court
31 may decline to hold a hearing if a petition based on the same or substan-
32 tially similar facts was filed during the preceding six (6) months;
33 (b) Communication from the adult subject to guardianship, the
34 guardian, or a person interested in the welfare of the adult subject
35 to guardianship that supports a reasonable belief that termination or
36 modification of the guardianship may be appropriate, including because
37 the functional needs of the adult subject to guardianship or supports or
38 services available to the adult subject to guardianship have changed;
39 (c) A report from a guardian or conservator that indicates that ter-
40 mination or modification may be appropriate because the functional
41 needs of the adult subject to guardianship or supports or services
42 available to the adult subject to guardianship have changed or a pro-
43 tective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive
44 alternative for meeting the adult subject to guardianship's needs is
45 available; or
46 (d) A determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best in-
47 terest of the adult subject to guardianship.
41
1 (3) Notice of a petition under subsection (2)(a) of this section shall
2 be given to the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian, and any other
3 person as the court determines.
4 (4) Upon presentation of prima facie evidence for termination of a
5 guardianship for an adult subject to guardianship, the court shall order
6 termination unless it is proven that a basis for appointment of a guardian
7 under section 15-5-301, Idaho Code, exists.
8 (5) The court shall modify the powers granted to a guardian for an adult
9 subject to guardianship if the powers are excessive or inadequate due to a
10 change in the abilities or limitations of the adult subject to guardianship,
11 the adult subject to guardianship's supports, or other circumstances.
12 (6) Unless the court otherwise orders for good cause, before terminat-
13 ing or modifying a guardianship for an adult subject to guardianship, the
14 court shall follow the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the adult
15 subject to guardianship that apply to a petition for guardianship.
16 (7) An adult subject to guardianship who seeks to terminate or modify
17 the terms of the guardianship has the right to choose an attorney to repre-
18 sent the adult subject to guardianship in the matter. If the adult subject
19 to guardianship is not represented by an attorney, the court shall appoint an
20 attorney under the same conditions as in section 15-5-305, Idaho Code. The
21 court shall award reasonable attorney's fees to the attorney for the adult
22 subject to guardianship as provided in section 15-5-119, Idaho Code.
23 15-5-320. DESIGNATION OF BOARDS OF COMMUNITY GUARDIAN. After making
24 a determination that there exists a need within a county for a guardian for
25 those persons in need of guardianship and for whom there is no person or cor-
26 poration qualified and willing to act in such capacity, the board of county
27 commissioners may create and budget for, within the county, a board of commu-
28 nity guardian. The board of county commissioners of one (1) or more counties
29 within a judicial district may jointly create and budget for a board of com-
30 munity guardian within that district.
31 15-5-321. BOARD OF COMMUNITY GUARDIAN STRUCTURE -- POWERS AND DU-
32 TIES. (1) Any board of community guardian that is created within a county or
33 counties in a judicial district shall operate under the laws of the state of
34 Idaho, including the Idaho guardianship, conservatorship, and trust laws.
35 (2) A board of community guardian shall consist of no fewer than seven
36 (7) and no more than eleven (11) members who are representatives of commu-
37 nity interests involving persons needing guardians or conservators as de-
38 fined in this chapter. Members shall be appointed by the board of county com-
39 missioners that created the board of community guardian under section 15-5-
40 320, Idaho Code.
41 (3) The terms of the members of the board shall be for four (4) years and
42 shall be staggered. A number of members equaling or most closely exceeding
43 fifty percent (50%) shall initially be appointed for three (3) years. Any
44 vacancy created by resignation or expiration of term shall be filled in the
45 same manner as the original appointment.
46 (4) A member shall continue to serve on the board until that person's
47 successor is appointed.
48 (5) The board shall meet not less than once each quarter.
42
1 (6) No person shall be a member of a board who is also an employee of the
2 district court or the clerk of the district court in the judicial district
3 where the board is formed.
4 (7) A board member having previously provided or currently providing
5 services to a person under guardianship shall disclose such to the board and
6 abstain from any decision or action taken concerning that particular person
7 under guardianship.
8 (8) Board members and officers shall serve without pay.
9 (9) Each board shall elect its own chairman and other officers.
10 (10) A board, in those instances when a guardian or conservator is re-
11 quired and no qualified family member or other qualified person has volun-
12 teered to serve, may:
13 (a) Locate a qualified person to serve as guardian or conservator; or
14 (b) Petition the court to be appointed as guardian or conservator.
15 (11) The board shall have all the powers and duties where applicable by
16 court order and other provisions of this chapter and in addition shall:
17 (a) Locate and recommend to the court, where necessary, that a visitor
18 be appointed;
19 (b) Have access to all confidential records, including abuse reg-
20 istry reports that may be maintained by state or private agencies or
21 institutions, which records concern a person for whom the board acts as
22 guardian or conservator. The name of the person reporting the alleged
23 abuse shall be subject to disclosure according to the provisions of
24 chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code;
25 (c) Review and monitor the services provided by public and private
26 agencies to any individual subject to guardianship or conservatorship
27 for whom the board acts as guardian or conservator and determine the
28 continued need for those services;
29 (d) Assess a fee for services developed pursuant to this part; and
30 (e) Have the power, subject to the approval of the board of county com-
31 missioners, to adopt such rules as are necessary to carry out the duties
32 and responsibilities of the board.
33 (12) When a board serves as guardian or conservator, it shall be compen-
34 sated as other guardians or conservators pursuant to Idaho law. If, at the
35 time the board is appointed as guardian or conservator, the person for whom
36 the board is to act has no funds, the court may waive the payment of fees.
37 (13) When a board serves as guardian or conservator, there is created,
38 at the time of filing of the order of appointment, a lien in favor of the board
39 against any real property owned by the individual subject to guardianship or
40 conservatorship, enforceable only upon the termination of the guardianship
41 or conservatorship, for all fees that were incurred throughout the duration
42 of the services and that were not paid prior to termination. All fees in-
43 curred throughout the duration of the services and that were not paid prior
44 to the termination of services shall relate back to the effective date of the
45 lien. The board shall record a notice of said lien within thirty (30) days
46 of filing of the order of appointment. Such liens shall be recorded in every
47 county where property subject to the lien is located. The notice shall con-
48 tain at least the following information:
49 (a) Full court heading of the action in which the appointment was made;
50 (b) The effective date of the lien;
43
1 (c) The name and address of the board; and
2 (d) Any limitations or terms regarding the fees covered by the lien con-
3 tained in the order of appointment.
4 (14) The court may postpone or arrange for gradual repayment of the fees
5 if the court finds that the immediate repayment would create a hardship on
6 the individual subject to guardianship.
7 (15) No member of a board of community guardian, employee of the board,
8 or visitor appointed at the request of such board shall be liable for civil
9 damages by reason of authorizing medical treatment or surgery for the person
10 for whom the board is appointed, if the board member, employee, or visitor,
11 after medical consultation with the person's physician, acts in good faith,
12 is not negligent, and acts within the limits established for the guardian or
13 conservator by the court. No such person shall be liable, by reason of his
14 authorization, for injury to the person for whom the guardian or conservator
15 has been appointed, which injury results from the negligence or other acts
16 of a third person, if the court has authorized the giving of medical consent
17 by the board or the individual members of the board. No such person shall be
18 liable in the performance of acts done in good faith within the scope of his
19 authority as long as the act is not of a wanton or grossly negligent nature.
20 The board of community guardian shall be deemed to be a governmental entity
21 for the purposes of application of the Idaho tort claims act.
22 15-5-322. BOARD OF COMMUNITY GUARDIAN ANNUAL REPORT. (1) Each board of
23 community guardian shall report annually in writing to the board of county
24 commissioners, and in the case of a multicounty board, to each participating
25 county, its activities for the preceding year, which report shall contain:
26 (a) A fiscal report that adequately reflects the financial operation of
27 the board;
28 (b) The number of volunteer guardians obtained by the board;
29 (c) The number of persons for whom the board is acting as guardian;
30 (d) Recommendations for improving guardianship services in the dis-

33 community guardian or the board of county commissioners.
34 (2) The report shall be filed no later than April 1 of each year and
35 shall cover the preceding calendar year.
36 (3) The board of county commissioners shall review each report and
37 shall determine whether to dissolve or continue the board of community
38 guardian in the county. Where there is a multicounty board of community
39 guardian, the boards of county commissioners of all concerned counties shall
40 concur in a decision to dissolve the board of community guardian.
41 SECTION 6. That Chapter 5, Title 15, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
42 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW PART, to be known and desig-
43 nated as Part 4, Chapter 5, Title 15, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
44 PART 4
45 CONSERVATORSHIP
46 15-5-401. BASIS FOR APPOINTMENT OF CONSERVATOR. (1) Upon petition and
47 after notice and hearing, the court may appoint a conservator for the prop-
44
1 erty or financial affairs of a minor if the court finds by a preponderance of
2 evidence that appointment of a conservator is in the minor's best interest,
3 and:
4 (a) If the minor has a parent, the court gives weight to any recommenda-
5 tion of the parent whether an appointment is in the minor's best inter-
6 est; and
7 (b) Either:
8 (i) The minor owns funds or other property requiring management
9 or protection that otherwise cannot be provided;
10 (ii) The minor has or may have financial affairs that may be put at
11 unreasonable risk or hindered because of the minor's age; or
12 (iii) Appointment is necessary or desirable to obtain or provide
13 funds or other property needed for the support, care, education,
14 health, or welfare of the minor.
15 (2) Upon petition and after notice and hearing, the court may appoint
16 a conservator for the property or financial affairs of a respondent if the
17 court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
18 (a) The respondent is unable to manage property or financial affairs
19 because:
20 (i) The respondent is limited in ability to receive and evaluate
21 information or make or communicate decisions, even with the use
22 of appropriate supportive services, technological assistance, or
23 supported decision-making; or
24 (ii) The respondent is missing, detained, or unable to return to
25 the United States;
26 (b) Appointment is necessary to:
27 (i) Avoid harm to the respondent or significant dissipation of
28 the property of the respondent; or
29 (ii) Obtain or provide funds or other property needed for the sup-
30 port, care, education, health, or welfare of the respondent or of
31 an individual entitled to the respondent's support; and

33 rangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive alter-
34 native.
35 (3) The court shall grant a conservator only those powers necessitated
36 by demonstrated limitations and needs of the respondent and issue orders
37 that will encourage development of the respondent's maximum self-determina-
38 tion and independence. The court may not establish a full conservatorship
39 if a limited conservatorship, protective arrangement instead of conserva-
40 torship, or other less restrictive alternative would meet the needs of the
41 respondent.
42 15-5-402. PETITION FOR APPOINTMENT OF CONSERVATOR. (1) The following
43 may petition for the appointment of a conservator:
44 (a) The respondent for whom the order is sought;

43 tion.

8 15-5-402(2)(a) through (c), Idaho Code, and any other person interested in
9 the respondent's welfare as the court determines. Failure to give notice
10 under the provisions of this subsection does not preclude the court from
11 appointing a conservator.

39 the order listed:
40 (a) An individual or person nominated by the respondent if the respon-

44 dent in the financial power of attorney for the respondent, or if no such
45 nomination is made therein, the individual or person nominated as agent
46 therein, provided that:
47 (i) If co-conservators or co-agents, as appropriate, are nomi-
48 nated, the court may consider whether appointment of co-conserva-
50
1 tors is in the best interest of the respondent or whether a sole
2 conservator should be appointed;
3 (ii) If several individuals or persons are nominated in order of
4 priority, the court shall consider such nominations in that order
5 of priority; and
6 (iii) If more than one (1) financial power of attorney made by
7 the respondent exists, the court shall determine which financial
8 power of attorney is appropriate to be the basis for nomination of
9 a conservator;
10 (c) The spouse of the respondent;
11 (d) An adult child of the respondent;
12 (e) A conservator, guardian of property, or other like fiduciary, but
13 not a fiduciary serving only as a trustee, appointed or recognized by

22 (2) A person in priority of subsection (1)(c) through (g) of this sec-
23 tion may nominate in writing a person to serve in his stead. With respect
24 to persons having equal priority, the court is to select the one who is best
25 qualified of those willing to serve. The court for good cause may pass over a
26 person having priority and appoint a person having less priority or no prior-
27 ity.
28 (3) No convicted felon shall be appointed as a conservator of the estate
29 of a respondent unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that
30 such appointment is in the best interest of the respondent.

32 vidual who is employed by a person that provides paid services to the respon-
33 dent, or is the spouse, parent, or child of an individual who provides or is
34 employed to provide paid services to the respondent, may not be appointed as
35 conservator unless:
36 (a) The individual is related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or
37 adoption; or
38 (b) The court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is
39 the best qualified person available for appointment and the appointment
40 is in the best interest of the respondent.

42 which the respondent is receiving care may not be appointed as conservator

45 15-5-411. ORDER OF APPOINTMENT OF CONSERVATOR. (1) A court order
46 appointing a conservator for a minor shall include findings to support ap-

2 shall:

5 by a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less
6 restrictive alternative, including use of appropriate supportive ser-
7 vices, technological assistance, or supported decision-making; and
8 (b) Include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence es-
9 tablished the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on the
10 petition.
11 (3) A court order establishing a full conservatorship for an individ-
12 ual subject to conservatorship shall state the basis for granting a full con-
13 servatorship and include specific findings to support the conclusion that a
14 limited conservatorship would not meet the functional needs of the individ-
15 ual subject to conservatorship.
16 (4) A court order establishing a limited conservatorship shall state
17 the specific property placed under the control of the conservator and the
18 powers granted to the conservator.

29 servator's duties for more than one (1) month;

40 (6) If an individual subject to conservatorship is an adult, the spouse
41 and adult children of the individual subject to conservatorship are entitled
42 under subsection (5) of this section to notice unless the court determines
43 notice would be contrary to the preferences or prior directions of the indi-
44 vidual subject to conservatorship or not in the best interest of the individ-
45 ual subject to conservatorship.
46 (7) If the individual subject to conservatorship is a minor, each par-
47 ent and adult sibling of the minor is entitled under subsection (5) of this

15 (a) In a form and manner that is accessible and understandable by the
16 recipient, through the use of assistive technology if necessary;
17 (b) In plain language; and
18 (c) To the extent feasible, in a language in which the recipient is pro-
19 ficient.
20 (3) A statement issued under subsection (2) of this section shall no-

34 conservatorship is not required.
35 15-5-413. EMERGENCY CONSERVATOR. (1) On its own, or upon petition by a
36 person interested in a respondent's welfare after a petition has been filed
37 under section 15-5-402, Idaho Code, the court may appoint an emergency con-
38 servator for the respondent if the court finds:
39 (a) Appointment of an emergency conservator is likely to prevent sub-
40 stantial and irreparable harm to the respondent's property or financial
41 interests;
42 (b) No other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in
43 the circumstances; and
44 (c) There is reason to believe that a basis for appointment of a conser-
45 vator under section 15-5-401, Idaho Code, exists.
46 (2) The duration of authority of an emergency conservator may not ex-
47 ceed ninety (90) days, and the emergency conservator may exercise only the
48 powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency conservator's
49 authority may be extended once for not more than ninety (90) days if the court
53
1 finds that the conditions for appointment of an emergency conservator under
2 subsection (1) of this section continue.
3 (3) Immediately upon filing of a petition for an emergency conserva-
4 tor, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the respondent in the
5 proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section,
6 reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of a hearing on the petition
7 shall be given to the respondent, the respondent's attorney, and any other
8 person as the court determines.
9 (4) The court may appoint an emergency conservator without notice to
10 the respondent and any attorney for the respondent only if the court finds
11 from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's property or financial
12 interests will be substantially and irreparably harmed before a hearing with
13 notice on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emergency
14 conservator without giving notice under subsection (3) of this section, the
15 court shall give notice of the appointment not later than forty-eight (48)
16 hours after the appointment to:
17 (a) The respondent;
18 (b) The respondent's attorney; and
19 (c) Any other person as the court determines.
20 (5) Not later than seven (7) days after the appointment, the court shall
21 hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment.
22 (6) Appointment of an emergency conservator under this section is not
23 a determination that a basis exists for appointment of a conservator under
24 section 15-5-401, Idaho Code.
25 (7) The court may remove an emergency conservator appointed under this
26 section at any time. The emergency conservator shall make any report the
27 court requires.
28 15-5-414. POWERS OF CONSERVATOR REQUIRING COURT APPROVAL. (1) Except
29 as otherwise ordered by the court, a conservator shall give notice to per-
30 sons entitled to notice under section 15-5-403(4), Idaho Code, and receive
31 specific authorization by the court before the conservator may exercise with
32 respect to the conservatorship the power to:
33 (a) Make a gift, except a gift of de minimis value;
34 (b) Sell, encumber an interest in, or surrender a lease to the primary
35 dwelling of the individual subject to conservatorship;
36 (c) Convey, release, or disclaim a contingent or expectant interest in
37 property, including marital property, and any right of survivorship in-
38 cident to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety or community property
39 with right of survivorship;
40 (d) Exercise or release a power of appointment;
41 (e) Create a revocable or irrevocable trust of property of the conser-
42 vatorship estate, whether or not the trust extends beyond the duration
43 of the conservatorship, or revoke or amend a trust revocable by the in-
44 dividual subject to conservatorship;
45 (f) Exercise a right to elect an option or change a beneficiary under an
46 insurance policy or annuity or surrender the policy or annuity for its
47 cash value;
54
1 (g) Exercise a right to an elective share in the estate of a deceased
2 spouse of the individual subject to conservatorship or renounce or dis-
3 claim a property interest;
4 (h) Grant a creditor priority for payment over creditors of the same or
5 higher class if the creditor is providing property or services used to
6 meet the basic living and care needs of the individual subject to con-
7 servatorship and preferential treatment otherwise would be impermissi-
8 ble under section 15-5-428(5), Idaho Code; and
9 (i) Acquire an undivided interest in property in which the conservator,
10 in a fiduciary capacity, holds an undivided interest.
11 (2) In approving a conservator's exercise of a power listed in subsec-
12 tion (1) of this section, the court shall consider primarily the decision the
13 individual subject to conservatorship would make if able, to the extent the
14 decision can be ascertained.
15 (3) To determine under subsection (2) of this section the decision the
16 individual subject to conservatorship would make if able, the court shall
17 consider the individual subject to conservatorship's prior or current di-
18 rections, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to the extent actu-
19 ally known or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator. The court also
20 shall consider:
21 (a) The financial needs of the individual subject to conservatorship
22 and individuals who are in fact dependent on the individual subject to
23 conservatorship for support, and the interests of creditors of the in-
24 dividual subject to conservatorship;
25 (b) Possible reduction of income, estate, inheritance, or other tax li-
26 abilities;
27 (c) Eligibility for governmental assistance;
28 (d) The previous pattern of giving or level of support provided by the
29 individual subject to conservatorship;
30 (e) Any existing estate plan or lack of estate plan of the individual
31 subject to conservatorship;
32 (f) The life expectancy of the individual subject to conservatorship
33 and the probability the conservatorship will terminate before the indi-
34 vidual subject to conservatorship's death; and
35 (g) Any other relevant factor.
36 (4) A conservator may not revoke or amend a power of attorney for fi-
37 nances executed by the individual subject to conservatorship. If a power of
38 attorney for finances is in effect, a decision of the agent takes precedence
39 over that of the conservator, unless the court orders otherwise.

41 to conservatorship or a person interested in the welfare of the individual
42 subject to conservatorship may petition for an order:

47 ship estate;

6 needs, including because the individual subject to conservatorship's abili-
7 ties or supports have changed;
8 (6) Rejecting or modifying the conservator's plan under section 15-5-
9 419, Idaho Code, the conservator's inventory under section 15-5-420, Idaho
10 Code, or the conservator's report under section 15-5-423, Idaho Code; or
11 (7) Granting other appropriate relief.
12 15-5-416. BOND -- ALTERNATIVE ASSET-PROTECTION ARRANGEMENT. (1) Ex-
13 cept as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, the court shall
14 require a conservator to furnish a bond with a surety the court specifies, or
15 require an alternative asset-protection arrangement, conditioned on faith-
16 ful discharge of all duties of the conservator. The court may waive the re-
17 quirement only if the court finds that a bond or other asset-protection ar-
18 rangement is not necessary to protect the interests of the individual sub-
19 ject to conservatorship. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of
20 this section, the court may not waive the requirement if the conservator is
21 in the business of serving as a conservator and is being paid for the service.
22 (2) Unless the court directs otherwise, the bond required under this
23 section shall be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the conser-
24 vatorship estate, plus one (1) year's estimated income, less the value of
25 property deposited under an arrangement requiring a court order for its re-
26 moval and real property the conservator lacks power to sell or convey without
27 specific court authorization. The court, in place of surety on a bond, may
28 accept collateral for the performance of the bond, including a pledge of se-
29 curities or a mortgage of real property.
30 (3) A regulated financial-service institution qualified to do trust
31 business in this state is not required to give a bond under this section.
32 15-5-417. TERMS AND REQUIREMENTS OF BOND. (1) The following rules ap-
33 ply to the bond required under section 15-5-416, Idaho Code:
34 (a) Except as otherwise provided by the bond, the surety and the conser-
35 vator are jointly and severally liable;
36 (b) By executing a bond provided by a conservator, the surety submits
37 to the personal jurisdiction of the court that issued letters of office
38 to the conservator in a proceeding relating to the duties of the conser-
39 vator in which the surety is named as a party. Notice of the proceeding
40 shall be given to the surety at the address shown in the records of the
41 court in which the bond is filed and any other address of the surety then
42 known to the person required to provide the notice;
43 (c) Upon petition of a successor conservator or person affected by
44 a breach of the obligation of the bond, a proceeding may be brought
45 against the surety for breach of the obligation of the bond; and
46 (d) A proceeding against the bond may be brought until liability under
47 the bond is exhausted.
56
1 (2) A proceeding may not be brought under this section against a surety
2 of a bond on a matter as to which a proceeding against the conservator is
3 barred.
4 (3) If a bond under section 15-5-416, Idaho Code, is not renewed by the
5 conservator, the surety or sureties immediately shall give notice to the
6 court and the individual subject to conservatorship.
7 15-5-418. DUTIES OF CONSERVATOR. (1) A conservator is a fiduciary and
8 has duties of prudence and loyalty to the individual subject to conservator-
9 ship.
10 (2) A conservator shall promote the self-determination of the individ-
11 ual subject to conservatorship and, to the extent feasible, encourage the
12 individual subject to conservatorship to participate in decisions, act on
13 the individual subject to conservatorship's own behalf, and develop or re-
14 gain the capacity to manage the individual subject to conservatorship's per-
15 sonal affairs.
16 (3) In making a decision for an individual subject to conservatorship,
17 the conservator shall make the decision the conservator reasonably believes
18 the individual subject to conservatorship would make if able, unless doing
19 so would fail to preserve the resources needed to maintain the individual
20 subject to conservatorship's well-being and lifestyle or otherwise unrea-
21 sonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of
22 the individual subject to conservatorship. To determine the decision the
23 individual subject to conservatorship would make if able, the conservator
24 shall consider the individual subject to conservatorship's prior or current
25 directions, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to the extent actu-
26 ally known or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator.
27 (4) If a conservator cannot make a decision under subsection (3) of
28 this section because the conservator does not know and cannot reasonably
29 determine the decision the individual subject to conservatorship probably
30 would make if able, or the conservator reasonably believes the decision the
31 individual subject to conservatorship would make would fail to preserve
32 resources needed to maintain the individual subject to conservatorship's
33 well-being and lifestyle or otherwise unreasonably harm or endanger the
34 welfare or personal or financial interests of the individual subject to con-
35 servatorship, the conservator shall act in accordance with the best interest
36 of the individual subject to conservatorship. In determining the best in-
37 terest of the individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator shall
38 consider:
39 (a) Information received from professionals and persons that demon-
40 strate sufficient interest in the welfare of the individual subject to
41 conservatorship;
42 (b) Other information the conservator believes the individual subject
43 to conservatorship would have considered if the individual subject to
44 conservatorship were able to act; and
45 (c) Other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the in-
46 dividual subject to conservatorship would consider, including conse-
47 quences for others.
57
1 (5) Except when inconsistent with the conservator's duties under sub-
2 sections (1) through (4) of this section, a conservator shall invest and man-
3 age the conservatorship estate as a prudent investor would, by considering:
4 (a) The circumstances of the individual subject to conservatorship and
5 the conservatorship estate;
6 (b) General economic conditions;
7 (c) The possible effect of inflation or deflation;
8 (d) The expected tax consequences of an investment decision or strat-
9 egy;
10 (e) The role of each investment or course of action in relation to the
11 conservatorship estate as a whole;
12 (f) The expected total return from income and appreciation of capital;
13 (g) The need for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation or
14 appreciation of capital; and
15 (h) The special relationship or value, if any, of specific property to
16 the individual subject to conservatorship.
17 (6) The propriety of a conservator's investment and management of the
18 conservatorship estate is determined in light of the facts and circumstances
19 existing when the conservator decides or acts and not by hindsight.
20 (7) A conservator shall make a reasonable effort to verify facts rele-
21 vant to the investment and management of the conservatorship estate.
22 (8) A conservator that has special skills or expertise, or is named con-
23 servator in reliance on the conservator's representation of special skills
24 or expertise, has a duty to use the special skills or expertise in carrying
25 out the conservator's duties.
26 (9) In investing, selecting specific property for distribution, and
27 invoking a power of revocation or withdrawal for the use or benefit of the
28 individual subject to conservatorship, a conservator shall consider any es-
29 tate plan of the individual subject to conservatorship known or reasonably
30 ascertainable to the conservator and may examine the will or other donative,
31 nominative, or appointive instrument of the individual.
32 (10) A conservator shall maintain insurance on the insurable real and
33 personal property of the individual subject to conservatorship, unless the
34 conservatorship estate lacks sufficient funds to pay for insurance or the
35 court finds:
36 (a) The property lacks sufficient equity; or
37 (b) Insuring the property would unreasonably dissipate the conserva-
38 torship estate or otherwise not be in the best interest of the individ-
39 ual subject to conservatorship.
40 (11) If a power of attorney for finances is in effect, a conservator
41 shall cooperate with the agent to the extent feasible.
42 (12) A conservator has access to and authority over a digital asset of
43 the individual subject to conservatorship to the extent provided in chapter
44 14, title 15, Idaho Code, the revised uniform fiduciary access to digital as-
45 sets act, or court order.
46 (13) A conservator for an adult individual subject to conservatorship
47 shall notify the court if the condition of the adult individual subject to
48 conservatorship has changed so that the adult individual subject to conser-
49 vatorship is capable of exercising rights previously removed. The notice
50 shall be given immediately on learning of the change.
58
1 15-5-419. CONSERVATOR'S PLAN. A plan required of a conservator ap-
2 pointed pursuant to this part shall conform to Idaho supreme court rules.

4 after appointment, a conservator shall prepare and file with the appointing
5 court a detailed inventory of the conservatorship estate, together with an
6 oath or affirmation that the inventory is believed to be complete and accu-
7 rate as far as information permits.
8 (2) A conservator shall give notice of the filing of an inventory to the
9 individual subject to conservatorship, any person entitled to notice under
10 section 15-5-411(5), Idaho Code, or a subsequent order, and any other person
11 as the court determines. The notice shall be given not later than seven (7)
12 days after the filing.
13 (3) A conservator shall keep records of the administration of the con-
14 servatorship estate and make them available for examination upon reasonable
15 request of the individual subject to conservatorship, a guardian for the in-
16 dividual subject to conservatorship, or any other person as the conservator
17 or the court determines.
18 15-5-421. ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF CONSERVATOR NOT REQUIRING COURT
19 APPROVAL. (1) Except as otherwise provided in section 15-5-414, Idaho Code,
20 or qualified or limited in the court's order of appointment and stated in the
21 letters of office, a conservator has all powers granted in this section and
22 any additional power granted to a trustee by law of this state other than this
23 chapter.
24 (2) A conservator, acting reasonably and consistent with the fiduciary

12 tent with the conservator's duties; and
13 (y) Execute and deliver any instrument that will accomplish or facili-

15 15-5-422. DISTRIBUTION FROM CONSERVATORSHIP ESTATE. Except as other-
16 wise provided in section 15-5-414, Idaho Code, or qualified or limited in
17 the court's order of appointment and stated in the letters of conservator-
18 ship, and unless contrary to a conservator's plan under section 15-5-419,
19 Idaho Code, the conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of
20 the conservatorship estate without specific court authorization or confir-
21 mation for the support, care, education, health, or welfare of the individ-
22 ual subject to conservatorship or an individual who is in fact dependent on
23 the individual subject to conservatorship, including the payment of child or
24 spousal support, in accordance with the following rules:
25 (1) The conservator shall consider a recommendation relating to the ap-
26 propriate standard of support, care, education, health, or welfare for the
27 individual subject to conservatorship or individual who is dependent on the
28 individual subject to conservatorship, made by a guardian for the individual
29 subject to conservatorship, if any, and, if the individual subject to con-
30 servatorship is a minor, a recommendation made by a parent of the minor.
31 (2) The conservator acting in compliance with the conservator's duties
32 under section 15-5-418, Idaho Code, is not liable for an expenditure or dis-
33 tribution made based on a recommendation under subsection (1) of this sec-
34 tion unless the conservator knows or should have known the expenditure or
35 distribution is not in the best interest of the individual subject to conser-
36 vatorship.
37 (3) In making an expenditure or distribution under this section, the
38 conservator shall consider:
39 (a) The size of the conservatorship estate, the estimated duration
40 of the conservatorship, and the likelihood the individual subject to
41 conservatorship, at some future time, may be fully self-sufficient and
42 able to manage the individual subject to conservatorship's financial
43 affairs and the conservatorship estate;
44 (b) The accustomed standard of living of the individual subject to con-
45 servatorship and an individual who is dependent on the individual sub-
46 ject to conservatorship;
47 (c) Other funds or sources used for the support of the individual sub-
48 ject to conservatorship; and
61
1 (d) The preferences, values, and prior directions of the individual
2 subject to conservatorship.
3 (4) Funds expended or distributed under this section may be paid by the
4 conservator to any person, including the individual subject to conservator-
5 ship, as reimbursement for expenditures the conservator might have made, or
6 in advance for services to be provided to the individual subject to conserva-
7 torship or an individual who is dependent on the individual subject to con-
8 servatorship if it is reasonable to expect the services will be performed
9 and advance payment is customary or reasonably necessary under the circum-
10 stances.
11 15-5-423. CONSERVATOR'S REPORT AND ACCOUNTING -- MONITORING. A con-
12 servator's report and accounting and the monitoring of a conservatorship
13 shall be done in accordance with Idaho supreme court rules.
14 15-5-424. ATTEMPTED TRANSFER OF PROPERTY BY INDIVIDUAL SUBJECT TO
15 CONSERVATORSHIP. (1) The interest of an individual subject to conservator-
16 ship in property included in the conservatorship estate is not transferable
17 or assignable by the individual subject to conservatorship and is not
18 subject to levy, garnishment, or similar process for claims against the in-
19 dividual subject to conservatorship unless allowed under section 15-5-428,
20 Idaho Code.
21 (2) If an individual subject to conservatorship enters into a contract
22 after having the right to enter the contract removed by the court, the con-
23 tract is void against the individual subject to conservatorship and the in-
24 dividual subject to conservatorship's property but is enforceable against
25 the person that contracted with the individual subject to conservatorship.
26 (3) A person other than the conservator that deals with an individual
27 subject to conservatorship with respect to property included in the con-
28 servatorship estate is entitled to protection provided by law of this state
29 other than this chapter.
30 15-5-425. TRANSACTION INVOLVING CONFLICT OF INTEREST. A transaction
31 involving a conservatorship estate that is affected by a substantial con-
32 flict between the conservator's fiduciary duties and personal interests is
33 voidable unless the transaction is authorized by court order after notice to
34 persons entitled to notice under section 15-5-411(5), Idaho Code, or a sub-
35 sequent order. A transaction affected by a substantial conflict includes a
36 sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving the conservatorship es-
37 tate entered into by the conservator, an individual with whom the conserva-
38 tor resides, the spouse, descendant, sibling, agent, or attorney of the con-
39 servator, or a corporation or other enterprise in which the conservator has a
40 substantial beneficial interest.
41 15-5-426. PROTECTION OF PERSON DEALING WITH CONSERVATOR. (1) A person
42 that assists or deals with a conservator in good faith and for value in any
43 transaction, other than a transaction requiring a court order under section
44 15-5-414, Idaho Code, is protected as though the conservator properly exer-
45 cised any power in question. Knowledge by a person that the person is deal-
46 ing with a conservator alone does not require the person to inquire into the
62
1 existence of authority of the conservator or the propriety of the conserva-
2 tor's exercise of authority, but restrictions on authority stated in letters
3 of office, or otherwise provided by law, are effective as to the person. A
4 person that pays or delivers property to a conservator is not responsible for
5 proper application of the property.
6 (2) Protection under subsection (1) of this section extends to a pro-
7 cedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the proceeding leading to
8 the issuance of letters of office and does not substitute for protection for
9 a person that assists or deals with a conservator provided by comparable pro-
10 visions in law of this state other than this chapter relating to a commercial
11 transaction or simplifying a transfer of securities by a fiduciary.
12 15-5-427. DEATH OF INDIVIDUAL SUBJECT TO CONSERVATORSHIP. (1) If an
13 individual subject to conservatorship dies, the conservator shall deliver
14 to the court for safekeeping any will of the individual subject to conserva-
15 torship in the conservator's possession and inform the personal representa-
16 tive named in the will if feasible, or if not feasible, a beneficiary named in
17 the will, of the delivery.
18 (2) If forty (40) days after the death of an individual subject to con-
19 servatorship no personal representative has been appointed and no applica-
20 tion or petition for appointment is before the court, the conservator may ap-
21 ply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative to admin-
22 ister and distribute the decedent's estate. The conservator shall give no-
23 tice to a person nominated as personal representative by a will of the dece-
24 dent of which the conservator is aware. The court may grant the application
25 if there is no objection and endorse the letters of office to note that the
26 individual formerly subject to conservatorship is deceased and the conser-
27 vator has acquired the powers and duties of a personal representative.
28 (3) Issuance of an order under this section has the effect of an order
29 of appointment of a personal representative under section 15-3-307, Idaho
30 Code, and parts 6 through 10 of chapter 3, title 15, Idaho Code.
31 (4) Upon the death of an individual subject to conservatorship, the
32 conservator shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship estate
33 as provided in section 15-5-431, Idaho Code.
34 15-5-428. PRESENTATION AND ALLOWANCE OF CLAIM. (1) A conservator may
35 pay, or secure by encumbering property included in the conservatorship es-
36 tate, a claim against the conservatorship estate or the individual subject
37 to conservatorship arising before or during the conservatorship upon pre-
38 sentation and allowance in accordance with the priorities under subsection
39 (4) of this section. A claimant may present a claim by:
40 (a) Sending or delivering to the conservator a statement in a record of
41 the claim, indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant,
42 and the amount claimed; or
43 (b) Filing the claim with the court, in a form acceptable to the court,
44 and sending or delivering a copy of the claim to the conservator.
45 (2) A claim under subsection (1) of this section is presented on receipt
46 by the conservator of the statement of the claim or the filing with the court
47 of the claim, whichever first occurs. A presented claim is allowed if it is
48 not disallowed in whole or in part by the conservator in a record sent or de-
63
1 livered to the claimant not later than sixty (60) days after its presenta-
2 tion. Before payment, the conservator may change an allowance of the claim
3 to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a court
4 order or order directing payment of the claim. Presentation of a claim tolls
5 the running of a statute of limitations that has not expired relating to the
6 claim until thirty (30) days after its disallowance.
7 (3) A claimant whose claim under subsection (1) of this section has not
8 been paid may petition the court to determine the claim at any time before it
9 is barred by a statute of limitations, and the court may order its allowance,
10 payment, or security by encumbering property included in the conservator-
11 ship estate. If a proceeding is pending against the individual subject to
12 conservatorship at the time of appointment of the conservator or is initi-
13 ated thereafter, the moving party shall give the conservator notice of the
14 proceeding if it could result in creating a claim against the conservator-
15 ship estate.
16 (4) If a conservatorship estate is likely to be exhausted before all ex-
17 isting claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in money
18 or in kind in payment of claims in the following order:
19 (a) Costs and expenses of administration;
20 (b) A claim of the federal or state government having priority under law
21 other than this chapter;
22 (c) A claim incurred by the conservator for support, care, education,
23 health, or welfare previously provided to the individual subject to
24 conservatorship or an individual who is in fact dependent on the indi-
25 vidual subject to conservatorship;
26 (d) A claim arising before the conservatorship; and
27 (e) All other claims.
28 (5) Preference may not be given in the payment of a claim under subsec-
29 tion (4) of this section over another claim of the same class. A claim due and
30 payable may not be preferred over a claim not due unless:
31 (a) Doing so would leave the conservatorship estate without sufficient
32 funds to pay the basic living and health care expenses of the individual
33 subject to conservatorship; and
34 (b) The court authorizes the preference under section 15-5-414(1)(h),
35 Idaho Code.
36 (6) If assets of a conservatorship estate are adequate to meet all ex-
37 isting claims, the court, acting in the best interest of the individual sub-
38 ject to conservatorship, may order the conservator to grant a security in-
39 terest in the conservatorship estate for payment of a claim at a future date.
40 15-5-429. PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CONSERVATOR. (1) Except as otherwise
41 agreed by a conservator, the conservator is not personally liable for a con-
42 tract properly entered into in a fiduciary capacity in the course of adminis-
43 tration of the conservatorship estate unless the conservator fails to reveal
44 the conservator's representative capacity in the contract or before enter-
45 ing into the contract.
46 (2) A conservator is personally liable for an obligation arising from
47 control of property of the conservatorship estate or an act or omission oc-
48 curring in the course of administration of the conservatorship estate only
49 if the conservator is personally at fault.
64
1 (3) A claim based on a contract entered into by a conservator in a fidu-
2 ciary capacity, an obligation arising from control of property included in
3 the conservatorship estate, or a tort committed in the course of administra-
4 tion of the conservatorship estate may be asserted against the conservator-
5 ship estate in a proceeding against the conservator in a fiduciary capacity,
6 whether or not the conservator is personally liable for the claim.
7 (4) A question of liability between a conservatorship estate and the
8 conservator personally may be determined in a proceeding for accounting,
9 surcharge, or indemnification or another appropriate proceeding or action.
10 15-5-430. REMOVAL OF CONSERVATOR -- APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR. (1) The
11 court may remove a conservator for failure to perform the conservator's du-
12 ties or other good cause and appoint a successor conservator to assume the
13 duties of the conservator.
14 (2) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to remove a con-
15 servator and appoint a successor upon:
16 (a) Petition of the individual subject to conservatorship, the conser-
17 vator, or a person interested in the welfare of the individual subject
18 to conservatorship that contains allegations that, if true, would sup-
19 port a reasonable belief that removal of the conservator and appoint-
20 ment of a successor may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold
21 a hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts
22 was filed during the preceding six (6) months;
23 (b) Communication from the individual subject to conservatorship,
24 the conservator, or a person interested in the welfare of the individ-
25 ual subject to conservatorship that supports a reasonable belief that
26 removal of the conservator and appointment of a successor may be appro-
27 priate; or
28 (c) Determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best in-
29 terest of the individual subject to conservatorship.
30 (3) Notice of a petition under subsection (2)(a) of this section shall
31 be given to the individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator, and
32 any other person as the court determines.
33 (4) An individual subject to conservatorship who seeks to remove the
34 conservator and have a successor appointed has the right to choose an attor-
35 ney to represent the individual subject to conservatorship in this matter.
36 If the individual subject to conservatorship is not represented by an attor-
37 ney, the court shall appoint an attorney under the same conditions as in sec-
38 tion 15-5-406, Idaho Code. The court shall award reasonable attorney's fees
39 to the attorney as provided in section 15-5-119, Idaho Code.
40 (5) In selecting a successor conservator, the court shall follow the
41 priorities under section 15-5-410, Idaho Code.
42 (6) Not later than thirty (30) days after appointing a successor con-
43 servator, the successor conservator shall give notice of the appointment to
44 the individual subject to conservatorship and any person entitled to notice
45 under section 15-5-411(5), Idaho Code, or a subsequent order.
46 15-5-431. TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION OF CONSERVATORSHIP. (1) A con-
47 servatorship for a minor terminates on the earliest of:
48 (a) A court order terminating the conservatorship;
65
1 (b) The minor:
2 (i) Becoming an adult; or
3 (ii) If the minor consents, or the court finds by clear and con-
4 vincing evidence that substantial harm to the minor's interests is
5 otherwise likely, attaining twenty-one (21) years of age;
6 (c) Emancipation of the minor; or
7 (d) Death of the minor.
8 (2) A conservatorship for an adult individual subject to conservator-
9 ship terminates on order of the court or when the adult individual subject to
10 conservatorship dies.
11 (3) An individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator, or a
12 person interested in the welfare of the individual subject to conservator-
13 ship may petition for:
14 (a) Termination of the conservatorship on the grounds that a basis for
15 appointment under section 15-5-401, Idaho Code, does not exist or ter-
16 mination would be in the best interest of the individual subject to con-
17 servatorship or for other good cause; or
18 (b) Modification of the conservatorship on the grounds that the extent
19 of protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good
20 cause.
21 (4) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination or
22 modification of a conservatorship is appropriate upon:
23 (a) Petition under subsection (3) of this section that contains alle-
24 gations that, if true, would support a reasonable belief that termi-
25 nation or modification of the conservatorship may be appropriate, but
26 the court may decline to hold a hearing if a petition based on the same
27 or substantially similar facts was filed within the preceding six (6)
28 months;
29 (b) A communication from the individual subject to conservatorship,
30 the conservator, or a person interested in the welfare of the individ-
31 ual subject to conservatorship that supports a reasonable belief that
32 termination or modification of the conservatorship may be appropriate,
33 including because the functional needs of the individual subject to
34 conservatorship or supports or services available to the individual
35 subject to conservatorship have changed;
36 (c) A report from a guardian or conservator that indicates that termi-
37 nation or modification may be appropriate because the functional needs
38 or supports or services available to the individual subject to conser-
39 vatorship have changed or a protective arrangement instead of conserva-
40 torship or other less restrictive alternative is available; or
41 (d) A determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best in-

45 such other person as the court determines.

47 servatorship, the court shall order termination unless it is proven that a
48 basis for appointment of a conservator under section 15-5-401, Idaho Code,
49 exists.
66
1 (7) The court shall modify the powers granted to a conservator if the
2 powers are excessive or inadequate due to a change in the abilities or limi-
3 tations of the individual subject to conservatorship, supports given to the
4 individual subject to conservatorship, or other circumstances.
5 (8) Unless the court otherwise orders for good cause, before terminat-
6 ing a conservatorship, the court shall follow the same procedures to safe-
7 guard the rights of the individual subject to conservatorship that apply to a
8 petition for conservatorship.
9 (9) An individual subject to conservatorship who seeks to terminate or
10 modify the terms of the conservatorship has the right to choose an attorney

15 section 15-5-119, Idaho Code.
16 (10) Upon termination of a conservatorship other than by reason of the
17 death of the individual subject to conservatorship, property of the conser-

26 proceed expeditiously to distribute the conservatorship estate to the in-
27 dividual subject to conservatorship's estate or as otherwise ordered by the
28 court. The conservator may take reasonable measures necessary to preserve
29 the conservatorship estate until distribution can be made.
30 (12) The court shall issue a final order of discharge on the approval
31 by the court of the final report and satisfaction by the conservator of any
32 other condition the court imposed on the conservator's discharge.
33 15-5-432. TRANSFER FOR BENEFIT OF MINOR WITHOUT APPOINTMENT OF CON-
34 SERVATOR. (1) Unless a person required to transfer funds or other property
35 to a minor knows that a conservator for the minor has been appointed or a pro-

3 care, education, health, or welfare of the minor and may not derive a per-
4 sonal financial benefit from it, except for reimbursement for necessary ex-
5 penses. Funds not applied for such purposes shall be preserved for the fu-
6 ture support, care, education, health, or welfare of the minor and the bal-
7 ance, if any, transferred to the minor when the minor becomes an adult or oth-
8 erwise is emancipated.

23 or no priority; provided that the court shall not pass over a parent or par-
24 ents unless the court concludes that the parent or parents are incapable or
25 unwilling to act reasonably and in the best interest of the minor. Such pro-
26 posed compromise is not effective until it is approved by the district court
27 of the county where the minor resides or, if the minor is not a resident of
28 the state of Idaho, by the district court of the county where the claim arose,
29 upon verified petition, filed with the court.

45 be deducted before or after the calculation of any contingency fee, in-
46 cluding the amount to be used for:
47 (i) Attorney's fees and whether the attorney's fees are fixed or
48 contingent fees;
49 (ii) Medical expenses; or

1 (iii) Other expenses;
2 (g) Whether the petitioner believes the acceptance of this compromise
3 is in the best interest of the minor;

5 tance of the compromise will bar the minor from seeking further relief
6 from the third person offering the compromise;
7 (i) If the claim involves a personal injury suffered by the minor, a
8 summary of:
9 (i) The injury, prognosis, treatment, and progress of recovery of

18 mise is reasonable and in the best interest of the minor, the court may ap-
19 prove the compromise or set a hearing. If the minor's claim is ten thousand
20 dollars ($10,000) or more, the court shall set a hearing for approval of the
21 compromise.
22 (5) If the court finds the compromise is reasonable and in the best in-
23 terest of the minor, the court may approve such compromise and may direct
24 that money be paid:
25 (a) To the parents, guardian, trustee, conservator, legal representa-
26 tive, or the designated payee thereof in accordance with the provisions
27 of this chapter;
28 (b) Subject to the provisions of an appropriate protective order; or
29 (c) In accordance with the provisions of chapter 14, title 68, Idaho
30 Code.

35 nated as Part 5, Chapter 5, Title 15, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
36 PART 5

38 15-5-501. AUTHORITY FOR PROTECTIVE ARRANGEMENT. (1) Under this part,
39 a court:
40 (a) Upon receiving a petition for a guardianship for an adult may order
41 a protective arrangement instead of guardianship as a less restrictive
42 alternative to guardianship; and

44 may order a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship as a less
45 restrictive alternative to conservatorship.
46 (2) A person interested in an adult's welfare, including the adult or
47 a conservator for the adult, may petition under this part for a protective
48 arrangement instead of guardianship.

1 (3) The following persons may petition under this part for a protective
2 arrangement instead of conservatorship:

11 Code, for a guardianship or under section 15-5-501(2), Idaho Code, for a
12 protective arrangement instead of guardianship, the court may issue an order
13 under subsection (2) of this section for a protective arrangement instead of
14 guardianship if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
15 (a) The respondent lacks the ability to meet essential requirements for
16 physical health, safety, or self-care because the respondent is unable
17 to receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions,
18 even with appropriate supportive services, technological assistance,
19 or supported decision-making; and
20 (b) The respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a less restric-
21 tive alternative.
22 (2) If the court makes the findings under subsection (1) of this sec-
23 tion, the court, instead of appointing a guardian, may:
24 (a) Authorize or direct a transaction necessary to meet the respon-
25 dent's need for health, safety, or care, including:
26 (i) A particular medical treatment or refusal of a particular
27 medical treatment;
28 (ii) A move to a specified place of dwelling; or
29 (iii) Visitation or supervised visitation between the respondent
30 and another person;
31 (b) Restrict access to the respondent by a specified person whose ac-
32 cess places the respondent at serious risk of physical, psychological,
33 or financial harm; and
34 (c) Order other arrangements on a limited basis that are appropriate.
35 (3) In deciding whether to issue an order under this section, the court
36 shall consider the factors under sections 15-5-313 and 15-5-314, Idaho Code,
37 that a guardian shall consider when making a decision on behalf of an adult
38 subject to guardianship.

40 SHIP FOR ADULT OR MINOR. (1) After the hearing on a petition under section
41 15-5-402, Idaho Code, for conservatorship for an adult or under section
42 15-5-501(3), Idaho Code, for a protective arrangement instead of conserva-
43 torship for an adult, the court may issue an order under subsection (3) of
44 this section for a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship for the
45 adult if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
46 (a) The adult is unable to manage property or financial affairs be-
47 cause:
70
1 (i) The adult is limited in the ability to receive and evaluate
2 information or make or communicate decisions, even with appropri-
3 ate supportive services, technological assistance, or supported
4 decision-making; or

6 United States;

11 port, care, education, health, or welfare of the adult or an indi-
12 vidual entitled to the adult's support; and

14 tive alternative.
15 (2) After the hearing on a petition under section 15-5-402, Idaho Code,
16 for conservatorship for a minor or under section 15-5-501(3), Idaho Code,
17 for a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship for a minor, the
18 court may issue an order under subsection (3) of this section for a protec-
19 tive arrangement instead of conservatorship for the minor if the court finds
20 by a preponderance of the evidence that the arrangement is in the minor's
21 best interest, and:
22 (a) If the minor has a parent, the court gives weight to any recommenda-
23 tion of the parent whether an arrangement is in the minor's best inter-
24 est;
25 (b) Either:
26 (i) The minor owns money or property requiring management or pro-
27 tection that otherwise cannot be provided;
28 (ii) The minor has or may have financial affairs that may be put at
29 unreasonable risk or hindered because of the minor's age; or
30 (iii) The arrangement is necessary or desirable to obtain or pro-
31 vide funds or other property needed for the support, care, educa-
32 tion, health, or welfare of the minor; and
33 (c) The order under subsection (3) of this section is necessary or de-
34 sirable to obtain or provide money needed for the support, care, educa-
35 tion, health, or welfare of the minor.
36 (3) If the court makes the findings under subsection (1) or (2) of this
37 section, the court, instead of appointing a conservator, may:
38 (a) Authorize or direct a transaction necessary to protect the finan-
39 cial interest or property of the respondent, including:
40 (i) An action to establish eligibility for benefits;
41 (ii) Payment, delivery, deposit, or retention of funds or prop-
42 erty;
43 (iii) Sale, mortgage, lease, or other transfer of property;
44 (iv) Purchase of an annuity;
45 (v) Entry into a contractual relationship, including a contract
46 to provide for personal care, supportive services, education,
47 training, or employment;
48 (vi) Addition to or establishment of a trust;
71
1 (vii) Ratification or invalidation of a contract, trust, will, or
2 other transaction, including a transaction related to the prop-
3 erty or business affairs of the respondent; or
4 (viii) Settlement of a claim; or
5 (b) Restrict access to the respondent's property by a specified person
6 whose access to the property places the respondent at serious risk of
7 financial harm.
8 (4) After the hearing on a petition under section 15-5-501(1)(b) or
9 (3), Idaho Code, whether or not the court makes the findings under subsection
10 (1) or (2) of this section, the court may issue an order to restrict access to
11 the respondent or the respondent's property by a specified person that the
12 court finds by clear and convincing evidence:
13 (a) Through fraud, coercion, duress, or the use of deception and con-
14 trol caused or attempted to cause an action that would have resulted in
15 financial harm to the respondent or the respondent's property; and
16 (b) Poses a serious risk of substantial financial harm to the respon-
17 dent or the respondent's property.
18 (5) Before issuing an order under subsection (3) or (4) of this section,
19 the court shall consider the factors under section 15-5-418, Idaho Code,
20 that a conservator shall consider when making a decision on behalf of an in-
21 dividual subject to conservatorship.
22 (6) Before issuing an order under subsection (3) or (4) of this section
23 for a respondent who is a minor, the court shall also consider the best inter-
24 est of the minor, the preference of the parents of the minor, and the prefer-
25 ence of the minor, if the minor is twelve (12) years of age or older.
26 15-5-504. PETITION FOR PROTECTIVE ARRANGEMENT. A petition for a pro-

23 department of health and welfare to designate at least one (1) qualified
24 psychiatrist or licensed psychologist to examine and report upon the mental
25 condition of the defendant to assist counsel with defense or understand the
26 proceedings. The appointed examiner shall also evaluate whether the defen-
27 dant lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment. The costs

30 title 19, Idaho Code.

32 idays, of the appointment or designation, the examiner shall determine the
33 best location for the examination. If practical, the examination shall be
34 conducted locally on an outpatient basis.

28 reason to believe that the defendant's alleged incompetency may be the
29 result of a developmental disability and the matter has not already been
30 referred to an evaluation committee for review, the examiner shall immedi-
31 ately notify the court. The court shall then appoint an evaluation committee

83
1 issue shall be determined by the court. The court shall also determine,
2 based on the examiner's findings, whether the defendant lacks capacity to
3 make informed decisions about treatment. If neither the prosecuting attor-
4 ney nor counsel for the defendant contests the finding of the report filed
5 pursuant to section 18-211, Idaho Code, the court may make the determination
6 on the basis of such report. If the finding is contested, the court shall
7 hold a hearing on the issue. If the report is received in evidence upon such
8 hearing, the party who contests the finding thereof shall have the right to
9 summon and to cross-examine the psychiatrist or licensed psychologist who
10 submitted the report and to offer evidence upon the issue.
11 (2) If the court determines that the defendant lacks fitness to pro-
12 ceed, the proceeding against him shall be suspended, except as provided in
13 subsections (5) and (6) of this section, and the court shall commit him to
14 the custody of the director of the department of health and welfare, for a
15 period not exceeding ninety (90) days, for care and treatment at an appro-

25 transport the defendant to and from the facility and require an evaluation
26 of the defendant's mental condition at the time of admission to the facility
27 and a progress report on the defendant's mental condition. The progress
28 report shall include an opinion whether the defendant is fit to proceed, or
29 if not, whether there is a substantial probability the defendant will be fit
30 to proceed within the foreseeable future. If the report concludes that there
31 is a substantial probability that the defendant will be fit to proceed in
32 the foreseeable future, the court may order the continued commitment of the
33 defendant for an additional one hundred eighty (180) days. If at any time the
34 director of the facility to which the defendant is committed determines that
35 the defendant is fit to proceed, such determination shall be reported to the
36 court.
37 (3) If during a commitment under this section a defendant who has the
38 capacity to make informed decisions about treatment refuses any and all
39 treatment, or the only treatment available to restore competency for trial,
40 the court shall, within seven (7) days, excluding weekends and holidays,
41 of receiving notice of the defendant's refusal from the facility, conduct
42 a hearing on whether to order involuntary treatment or order such other
43 terms and conditions as may be determined appropriate. The burden shall be
44 on the state to demonstrate grounds for involuntary treatment including,
45 but not limited to: the prescribed treatment is essential to restore the
46 defendant's competency, the medical necessity and appropriateness of the
47 prescribed treatment, no less intrusive treatment alternative exists to
48 render the defendant competent for trial, and other relevant information.
49 If each of these findings is made by the court, treatment shall be ordered
50 consistent with the findings.

2 cause copies to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney and to counsel for
3 the defendant. Upon receipt of a report, the court shall determine, after a
4 hearing if a hearing is requested, the disposition of the defendant and the
5 proceedings against him. If the court determines that the defendant is fit
6 to proceed, the proceeding shall be resumed. If at the end of the initial
7 ninety (90) days the court determines that the defendant is unfit and there
8 is not a substantial probability the defendant will be fit to proceed within
9 the foreseeable future or if the defendant is not fit to proceed after the
10 expiration of the additional one hundred eighty (180) days, involuntary com-
11 mitment proceedings shall be instituted pursuant to either section 66-329 or
12 66-406, Idaho Code, in the court in which the criminal charge is pending.
13 (5) In its review of commitments pursuant to section 66-337, Idaho
14 Code, the department of health and welfare shall determine whether the de-
15 fendant is fit to proceed with trial. The department of health and welfare
16 shall review its commitments pursuant to chapter 4, title 66, Idaho Code,
17 and may recommend that the defendant is fit to proceed with trial. If the
18 district court which committed the defendant pursuant to section 66-406,
19 Idaho Code, agrees with the department's recommendation and finds the condi-
20 tions which justified the order pursuant to section 66-406, Idaho Code, do
21 not continue to exist, criminal proceedings may resume. If the defendant is
22 fit to proceed, the court in which the criminal charge is pending shall be
23 notified and the criminal proceedings may resume. If, however, the court is
24 of the view that so much time has elapsed, excluding any time spent free from
25 custody by reason of the escape of the defendant, since the commitment of
26 the defendant that it would be unjust to resume the criminal proceeding, the
27 court may dismiss the charge.
28 (6) If a defendant escapes from custody during his confinement, the di-
29 rector shall immediately notify the court from which committed, the pros-
30 ecuting attorney and the sheriff of the county from which committed. The
31 court shall forthwith issue an order authorizing any health officer, peace
32 officer, or the director of the institution from which the defendant escaped
33 to take the defendant into custody and immediately return him to his place of
34 confinement.

33 issuance of a license under section 18-3302K, Idaho Code. Licenses issued
34 to individuals between the ages of eighteen (18) and twenty-one (21) years
35 under this subsection shall be easily distinguishable from licenses issued
36 pursuant to subsection (7) of this section. A license issued pursuant to
37 this subsection after July 1, 2016, shall expire on the twenty-first birth-
38 day of the licensee. A licensee, upon attaining the age of twenty-one (21)
39 years, shall be allowed to renew the license under the procedure contained in

41 enhanced license pursuant to the provisions of section 18-3302K, Idaho Code.
42 (21) A person carrying a concealed weapon in violation of the provisions
43 of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
44 (22) The sheriff of the county where the license was issued or the sher-
45 iff of the county where the person resides shall have the power to revoke a
46 license subsequent to a hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter

48 (a) Fraud or intentional misrepresentation in the obtaining of a li-
49 cense;
91
1 (b) Misuse of a license, including lending or giving a license to an-
2 other person, duplicating a license or using a license with the intent
3 to unlawfully cause harm to a person or property;
4 (c) The doing of an act or existence of a condition that would have been
5 grounds for the denial of the license by the sheriff;
6 (d) The violation of any of the terms of this section; or
7 (e) The applicant is adjudicated guilty of or receives a withheld judg-
8 ment for a crime that would have disqualified him from initially receiv-
9 ing a license.
10 (23) A person twenty-one (21) years of age or older who presents a valid
11 license to carry concealed weapons is exempt from any requirement to undergo
12 a records check at the time of purchase or transfer of a firearm from a feder-
13 ally licensed firearms dealer. Provided however, a temporary emergency li-
14 cense issued pursuant to subsection (6) of this section shall not exempt the
15 holder of the license from any records check requirement.
16 (24) The attorney general must contact the appropriate officials in
17 other states for the purpose of establishing, to the extent possible, recog-
18 nition and reciprocity of the license to carry concealed weapons by other
19 states, whether by formal agreement or otherwise. The Idaho state police
20 must keep a copy and maintain a record of all such agreements and reciprocity
21 recognitions, which must be made available to the public.
22 (25) Nothing in subsection (3) or (4) of this section shall be construed
23 to limit the existing rights of a private property owner, private tenant,
24 private employer, or private business entity. The provisions of this sub-
25 section shall not apply to any property owned by the state of Idaho or its
26 political subdivisions that is normally and habitually open to the public.
27 Such limitation on the application of this subsection shall supersede Hern-
28 don v. City of Sandpoint, 531 P.3d 1125 (Idaho 2023).
29 (a) Such limitation on the application of this subsection shall apply
30 whether such property is leased, rented, licensed, loaned, permitted,
31 or occupied, whether for consideration or not.
32 (b) Any restriction on the carrying of concealed weapons pursuant to
33 this subsection may only be invoked for public property owned by the
34 state or its political subdivisions when the use of such property is for
35 a private event by invitation only, for a commercial event that charges
36 admission, or for any other event with restricted access whether admis-
37 sion is charged or not. For any such private event, commercial event,
38 or other event, it must appear to a reasonable person that the general
39 public does not have unrestricted access to the designated public prop-
40 erty, or any subset of such property, that is normally and habitually
41 open to the public.
42 (c) Nothing in this subsection relieves any political subdivision of
43 the state of Idaho of its duties to convey or manage public property in
44 accordance with Idaho law.
45 (d) Nothing in this subsection alters or amends the provisions of sec-
46 tion 18-3302C or 18-3309, Idaho Code.
47 (26) The provisions of this section are hereby declared to be severable
48 and if any provision of this section or the application of such provision to
49 any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason, such declara-
50 tion shall not affect the validity of remaining portions of this section.
92

38 15-5-104. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION. (1) The district court has
39 jurisdiction over a conservatorship or protective arrangement instead of
40 a conservatorship for a minor domiciled or having property in this state.
41 Except to the extent jurisdiction is precluded by the uniform child custody
42 jurisdiction and enforcement act, chapter 11, title 32, Idaho Code, or the
43 Idaho child protective act, chapter 16, title 16, Idaho Code, the district
44 court has jurisdiction over a guardianship for a minor domiciled or present
45 in this state. Where a minor is within the jurisdiction of a court under the
46 child protective act or where a guardianship proceeding arose in connec-
47 tion with a permanency plan for a minor who was the subject of a proceeding
48 under the child protective act, the court having jurisdiction over the pro-

5
1 ceeding under the child protective act shall have exclusive jurisdiction
2 and venue over any guardianship proceeding involving such minor unless, in
3 furtherance of the permanency plan, the court declines to exercise such ju-
4 risdiction and venue, notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection.
5 (a) In any action connected to a guardianship pursuant to this subsec-
6 tion, in addition to notice or service upon interested parties, as pro-
7 vided in section 15-5-203, Idaho Code, notice of the following shall
8 be served upon the department of health and welfare in the manner pre-
9 scribed in Idaho supreme court rules:
10 (i) Any petition for the appointment of a guardian of a minor;
11 (ii) Any pleading filed in connection with such guardianship;
12 (iii) Any proceeding of any nature in such guardianship; and
13 (iv) The time and place of any hearing in connection with such
14 guardianship.
15 (b) In any action occurring pursuant to the provisions of this subsec-
16 tion, the department of health and welfare shall have the right to ap-
17 pear and be heard at any hearing and shall have the right to intervene at
18 any stage of the action.
19 (c) A guardian appointed in an action occurring pursuant to this sub-
20 section may not consent to the adoption of the minor without providing
21 prior notice of the action of adoption to the department of health and
22 welfare.
23 (2) The district court has jurisdiction over a guardianship, conserva-
24 torship, or protective arrangement under this chapter for an adult as pro-
25 vided in the uniform adult guardianship and protective proceedings juris-
26 diction act, chapter 13, title 15, Idaho Code.
27 (3) After notice is given in a proceeding for a guardianship, conserva-
28 torship, or protective arrangement under this chapter and until termination
29 of the proceeding, the court in which the petition is filed has:
30 (a) Exclusive jurisdiction to determine the need for the guardianship,
31 conservatorship, or protective arrangement;
32 (b) Exclusive jurisdiction to determine how property of the respondent
33 shall be managed, expended, or distributed to or for the use of the re-
34 spondent, an individual who is dependent in fact on the respondent, or
35 other claimant;
36 (c) Nonexclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of a claim
37 against the respondent or property of the respondent or a question of
38 title concerning the property; and
39 (d) If a guardian or conservator is appointed, exclusive jurisdiction
40 over issues related to administration of the guardianship or conserva-
41 torship.
42 (4) A court that appoints a guardian or conservator or authorizes a pro-
43 tective arrangement under this chapter has exclusive and continuing juris-
44 diction over the proceeding until the court terminates the proceeding or the
45 appointment or protective arrangement expires by its terms.
46 15-5-105. TRANSFER OF PROCEEDING. (1) The provisions of this section
47 do not apply to a guardianship or conservatorship for an adult that is sub-
48 ject to the transfer provisions of part 3, chapter 13, title 15, Idaho Code,
49 the uniform adult guardianship and protective proceedings jurisdiction act.

6
1 (2) After appointment of a guardian or conservator, the court that made
2 the appointment may transfer the proceeding to a court in another county in
3 this state or another state if transfer is in the best interest of the indi-
4 vidual subject to the guardianship or conservatorship.
5 (3) If a proceeding for a guardianship or conservatorship is pending in
6 another state or a foreign country and a petition for guardianship or conser-
7 vatorship for the same individual is filed in a court in this state, the court
8 shall notify the court in the other state or foreign country and, after con-
9 sultation with that court, assume or decline jurisdiction, whichever is in
10 the best interest of the respondent.
11 (4) A guardian or conservator appointed in another state or country may
12 petition the court for appointment as a guardian or conservator in this state
13 for the same individual if jurisdiction in this state is or will be estab-
14 lished. The appointment may be made on proof of appointment in the other
15 state or foreign country and presentation of a certified copy of the part of
16 the court record in the other state or country specified by the court in this
17 state.
18 (5) Notice of hearing on a petition under subsection (4) of this sec-
19 tion, together with a copy of the petition, shall be given to the respondent,
20 if the respondent is at least twelve (12) years of age at the time of the hear-
21 ing and to the persons that would be entitled to notice if the procedures for
22 appointment of a guardian or conservator under this chapter were applicable.
23 The court shall make the appointment unless it determines the appointment
24 would not be in the best interest of the respondent.
25 (6) No later than fourteen (14) days after appointment under subsection
26 (5) of this section, the guardian or conservator shall give a copy of the or-
27 der of appointment to the individual subject to guardianship or conservator-
28 ship, if the individual is at least twelve (12) years of age, and to all per-
29 sons given notice of the hearing on the petition.
30 15-5-106. VENUE. (1) Venue for a guardianship proceeding for a minor
31 shall be in:
32 (a) The county in which the minor resides or is present at the time the
33 proceeding commences; or
34 (b) The county in which another proceeding concerning the custody or
35 parental rights of the minor is pending.
36 (2) Venue for a guardianship proceeding or protective arrangement in-
37 stead of guardianship for an adult shall be in:
38 (a) The county in which the respondent resides;
39 (b) If the respondent has been admitted to an institution by court or-
40 der, the county in which the court is located; or
41 (c) If the proceeding is for appointment of an emergency guardian for
42 the respondent, the county in which the respondent is present.
43 (3) Venue for a conservatorship proceeding or protective arrangement
44 instead of conservatorship shall be in:
45 (a) The county in which the respondent resides, whether or not a
46 guardian has been appointed in another county or other jurisdiction; or
47 (b) If the respondent does not reside in this state, in any county in
48 which property of the respondent is located.

7
1 (4) If proceedings under this chapter are brought in more than one (1)
2 county, the court of the county in which the first proceeding is brought has
3 the exclusive right to proceed unless the court determines venue is properly
4 in another court or the interest of justice otherwise requires transfer of

35 (1) It sets forth the age of the minor involved in the proceeding as
36 shown by the records of the veterans administration and the fact that ap-
37 pointment is a condition precedent to payment of any moneys; or
38 (2) It sets forth the fact that a purportedly incapacitated person in-
39 volved in the proceeding has been rated incompetent by the veterans adminis-
40 tration upon examination pursuant to the laws governing such administration
41 and that appointment of a guardian is a condition precedent to payment of any
42 moneys due such incapacitated person.
43 15-5-130. COPIES OF PUBLIC RECORDS TO BE FURNISHED. When a copy of any

47 records shall without charge provide the applicant for such benefits or any

6 PART 2
7 GUARDIANSHIP OF MINOR
8 15-5-201. BASIS FOR APPOINTMENT OF GUARDIAN FOR MINOR. (1) Testamen-
9 tary appointment of guardian of minor. A parent of a minor may appoint a
10 guardian of an unmarried minor by will, subject to the right of the minor to
11 object to the appointment. The termination of parental rights of a parent
12 as to the minor shall also terminate the right of that parent to appoint a
13 guardian for the minor. A testamentary appointment becomes effective upon
14 the filing of the guardian's acceptance in the court in which the will is
15 probated, if, at the decedent's death, no parent of the minor was alive who
16 had a right to appoint a guardian for the minor. This state recognizes a
17 testamentary appointment effected by the guardian's acceptance under a will
18 probated in another state that is the testator's domicile. Written notice
19 of acceptance of the appointment shall be given by the guardian to the mi-
20 nor and to the person having his custody, or if none, to the person having
21 his care, or if none, to his nearest adult relation immediately upon accep-
22 tance of appointment. The parent may appoint by will one (1) or more alter-
23 nate guardians, in order of priority. If a guardian appointed by will fails
24 to accept guardianship within thirty (30) days after the will is probated,
25 or files a notice of declination to accept appointment prior to the running
26 of the thirty (30) day period, or is deceased, or ceases to act after accep-
27 tance, then the alternate guardian next in priority becomes the appointed
28 guardian and may file a written notice of acceptance in the court in which the
29 will is probated.
30 (2) Objection by minor twelve (12) years of age or older. A minor
31 twelve (12) years of age or older may prevent an appointment of his testamen-
32 tary guardian from becoming effective, or may cause a previously accepted
33 appointment to terminate, by filing with the court in which the will is
34 probated a written objection to the appointment before it is accepted or
35 within thirty (30) days after notice of its acceptance. An objection may be
36 withdrawn. In the event of such objection, the alternate guardian next in
37 priority named in the will may accept appointment, and the minor shall have
38 the same right of objection. An objection does not preclude appointment by
39 the court in a proper proceeding by the testamentary nominee or any other
40 suitable person.
41 (3) Testamentary appointment of guardian for incapacitated person or
42 developmentally disabled person.
43 (a) The parent of an incapacitated person or developmentally disabled
44 person may by will appoint a guardian of the incapacitated person or de-
45 velopmentally disabled person. A testamentary appointment by a parent
46 becomes effective when, after having given seven (7) days' prior writ-
47 ten notice of his intention to do so to the incapacitated person or de-
48 velopmentally disabled person and to the person having his care or to

17
1 his nearest adult relative, the guardian files acceptance of appoint-
2 ment in the court in which the will is informally or formally probated,
3 if prior thereto both parents are dead or the surviving parent is ad-
4 judged incapacitated. If both parents are dead, an effective appoint-
5 ment by the parent who died later has priority unless it is terminated by
6 the denial of probate in formal proceedings.
7 (b) The spouse of a married incapacitated person or developmentally
8 disabled person may by will appoint a guardian of the incapacitated
9 person or developmentally disabled person. The appointment becomes
10 effective when, after having given seven (7) days' prior written notice
11 of his intention to do so to the incapacitated person or developmentally
12 disabled person and to the person having his care or to his nearest adult
13 relative, the guardian files acceptance of appointment in the court
14 in which the will is informally or formally probated. An effective
15 appointment by a spouse has priority over an appointment by a parent
16 unless it is terminated by the denial of probate in formal proceedings.
17 (c) This state shall recognize a testamentary appointment effected by
18 filing acceptance under a will probated at the testator's domicile in
19 another state.
20 (d) Upon the filing with the court in which the will was probated of
21 written objection to the appointment by the person for whom a tes-
22 tamentary appointment of guardian has been made, the appointment is
23 terminated. An objection does not prevent appointment by the court in
24 a proper proceeding of the testamentary nominee or any other suitable
25 person upon an adjudication of incapacity in proceedings under the suc-
26 ceeding sections of this part.
27 (e) If the appointment by will is for a developmentally disabled person
28 and there is an existing guardianship proceeding under chapter 4, ti-
29 tle 66, Idaho Code, or under this chapter, in which the decedent was the
30 sole guardian, the guardian appointed by will shall also give seven (7)
31 days' written notice of his intention to file an acceptance of appoint-
32 ment to any then-serving guardian ad litem for the developmentally dis-
33 abled person in such proceeding and to the department of health and wel-
34 fare for the region in which the proceeding was brought.
35 (4) Court appointment of guardian of minor and conditions for appoint-
36 ment.
37 (a) The court may appoint a guardian for an unmarried minor if all
38 parental rights of custody have been terminated by prior court order
39 or upon a finding that the child has been neglected, abused, or aban-
40 doned or that the child's parents are unable to provide a stable home
41 environment. As used in this subsection, "abandoned," "abused," and
42 "neglected" shall have the same meaning as provided in section 16-1602,
43 Idaho Code. Failure to maintain a normal parental relationship with the
44 child without just cause for a period of six (6) months shall constitute
45 prima facie evidence of abandonment. Except in those circumstances de-
46 scribed in subsections (2) and (3) of this section and where a temporary
47 guardianship has been created at the request of a parent on active duty
48 in or deployment with the United States armed forces, the court shall
49 consider the best interest of the child as the primary factor in the de-
50 termination whether to appoint, and whom to appoint as, a guardian for

18
1 such child. In determining the choice of a guardian for an unmarried
2 minor, the advanced age or disability of a potential guardian shall not,
3 in and of itself, be used as a criterion of the suitability of the poten-
4 tial guardian as long as the potential guardian is otherwise suitable.
5 A guardian appointed by will, as provided in subsection (1) of this
6 section, whose appointment has not been prevented or nullified, as pro-
7 vided in subsection (2) of this section, has priority over any guardian
8 who may be appointed by the court, but the court may proceed with an ap-
9 pointment nonetheless upon a finding that the testamentary guardian has
10 failed to accept the testamentary appointment within thirty (30) days
11 after notice of the guardianship proceeding.
12 (b) The extended absence of a parent due to active duty in or deployment
13 with the United States armed forces shall not by itself constitute ne-
14 glect, abuse, abandonment, or failure to provide a stable home environ-
15 ment.
16 (c) Any guardianship granted at the request of or required by the United
17 States armed forces or at the request of a parent while on active duty
18 in or deployment with the United States armed forces, which duty or de-
19 ployment does not constitute neglect, abuse, abandonment, or failure
20 to provide a stable home environment, shall be terminated immediately
21 upon the conclusion of the original circumstances necessitating the
22 creation of the temporary guardianship or the filing of a termination
23 report by the parent indicating the parent's intent to resume all care,
24 custody, and control of the minor.
25 15-5-202. PETITION FOR APPOINTMENT OF GUARDIAN FOR MINOR. (1) A person
26 interested in the welfare of a minor, including the minor, may petition for
27 appointment of a guardian for the minor.

30 dress, phone number, relationship to the minor, interest in the appointment,

19

20
1 (4) If a petitioner is unable to serve notice under subsection (1)(a)
2 of this section on a parent of a minor or alleges that the parent waived, in
3 a record, the right to notice under this section, the court shall appoint a

7 whether the parent cannot be located with due diligence; and
8 (c) Investigate any other matter relating to the petition as the court

12 tion 15-5-202, Idaho Code, if:

39 ing, that:
40 (a) The minor consistently and repeatedly refused to attend the hearing

11 15-5-206. ORDER OF APPOINTMENT -- PRIORITY OF NOMINEE -- LIMITED
12 GUARDIANSHIP FOR MINOR. (1) After a hearing under section 15-5-203, Idaho
13 Code, the court may appoint a guardian for a minor, if appointment is proper
14 under section 15-5-201, Idaho Code, dismiss the proceeding, or take other
15 appropriate action consistent with this chapter or law of this state other
16 than this chapter.
17 (2) In appointing a guardian under subsection (1) of this section, the
18 following rules apply:
19 (a) The court shall appoint a person nominated as guardian by a par-
20 ent of the minor in a will or other record as provided in section 15-5-
21 201(1), Idaho Code, unless the court finds the appointment is contrary
22 to the best interest of the minor.
23 (b) If multiple parents have nominated different persons to serve as
24 guardian, the court shall appoint the nominee whose appointment is in
25 the best interest of the minor, unless the court finds that appointment
26 of none of the nominees is in the best interest of the minor.
27 (c) If a guardian is not appointed under paragraph (a) or (b) of this
28 subsection, the court shall appoint the person nominated by the minor
29 if the minor is twelve (12) years of age or older unless the court finds
30 that appointment is contrary to the best interest of the minor. In that
31 case, the court shall appoint as guardian a person whose appointment is
32 in the best interest of the minor.
33 (3) In the interest of maintaining or encouraging involvement by a mi-
34 nor's parent in the minor's life, developing self-reliance of the minor, or
35 for other good cause, the court, at the time of appointment of a guardian
36 for the minor or later, on its own or on motion of the minor or other inter-
37 ested person, may create a limited guardianship by limiting the powers oth-
38 erwise granted by this part to the guardian. Following the same procedure,
39 the court may grant additional powers or withdraw powers previously granted.
40 (4) The court, as part of an order appointing a guardian for a minor,
41 shall state rights retained by any parent of the minor that may include con-
42 tact or visitation with the minor, decision-making regarding the minor's
43 health care, education, or other matter, or access to a record regarding the
44 minor.
45 (5) An order granting a guardianship for a minor shall state that each
46 parent of the minor is entitled to notice that:
47 (a) The guardian has delegated custody of the minor subject to
48 guardianship;
49 (b) The court has modified or limited the powers of the guardian; or

22
1 (c) The court has removed the guardian.
2 (6) An order granting a guardianship for a minor shall identify any
3 person in addition to a parent of the minor who is entitled to notice of the
4 events listed in subsection (5) of this section.
5 15-5-207. DE FACTO CUSTODIAN. If a court determines by clear and con-
6 vincing evidence that a person meets the definition of a de facto custodian
7 and that recognition of the de facto custodian is in the best interest of the
8 child, the court shall give the person the same standing that is given to each
9 parent in proceedings for appointment of a guardian of a minor. In determin-
10 ing whether recognition of a de facto custodian is in the child's best inter-
11 est, the court shall consider:
12 (1) Whether the child is currently residing with the person seeking
13 such standing; and
14 (2) If the child is not currently residing with the person seeking such
15 standing, the length of time since the person served as the child's primary
16 caregiver and primary financial supporter.
17 15-5-208. EMERGENCY GUARDIAN FOR MINOR. (1) On its own, or on petition
18 by a person interested in a minor's welfare, the court may appoint an emer-
19 gency guardian for the minor if the court finds:
20 (a) Appointment of an emergency guardian is likely to prevent substan-
21 tial harm to the minor's health, safety, or welfare; and
22 (b) No other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in
23 the circumstances.
24 (2) The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for a minor may
25 not exceed ninety (90) days, and the emergency guardian may exercise only the
26 powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency guardian's au-
27 thority may be extended once for not more than ninety (90) days if the court
28 finds that the conditions for appointment of an emergency guardian in sub-
29 section (1) of this section continue.
30 (3) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section,
31 reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of a hearing on a petition for
32 appointment of an emergency guardian for a minor shall be given to:
33 (a) The minor, if the minor is twelve (12) years of age or older;
34 (b) Any attorney appointed under section 15-5-204, Idaho Code;
35 (c) Each parent of the minor;
36 (d) Any person, other than a parent, having care or custody of the mi-
37 nor; and
38 (e) Any other person as the court determines.
39 (4) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for a minor without no-
40 tice under subsection (3) of this section and without a hearing only if the
41 court finds from an affidavit or testimony that the minor's health, safety,
42 or welfare will be substantially harmed before a hearing with notice on the
43 appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emergency guardian with-
44 out notice to an unrepresented minor or the attorney for a represented mi-
45 nor, notice of the appointment shall be given not later than forty-eight (48)
46 hours after the appointment to the individuals listed in subsection (3) of
47 this section. Not later than seven (7) days after the appointment, the court
48 shall hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment.

23
1 (5) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section, with or
2 without notice, is not a determination that a basis exists for appointment of
3 a guardian under section 15-5-201, Idaho Code.
4 (6) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under this
5 section at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report the court
6 requires.
7 15-5-209. DUTIES OF GUARDIAN FOR MINOR. (1) A guardian for a minor is a
8 fiduciary. Except as otherwise limited by the court, a guardian for a minor
9 has the duties and responsibilities of a parent regarding the minor's sup-

23 for the minor's current needs for support, care, education, health,
24 safety, and welfare;
25 (e) Conserve any funds of the minor not expended under paragraph (d) of
26 this subsection for the minor's future needs, but if a conservator is
27 appointed for the minor, pay the funds at least quarterly to the conser-
28 vator to be conserved for the minor's future needs;
29 (f) Report the condition of the minor and account for funds and other
30 property of the minor in the guardian's possession or subject to the
31 guardian's control, as required by court rule or ordered by the court on
32 application of a person interested in the minor's welfare;
33 (g) Inform the court of any change in the minor's dwelling or address;
34 and
35 (h) In determining what is in the minor's best interest, take into ac-
36 count the minor's preferences, to the extent actually known or reason-
37 ably ascertainable by the guardian.
38 15-5-210. POWERS OF GUARDIAN FOR MINOR. (1) Except as otherwise lim-
39 ited by court order, a guardian of a minor has the powers a parent otherwise
40 would have regarding the minor's support, care, education, health, safety,
41 visitation, and welfare.
42 (2) Except as otherwise limited by court order, a guardian for a minor
43 may:
44 (a) Apply for and receive funds and benefits otherwise payable for the
45 support of the minor to the minor's parent, guardian, or custodian under
46 a statutory system of benefits or insurance or any private contract, de-
47 vise, trust, conservatorship, or custodianship;

24
1 (b) Unless inconsistent with a court order entitled to recognition in
2 this state, take custody of the minor and establish the minor's place of
3 dwelling and, on authorization of the court, establish or move the mi-
4 nor's dwelling outside this state;
5 (c) If the minor is not subject to conservatorship, commence a proceed-
6 ing, including an administrative proceeding, or take other appropriate
7 action to compel a person to support the minor or make a payment for the
8 benefit of the minor;
9 (d) Consent to health or other care, treatment, or service for the mi-
10 nor; or
11 (e) To the extent reasonable, delegate to the minor responsibility for
12 a decision affecting the minor's well-being.
13 (3) The court may authorize a guardian for a minor to consent to the
14 adoption of the minor if the minor does not have a parent.
15 (4) A guardian for a minor may consent to the marriage of the minor if
16 authorized by the court.
17 15-5-211. REMOVAL OF GUARDIAN FOR MINOR -- TERMINATION OF GUARDIAN-
18 SHIP -- APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR. (1) Guardianship under this chapter for a
19 minor terminates:
20 (a) Upon the minor's death, adoption, emancipation, or attainment of
21 majority; or
22 (b) When the court finds that the standard in section 15-5-201, Idaho
23 Code, for appointment of a guardian is not satisfied, unless the court
24 finds that:
25 (i) Termination of the guardianship would be harmful to the mi-
26 nor; and
27 (ii) The minor's interest in the continuation of the guardianship
28 outweighs the interest of any parent of the minor in restoration of
29 the parent's right to make decisions for the minor.
30 (2) A minor subject to guardianship or a person interested in the wel-
31 fare of the minor may petition the court to terminate the guardianship, mod-
32 ify the guardianship, remove the guardian, and appoint a successor guardian.
33 (3) A petitioner under subsection (2) of this section shall give notice
34 of the hearing on the petition to the minor, if the minor is twelve (12) years
35 of age or older and is not the petitioner, to the guardian, to each parent of
36 the minor, and to any other person as the court determines.
37 (4) Not later than thirty (30) days after appointment of a successor
38 guardian for a minor, the successor guardian shall give notice of the ap-
39 pointment to the minor subject to guardianship, if the minor is twelve (12)
40 years of age or older, each parent of the minor, and any other person as the
41 court determines.
42 (5) When terminating a guardianship for a minor under this section, the
43 court may issue an order providing for transitional arrangements that will
44 assist the minor with a transition of custody and is in the best interest of
45 the minor.
46 (6) A guardian for a minor that is removed shall cooperate with a suc-
47 cessor guardian to facilitate transition of the guardian's responsibilities
48 and protect the best interest of the minor.

25
1 SECTION 5. That Chapter 5, Title 15, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
2 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW PART, to be known and desig-
3 nated as Part 3, Chapter 5, Title 15, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
4 PART 3
5 GUARDIANSHIP OF ADULT
6 15-5-301. BASIS FOR APPOINTMENT OF GUARDIAN FOR ADULT. (1) Upon peti-
7 tion and after notice and hearing, the court may:
8 (a) Appoint a guardian for an adult if the court finds by clear and con-
9 vincing evidence that:
10 (i) The respondent lacks the ability to meet essential re-
11 quirements for physical health, safety, or self-care because the
12 respondent is unable to receive and evaluate information or make
13 or communicate decisions, even with appropriate supportive ser-
14 vices, technological assistance, or supported decision-making;
15 and
16 (ii) The respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a protec-
17 tive arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restric-
18 tive alternative; or
19 (b) With appropriate findings, treat the petition as one for a conser-
20 vatorship under part 4 of this chapter or a protective arrangement under
21 part 5 of this chapter, issue any appropriate order, or dismiss the pro-
22 ceeding.
23 (2) The court shall grant a guardian appointed under subsection (1) of
24 this section only those powers necessitated by the demonstrated needs and
25 limitations of the respondent and issue orders that will encourage develop-
26 ment of the respondent's maximum self-determination and independence. The
27 court may not establish a full guardianship if a limited guardianship, pro-
28 tective arrangement instead of guardianship, or other less restrictive al-
29 ternatives would meet the needs of the respondent.

30
1 lihood the person will be able to perform the duties of a guardian success-
2 fully.

17 which the respondent is receiving care may not be appointed as guardian un-
18 less the owner, operator, or employee is related to the respondent by blood,

24 (b) A person whose residence is the respondent's proposed residence or

26 felon.
27 15-5-310. ORDER OF APPOINTMENT FOR GUARDIAN. (1) A court order ap-
28 pointing a guardian for an adult shall:
29 (a) Include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence es-
30 tablished that the identified needs of the respondent cannot be met by a
31 protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restric-
32 tive alternative, including use of appropriate supportive services,
33 technological assistance, or supported decision-making;
34 (b) Include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence es-
35 tablished the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on the

42 the order includes findings that support removing that right by clear and
43 convincing evidence required by subsection (1)(c) of this section.
44 (3) A court order establishing a full guardianship for an adult subject
45 to guardianship shall state the basis for granting a full guardianship and
46 include specific findings by clear and convincing evidence that support the
47 conclusion that a limited guardianship would not meet the functional needs
48 of the adult subject to guardianship.

31
1 (4) A court order establishing a limited guardianship for an adult
2 subject to guardianship shall state the specific powers granted to the
3 guardian.
4 (5) The court, as part of an order establishing a guardianship for an

38 to guardianship, to the guardian, and to any other person entitled to notice
39 under section 15-5-310(5), Idaho Code, or under a subsequent order, a state-
40 ment of the rights of the adult subject to guardianship and the procedures to
41 seek relief if the adult is denied those rights. The statement shall be com-
42 municated in the manner set forth in section 15-5-113(3), Idaho Code. The

6 (d) Be notified at least fourteen (14) days before a change in the
7 adult subject to guardianship's primary dwelling or permanent move to
8 a nursing home, mental health facility, or other facility that places
9 restrictions on the adult subject to guardianship's ability to leave or
10 have visitors unless the change or move is proposed in the guardian's
11 plan under section 15-5-316, Idaho Code, or authorized by the court by
12 specific order;
13 (e) Object to a change or move described in paragraph (d) of this sub-
14 section and the process for objecting;

19 der to restrict communications, visits, or interactions;
20 (ii) A protective order or protective arrangement instead of
21 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult
22 subject to guardianship and a person; or
23 (iii) The guardian has good cause to believe restriction is nec-
24 essary because interaction with a specified person poses a risk
25 of significant physical, psychological, or financial harm to the
26 adult subject to guardianship, and the restriction is:
27 1. For a period of not more than seven (7) business days if
28 the person has a family or preexisting social relationship

36 15-5-312. EMERGENCY GUARDIAN FOR ADULT. (1) On its own, after a peti-
37 tion has been filed under section 15-5-302, Idaho Code, or upon petition by a
38 person interested in an adult respondent's welfare, the court may appoint an
39 emergency guardian for the respondent if the court finds:
40 (a) Appointment of an emergency guardian is likely to prevent substan-
41 tial harm to the respondent's physical health, safety, or welfare;
42 (b) No other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in
43 the circumstances; and
44 (c) There is reason to believe that a basis for appointment of a
45 guardian under section 15-5-301, Idaho Code, exists.
46 (2) The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for an adult may
47 not exceed ninety (90) days, and the emergency guardian may exercise only the
48 powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency guardian's au-
49 thority may be extended once for not more than ninety (90) days if the court

33
1 finds that the conditions for appointment of an emergency guardian in sub-
2 section (1) of this section continue.
3 (3) Immediately upon filing of a petition for appointment of an emer-
4 gency guardian for an adult, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent
5 the respondent in the proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in subsec-
6 tion (4) of this section, reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of
7 a hearing on the petition shall be given to the respondent, the respondent's
8 attorney, and any other person as the court determines.
9 (4) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for an adult respondent
10 without notice to the respondent and any attorney for the respondent only if
11 the court finds from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's physi-
12 cal health, safety, or welfare will be substantially harmed before a hearing
13 with notice on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emer-
14 gency guardian without giving notice under subsection (3) of this section,
15 the court shall:
16 (a) Give notice of the appointment not later than forty-eight (48)
17 hours after the appointment to:
18 (i) The respondent;
19 (ii) The respondent's attorney; and
20 (iii) Any other person as the court determines; and
21 (b) Hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment not later
22 than seven (7) days after the appointment.
23 (5) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section is not a de-
24 termination that a basis exists for appointment of a guardian under section
25 15-5-301, Idaho Code.
26 (6) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under this
27 section at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report the court
28 requires.
29 15-5-313. DUTIES OF GUARDIAN FOR ADULT. (1) A guardian for an adult is
30 a fiduciary. Except as otherwise limited by the court, a guardian for an
31 adult shall make decisions regarding the support, care, education, health,
32 and welfare of the adult subject to guardianship to the extent necessitated
33 by the adult subject to guardianship's limitations.
34 (2) A guardian for an adult subject to guardianship shall promote the
35 self-determination of the adult subject to guardianship and, to the extent
36 reasonably feasible, encourage the adult subject to guardianship to partic-
37 ipate in decisions, act on the adult subject to guardianship's own behalf,
38 and develop or regain the capacity to manage the adult subject to guardian-
39 ship's personal affairs. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:
40 (a) Become or remain personally acquainted with the adult subject to
41 guardianship and maintain sufficient contact with the adult subject to
42 guardianship, including through regular visitation, to know the adult
43 subject to guardianship's abilities, limitations, needs, opportuni-
44 ties, and physical and mental health;
45 (b) To the extent reasonably feasible, identify the values and prefer-
46 ences of the adult subject to guardianship and involve the adult subject
47 to guardianship in decisions affecting the adult subject to guardian-
48 ship, including decisions about the adult subject to guardianship's
49 care, dwelling, activities, or social interactions; and

34
1 (c) Make reasonable efforts to identify and facilitate supportive re-
2 lationships and services for the adult subject to guardianship.
3 (3) A guardian for an adult subject to guardianship at all times shall
4 exercise reasonable care, diligence, and prudence when acting on behalf of
5 or making decisions for the adult subject to guardianship. In furtherance of
6 this duty, the guardian shall:
7 (a) Take reasonable care of the personal effects, pets, and service
8 or support animals of the adult subject to guardianship and bring a
9 proceeding for a conservatorship or protective arrangement instead of
10 conservatorship if necessary to protect the adult subject to guardian-
11 ship's property;
12 (b) Expend funds and other property of the adult subject to guardian-
13 ship received by the guardian for the adult subject to guardianship's
14 current needs for support, care, education, health, and welfare;
15 (c) Conserve any funds and other property of the adult subject to
16 guardianship not expended under paragraph (b) of this subsection for
17 the adult subject to guardianship's future needs, but if a conservator
18 has been appointed for the adult subject to guardianship, pay the funds
19 and other property at least quarterly to the conservator to be conserved
20 for the adult subject to guardianship's future needs; and
21 (d) Monitor the quality of services, including long-term care ser-
22 vices, provided to the adult subject to guardianship.
23 (4) In making a decision for an adult subject to guardianship, the
24 guardian shall make the decision the guardian reasonably believes the adult
25 subject to guardianship would make if the adult subject to guardianship
26 were able unless doing so would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or
27 personal or financial interests of the adult subject to guardianship. To
28 determine the decision the adult subject to guardianship would make if able,
29 the guardian shall consider the adult subject to guardianship's previous
30 or current directions, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to the
31 extent actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.
32 (5) If a guardian for an adult subject to guardianship cannot make a
33 decision under subsection (4) of this section because the guardian does
34 not know and cannot reasonably determine the decision the adult subject
35 to guardianship probably would make if able, or the guardian reasonably
36 believes the decision the adult subject to guardianship would make would
37 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests
38 of the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian shall act in accordance
39 with the best interest of the adult subject to guardianship. In determining
40 the best interest of the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian shall
41 consider:
42 (a) Information received from professionals and persons that demon-
43 strate sufficient interest in the welfare of the adult subject to
44 guardianship;
45 (b) Other information the guardian believes the adult subject to
46 guardianship would have considered if the adult subject to guardianship
47 were able to act; and
48 (c) Other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the adult
49 subject to guardianship would consider, including consequences for
50 others.

35
1 (6) A guardian for an adult subject to guardianship shall immediately
2 notify the court if the condition of the adult subject to guardianship has
3 changed so that the adult subject to guardianship is capable of exercising
4 rights previously removed.
5 15-5-314. POWERS OF GUARDIAN FOR ADULT. (1) Except as limited by court
6 order, a guardian for an adult subject to guardianship may:
7 (a) Apply for and receive funds and benefits for the support of the
8 adult subject to guardianship, unless a conservator is appointed for
9 the adult subject to guardianship and the application or receipt is
10 within the powers of the conservator;
11 (b) Unless inconsistent with a court order, establish the adult subject
12 to guardianship's place of dwelling;
13 (c) Consent to health care or other care, treatment, or service for the
14 adult subject to guardianship;
15 (d) If a conservator for the adult subject to guardianship has not been
16 appointed, commence a proceeding, including an administrative proceed-
17 ing, or take other appropriate action to compel another person to sup-
18 port the adult subject to guardianship or pay funds for the adult sub-
19 ject to guardianship's benefit;
20 (e) To the extent reasonable, delegate to the adult subject to
21 guardianship responsibility for a decision affecting the adult subject
22 to guardianship's well-being; and
23 (f) Receive personally identifiable health care information regarding
24 the adult subject to guardianship.
25 (2) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult
26 subject to guardianship to consent to the adoption of the adult subject to
27 guardianship.
28 (3) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult
29 subject to guardianship to:
30 (a) Consent or withhold consent to the marriage of the adult subject to
31 guardianship if the adult subject to guardianship's right to marry has
32 been removed under section 15-5-310, Idaho Code;
33 (b) Petition for divorce, dissolution, or annulment of marriage of
34 the adult subject to guardianship or a declaration of invalidity of the

36 (c) Support or oppose a petition for divorce, dissolution, or annulment
37 of marriage of the adult subject to guardianship or a declaration of in-
38 validity of the adult subject to guardianship's marriage.
39 (4) In determining whether to authorize a power under subsection (2)
40 or (3) of this section, the court shall consider whether the underlying act
41 would be in accordance with the adult subject to guardianship's preferences,
42 values, and prior directions and whether the underlying act would be in the
43 adult subject to guardianship's best interest.
44 (5) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (1)(b) of this
45 section to establish the adult subject to guardianship's place of dwelling,
46 the guardian shall:
47 (a) Select a residential setting the guardian believes the adult sub-
48 ject to guardianship would select if the adult subject to guardianship
49 were able, in accordance with the decision-making standard in section

36
1 15-5-313(4) and (5), Idaho Code. If the guardian does not know and can-
2 not reasonably determine what setting the adult subject to guardianship
3 probably would choose if able, or the guardian reasonably believes the
4 decision the adult subject to guardianship would make would unreason-
5 ably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of
6 the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian shall choose in accor-
7 dance with section 15-5-313(5), Idaho Code, a residential setting that
8 is consistent with the adult subject to guardianship's best interest;
9 (b) In selecting among residential settings, give priority to a res-
10 idential setting in a location that will allow the adult subject to
11 guardianship to interact with persons important to the adult subject to
12 guardianship and meet the adult subject to guardianship's needs in the
13 least restrictive manner reasonably feasible unless to do so would be
14 inconsistent with the decision-making standard in section 15-5-313(4)
15 and (5), Idaho Code;
16 (c) No later than fourteen (14) days after a change in the dwelling of
17 the adult subject to guardianship:
18 (i) Give notice of the change to the court, the adult subject to
19 guardianship, and any person identified as entitled to the notice
20 in the court order appointing the guardian or a subsequent order;
21 and
22 (ii) Include in the notice the address and nature of the new
23 dwelling and state whether the adult subject to guardianship re-
24 ceived advance notice of the change and whether the adult subject
25 to guardianship objected to the change;
26 (d) Establish or move the permanent place of dwelling of the adult sub-
27 ject to guardianship to a nursing home, mental health facility, or other
28 facility that places restrictions on the adult subject to guardian-
29 ship's ability to leave or have visitors only if:
30 (i) The establishment or move is in the guardian's plan under sec-
31 tion 15-5-316, Idaho Code;
32 (ii) The court authorizes the establishment or move; or
33 (iii) The guardian gives notice of the establishment or move at
34 least fourteen (14) days before the establishment or move to the
35 adult subject to guardianship and all persons entitled to notice
36 under section 15-5-310(5)(b), Idaho Code, or a subsequent order,
37 and no objection is filed;
38 (e) Establish or move the place of dwelling of the adult subject to
39 guardianship outside this state only if consistent with the guardian's
40 plan and authorized by the court by specific order; and
41 (f) Take action that would result in the sale of or surrender of the
42 lease to the primary dwelling of the adult subject to guardianship only
43 if:
44 (i) The action is specifically included in the guardian's plan
45 under section 15-5-316, Idaho Code;
46 (ii) The court authorizes the action by specific order; or
47 (iii) Notice of the action was given at least fourteen (14) days
48 before the action to the adult subject to guardianship and all per-
49 sons entitled to the notice under section 15-5-310(5)(b), Idaho
50 Code, or a subsequent order and no objection has been filed.

37
1 (6) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (1)(c) of this
2 section to make health care decisions, the guardian shall:
3 (a) Involve the adult subject to guardianship in decision-making to the
4 extent reasonably feasible, including, when practicable, by encourag-
5 ing and supporting the adult subject to guardianship in understanding
6 the risks and benefits of health care options;
7 (b) Defer to a decision by an agent under a medical directive executed
8 by the adult subject to guardianship and cooperate to the extent feasi-
9 ble with the agent making the decision; and
10 (c) Take into account:
11 (i) The risks and benefits of treatment options; and
12 (ii) The current and previous wishes and values of the adult sub-
13 ject to guardianship, if known or reasonably ascertainable by the
14 guardian.
15 15-5-315. SPECIAL LIMITATIONS ON GUARDIAN'S POWER. (1) Unless au-
16 thorized by the court by specific order, a guardian for an adult subject to
17 guardianship does not have the power to revoke or amend a medical directive
18 or power of attorney for finances executed by the adult subject to guardian-
19 ship. If a medical directive is in effect, unless there is a court order to
20 the contrary, a health care decision of an agent takes precedence over that
21 of the guardian and the guardian shall cooperate with the agent to the extent
22 feasible. If a power of attorney for finances is in effect, unless there
23 is a court order to the contrary, a decision by the agent that the agent is
24 authorized to make under the power of attorney for finances takes precedence
25 over that of the guardian and the guardian shall cooperate with the agent to
26 the extent feasible.
27 (2) A guardian for an adult subject to guardianship may not initiate the
28 commitment of the adult subject to guardianship to a mental health facility
29 except in accordance with the state's procedure for involuntary civil com-
30 mitment.
31 (3) A guardian for an adult subject to guardianship may not restrict
32 the ability of the adult subject to guardianship to communicate, visit, or
33 interact with others, including receiving visitors and making or receiving
34 telephone calls, personal mail, or electronic communications, including
35 through social media, or participating in social activities, unless:
36 (a) Authorized by the court by specific order;
37 (b) A protective order or a protective arrangement instead of guardian-
38 ship is in effect that limits contact between the adult subject to
39 guardianship and a person; or
40 (c) The guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
41 because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of signifi-
42 cant physical, psychological, or financial harm to the adult subject to
43 guardianship and the restriction is:
44 (i) For a period of not more than seven (7) business days if the
45 person has a family or preexisting social relationship with the
46 adult subject to guardianship; or
47 (ii) For a period of not more than sixty (60) days if the person
48 does not have a family or preexisting social relationship with the
49 adult subject to guardianship.

38
1 (4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section, a
2 guardian appointed for a person with a developmental disability shall have
3 no authority to refuse or withhold consent for medically necessary treatment
4 when the effect of withholding such treatment would seriously endanger the
5 life or health and well-being of the individual subject to guardianship.
6 To withhold or attempt to withhold consent for such treatment may be cause
7 for removal of the guardian. Except as otherwise provided in subsection
8 (8) of this section, no health care provider or caregiver shall, based on
9 such guardian's direction or refusal to consent to care, withhold or with-
10 draw such treatment for the individual subject to guardianship. If the
11 health care provider cannot obtain valid consent for such medically nec-
12 essary treatment from the guardian, the health care provider or caregiver
13 shall provide the medically necessary treatment as authorized by section
14 39-4504(1)(i), Idaho Code.
15 (5) A guardian appointed for a person with a developmental disability
16 may consent to withholding or withdrawing treatment other than appropri-
17 ate nutrition or hydration to the individual subject to guardianship, and
18 a health care provider may withhold or withdraw such treatment in reliance
19 on such consent, when in the reasonable medical judgment of the treating
20 licensed independent practitioner, as defined in section 39-4502(13), Idaho
21 Code, any of the following circumstances apply:
22 (a) The attending licensed independent practitioner and at least
23 one (1) other licensed independent practitioner certifies that the
24 individual subject to guardianship is chronically and irreversibly co-
25 matose;
26 (b) The treatment would merely prolong dying, would not be effective in
27 ameliorating or correcting all of the individual subject to guardian-
28 ship's life-threatening conditions, or would otherwise be futile in
29 terms of the survival of the individual subject to guardianship; or
30 (c) The treatment would be virtually futile in terms of the survival of
31 the individual subject to guardianship and would be inhumane under such
32 circumstances.
33 (6) Any person who has information that medically necessary treatment
34 of a individual subject to guardianship has been withheld or withdrawn in
35 violation of this section may report such information to adult protective
36 services or to the Idaho protection and advocacy system for people with de-
37 velopmental disabilities, which shall have the authority to investigate the
38 report and in appropriate cases to seek a court order to ensure that medi-
39 cally necessary treatment is provided. If adult protective services or the
40 protection and advocacy system determines that the withholding of medical
41 treatment violates the provisions of this section, it may petition the court
42 for an ex parte order to provide or continue the medical treatment in ques-
43 tion. If the court finds, based on affidavits or other evidence, that there
44 is probable cause to believe that the withholding of medical treatment in a
45 particular case violates the provisions of this section, and that the life or
46 health of the individual subject to guardianship is endangered thereby, the
47 court shall issue an ex parte order to continue or to provide the treatment
48 until such time as the court can hear evidence from the parties involved. Pe-
49 titions for court orders under this section shall be expedited by the courts

39
1 and heard as soon as possible. No bond shall be required of a petitioner un-
2 der this section.
3 (7) No partial or total guardian or partial or total conservator ap-
4 pointed under the provisions of this chapter may without specific approval
5 of the court in a proceeding separate from that in which such guardian or con-
6 servator was appointed:
7 (a) Consent to medical or surgical treatment, the effect of which per-
8 manently prohibits the conception of children by the individual subject
9 to guardianship unless the treatment or procedures are necessary to
10 protect the physical health of the individual subject to guardianship
11 and would be prescribed for a person who does not have a developmental
12 disability; or
13 (b) Consent to experimental surgery, procedures, or medications.
14 (8) Nothing in this section shall affect the rights of a competent per-
15 son or surrogate decision-maker to withhold or withdraw treatment pursuant
16 to section 39-4514, Idaho Code, unless the person is a respondent as defined
17 in this chapter.
18 15-5-316. GUARDIAN'S PLAN. A guardian's plan shall be done in accor-
19 dance with Idaho supreme court rules.
20 15-5-317. GUARDIAN'S REPORT -- MONITORING OF GUARDIANSHIP. A
21 guardian's report on care of the adult and monitoring of a guardianship shall
22 be done in accordance with Idaho supreme court rules.
23 15-5-318. REMOVAL OF GUARDIAN FOR ADULT -- APPOINTMENT OF SUCCES-
24 SOR. (1) The court may remove a guardian for an adult subject to guardianship
25 for failure to perform the guardian's duties or for other good cause and ap-
26 point a successor guardian to assume the duties of guardian.
27 (2) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to remove
28 a guardian for an adult subject to guardianship and appoint a successor
29 guardian upon:
30 (a) Petition of the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian, or a
31 person interested in the welfare of the adult subject to guardianship
32 that contains allegations that, if true, would support a reasonable
33 belief that removal of the guardian and appointment of a successor
34 guardian may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a hearing
35 if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was filed
36 during the preceding six (6) months;
37 (b) Communication from the adult subject to guardianship, the
38 guardian, or a person interested in the welfare of the adult subject
39 to guardianship that supports a reasonable belief that removal of the
40 guardian and appointment of a successor guardian may be appropriate; or
41 (c) Determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best in-
42 terest of the adult subject to guardianship.
43 (3) Notice of a petition under subsection (2)(a) of this section shall
44 be given to the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian, and any other
45 person as the court determines.
46 (4) An adult subject to guardianship who seeks to remove the guardian
47 and have a successor guardian appointed has the right to choose an attor-

40
1 ney to represent the adult subject to guardianship in this matter. If the
2 adult subject to guardianship is not represented by an attorney, the court
3 shall appoint an attorney under the same conditions as in section 15-5-305,
4 Idaho Code. The court shall award reasonable attorney's fees to the attorney
5 for the adult subject to guardianship as provided in section 15-5-119, Idaho
6 Code.
7 (5) In selecting a successor guardian for an adult subject to guardian-
8 ship, the court shall follow the priorities under section 15-5-309, Idaho
9 Code.
10 (6) No later than thirty (30) days after appointing a successor
11 guardian, the court shall give notice of the appointment to the adult subject
12 to guardianship and any person entitled to notice under section 15-5-310(5),
13 Idaho Code, or a subsequent order.
14 15-5-319. TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION OF GUARDIANSHIP FOR ADULT. (1)
15 An adult subject to guardianship, the guardian for the adult subject to
16 guardianship, or a person interested in the welfare of the adult subject to
17 guardianship may petition for:
18 (a) Termination of the guardianship on the grounds that a basis for
19 appointment under section 15-5-301, Idaho Code, does not exist or
20 that termination would be in the best interest of the adult subject to
21 guardianship or for other good cause; or
22 (b) Modification of the guardianship on the grounds that the extent of
23 protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good
24 cause.
25 (2) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination or
26 modification of a guardianship for an adult subject to guardianship is ap-
27 propriate upon:
28 (a) Petition under subsection (1) of this section that contains allega-
29 tions that, if true, would support a reasonable belief that termination
30 or modification of the guardianship may be appropriate, but the court
31 may decline to hold a hearing if a petition based on the same or substan-
32 tially similar facts was filed during the preceding six (6) months;
33 (b) Communication from the adult subject to guardianship, the
34 guardian, or a person interested in the welfare of the adult subject
35 to guardianship that supports a reasonable belief that termination or
36 modification of the guardianship may be appropriate, including because
37 the functional needs of the adult subject to guardianship or supports or
38 services available to the adult subject to guardianship have changed;
39 (c) A report from a guardian or conservator that indicates that ter-
40 mination or modification may be appropriate because the functional
41 needs of the adult subject to guardianship or supports or services
42 available to the adult subject to guardianship have changed or a pro-
43 tective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive
44 alternative for meeting the adult subject to guardianship's needs is
45 available; or
46 (d) A determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best in-
47 terest of the adult subject to guardianship.

41
1 (3) Notice of a petition under subsection (2)(a) of this section shall
2 be given to the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian, and any other
3 person as the court determines.
4 (4) Upon presentation of prima facie evidence for termination of a
5 guardianship for an adult subject to guardianship, the court shall order
6 termination unless it is proven that a basis for appointment of a guardian
7 under section 15-5-301, Idaho Code, exists.
8 (5) The court shall modify the powers granted to a guardian for an adult
9 subject to guardianship if the powers are excessive or inadequate due to a
10 change in the abilities or limitations of the adult subject to guardianship,
11 the adult subject to guardianship's supports, or other circumstances.
12 (6) Unless the court otherwise orders for good cause, before terminat-
13 ing or modifying a guardianship for an adult subject to guardianship, the
14 court shall follow the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the adult
15 subject to guardianship that apply to a petition for guardianship.
16 (7) An adult subject to guardianship who seeks to terminate or modify
17 the terms of the guardianship has the right to choose an attorney to repre-
18 sent the adult subject to guardianship in the matter. If the adult subject
19 to guardianship is not represented by an attorney, the court shall appoint an
20 attorney under the same conditions as in section 15-5-305, Idaho Code. The
21 court shall award reasonable attorney's fees to the attorney for the adult
22 subject to guardianship as provided in section 15-5-119, Idaho Code.
23 15-5-320. DESIGNATION OF BOARDS OF COMMUNITY GUARDIAN. After making
24 a determination that there exists a need within a county for a guardian for
25 those persons in need of guardianship and for whom there is no person or cor-
26 poration qualified and willing to act in such capacity, the board of county
27 commissioners may create and budget for, within the county, a board of commu-
28 nity guardian. The board of county commissioners of one (1) or more counties
29 within a judicial district may jointly create and budget for a board of com-
30 munity guardian within that district.
31 15-5-321. BOARD OF COMMUNITY GUARDIAN STRUCTURE -- POWERS AND DU-
32 TIES. (1) Any board of community guardian that is created within a county or
33 counties in a judicial district shall operate under the laws of the state of
34 Idaho, including the Idaho guardianship, conservatorship, and trust laws.
35 (2) A board of community guardian shall consist of no fewer than seven
36 (7) and no more than eleven (11) members who are representatives of commu-
37 nity interests involving persons needing guardians or conservators as de-
38 fined in this chapter. Members shall be appointed by the board of county com-
39 missioners that created the board of community guardian under section 15-5-
40 320, Idaho Code.
41 (3) The terms of the members of the board shall be for four (4) years and
42 shall be staggered. A number of members equaling or most closely exceeding
43 fifty percent (50%) shall initially be appointed for three (3) years. Any
44 vacancy created by resignation or expiration of term shall be filled in the
45 same manner as the original appointment.
46 (4) A member shall continue to serve on the board until that person's
47 successor is appointed.
48 (5) The board shall meet not less than once each quarter.

42
1 (6) No person shall be a member of a board who is also an employee of the
2 district court or the clerk of the district court in the judicial district
3 where the board is formed.
4 (7) A board member having previously provided or currently providing
5 services to a person under guardianship shall disclose such to the board and
6 abstain from any decision or action taken concerning that particular person
7 under guardianship.
8 (8) Board members and officers shall serve without pay.
9 (9) Each board shall elect its own chairman and other officers.
10 (10) A board, in those instances when a guardian or conservator is re-
11 quired and no qualified family member or other qualified person has volun-
12 teered to serve, may:
13 (a) Locate a qualified person to serve as guardian or conservator; or
14 (b) Petition the court to be appointed as guardian or conservator.
15 (11) The board shall have all the powers and duties where applicable by
16 court order and other provisions of this chapter and in addition shall:
17 (a) Locate and recommend to the court, where necessary, that a visitor
18 be appointed;
19 (b) Have access to all confidential records, including abuse reg-
20 istry reports that may be maintained by state or private agencies or
21 institutions, which records concern a person for whom the board acts as
22 guardian or conservator. The name of the person reporting the alleged
23 abuse shall be subject to disclosure according to the provisions of
24 chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code;
25 (c) Review and monitor the services provided by public and private
26 agencies to any individual subject to guardianship or conservatorship
27 for whom the board acts as guardian or conservator and determine the
28 continued need for those services;
29 (d) Assess a fee for services developed pursuant to this part; and
30 (e) Have the power, subject to the approval of the board of county com-
31 missioners, to adopt such rules as are necessary to carry out the duties
32 and responsibilities of the board.
33 (12) When a board serves as guardian or conservator, it shall be compen-
34 sated as other guardians or conservators pursuant to Idaho law. If, at the
35 time the board is appointed as guardian or conservator, the person for whom
36 the board is to act has no funds, the court may waive the payment of fees.
37 (13) When a board serves as guardian or conservator, there is created,
38 at the time of filing of the order of appointment, a lien in favor of the board
39 against any real property owned by the individual subject to guardianship or
40 conservatorship, enforceable only upon the termination of the guardianship
41 or conservatorship, for all fees that were incurred throughout the duration
42 of the services and that were not paid prior to termination. All fees in-
43 curred throughout the duration of the services and that were not paid prior
44 to the termination of services shall relate back to the effective date of the
45 lien. The board shall record a notice of said lien within thirty (30) days
46 of filing of the order of appointment. Such liens shall be recorded in every
47 county where property subject to the lien is located. The notice shall con-
48 tain at least the following information:
49 (a) Full court heading of the action in which the appointment was made;
50 (b) The effective date of the lien;

43
1 (c) The name and address of the board; and
2 (d) Any limitations or terms regarding the fees covered by the lien con-
3 tained in the order of appointment.
4 (14) The court may postpone or arrange for gradual repayment of the fees
5 if the court finds that the immediate repayment would create a hardship on
6 the individual subject to guardianship.
7 (15) No member of a board of community guardian, employee of the board,
8 or visitor appointed at the request of such board shall be liable for civil
9 damages by reason of authorizing medical treatment or surgery for the person
10 for whom the board is appointed, if the board member, employee, or visitor,
11 after medical consultation with the person's physician, acts in good faith,
12 is not negligent, and acts within the limits established for the guardian or
13 conservator by the court. No such person shall be liable, by reason of his
14 authorization, for injury to the person for whom the guardian or conservator
15 has been appointed, which injury results from the negligence or other acts
16 of a third person, if the court has authorized the giving of medical consent
17 by the board or the individual members of the board. No such person shall be
18 liable in the performance of acts done in good faith within the scope of his
19 authority as long as the act is not of a wanton or grossly negligent nature.
20 The board of community guardian shall be deemed to be a governmental entity
21 for the purposes of application of the Idaho tort claims act.
22 15-5-322. BOARD OF COMMUNITY GUARDIAN ANNUAL REPORT. (1) Each board of
23 community guardian shall report annually in writing to the board of county
24 commissioners, and in the case of a multicounty board, to each participating
25 county, its activities for the preceding year, which report shall contain:
26 (a) A fiscal report that adequately reflects the financial operation of
27 the board;
28 (b) The number of volunteer guardians obtained by the board;
29 (c) The number of persons for whom the board is acting as guardian;
30 (d) Recommendations for improving guardianship services in the dis-

33 community guardian or the board of county commissioners.
34 (2) The report shall be filed no later than April 1 of each year and
35 shall cover the preceding calendar year.
36 (3) The board of county commissioners shall review each report and
37 shall determine whether to dissolve or continue the board of community
38 guardian in the county. Where there is a multicounty board of community
39 guardian, the boards of county commissioners of all concerned counties shall
40 concur in a decision to dissolve the board of community guardian.
41 SECTION 6. That Chapter 5, Title 15, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
42 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW PART, to be known and desig-
43 nated as Part 4, Chapter 5, Title 15, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:

2 evidence that appointment of a conservator is in the minor's best interest,
3 and:

5 tion of the parent whether an appointment is in the minor's best inter-
6 est; and

14 health, or welfare of the minor.
15 (2) Upon petition and after notice and hearing, the court may appoint
16 a conservator for the property or financial affairs of a respondent if the
17 court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
18 (a) The respondent is unable to manage property or financial affairs
19 because:

24 (ii) The respondent is missing, detained, or unable to return to

33 rangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive alter-
34 native.
35 (3) The court shall grant a conservator only those powers necessitated
36 by demonstrated limitations and needs of the respondent and issue orders
37 that will encourage development of the respondent's maximum self-determina-
38 tion and independence. The court may not establish a full conservatorship
39 if a limited conservatorship, protective arrangement instead of conserva-
40 torship, or other less restrictive alternative would meet the needs of the

44 dent in the financial power of attorney for the respondent, or if no such
45 nomination is made therein, the individual or person nominated as agent
46 therein, provided that:
47 (i) If co-conservators or co-agents, as appropriate, are nomi-
48 nated, the court may consider whether appointment of co-conserva-

50
1 tors is in the best interest of the respondent or whether a sole
2 conservator should be appointed;
3 (ii) If several individuals or persons are nominated in order of
4 priority, the court shall consider such nominations in that order
5 of priority; and
6 (iii) If more than one (1) financial power of attorney made by
7 the respondent exists, the court shall determine which financial
8 power of attorney is appropriate to be the basis for nomination of
9 a conservator;
10 (c) The spouse of the respondent;
11 (d) An adult child of the respondent;
12 (e) A conservator, guardian of property, or other like fiduciary, but
13 not a fiduciary serving only as a trustee, appointed or recognized by
14 the appropriate court of any other jurisdiction in which the respondent
15 resides;

22 (2) A person in priority of subsection (1)(c) through (g) of this sec-
23 tion may nominate in writing a person to serve in his stead. With respect
24 to persons having equal priority, the court is to select the one who is best
25 qualified of those willing to serve. The court for good cause may pass over a
26 person having priority and appoint a person having less priority or no prior-
27 ity.

29 of a respondent unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that
30 such appointment is in the best interest of the respondent.

32 vidual who is employed by a person that provides paid services to the respon-
33 dent, or is the spouse, parent, or child of an individual who provides or is

39 the best qualified person available for appointment and the appointment

46 appointing a conservator for a minor shall include findings to support ap-

6 restrictive alternative, including use of appropriate supportive ser-
7 vices, technological assistance, or supported decision-making; and
8 (b) Include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence es-
9 tablished the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on the
10 petition.

18 powers granted to the conservator.

35 15-5-413. EMERGENCY CONSERVATOR. (1) On its own, or upon petition by a
36 person interested in a respondent's welfare after a petition has been filed
37 under section 15-5-402, Idaho Code, the court may appoint an emergency con-
38 servator for the respondent if the court finds:
39 (a) Appointment of an emergency conservator is likely to prevent sub-
40 stantial and irreparable harm to the respondent's property or financial
41 interests;
42 (b) No other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in
43 the circumstances; and
44 (c) There is reason to believe that a basis for appointment of a conser-
45 vator under section 15-5-401, Idaho Code, exists.
46 (2) The duration of authority of an emergency conservator may not ex-
47 ceed ninety (90) days, and the emergency conservator may exercise only the
48 powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency conservator's
49 authority may be extended once for not more than ninety (90) days if the court

53

2 subsection (1) of this section continue.
3 (3) Immediately upon filing of a petition for an emergency conserva-
4 tor, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the respondent in the
5 proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section,

7 shall be given to the respondent, the respondent's attorney, and any other
8 person as the court determines.
9 (4) The court may appoint an emergency conservator without notice to
10 the respondent and any attorney for the respondent only if the court finds
11 from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's property or financial
12 interests will be substantially and irreparably harmed before a hearing with
13 notice on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emergency
14 conservator without giving notice under subsection (3) of this section, the
15 court shall give notice of the appointment not later than forty-eight (48)
16 hours after the appointment to:
17 (a) The respondent;
18 (b) The respondent's attorney; and
19 (c) Any other person as the court determines.
20 (5) Not later than seven (7) days after the appointment, the court shall
21 hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment.
22 (6) Appointment of an emergency conservator under this section is not
23 a determination that a basis exists for appointment of a conservator under
24 section 15-5-401, Idaho Code.
25 (7) The court may remove an emergency conservator appointed under this
26 section at any time. The emergency conservator shall make any report the

43 of the conservatorship, or revoke or amend a trust revocable by the in-
44 dividual subject to conservatorship;
45 (f) Exercise a right to elect an option or change a beneficiary under an
46 insurance policy or annuity or surrender the policy or annuity for its
47 cash value;

4 (h) Grant a creditor priority for payment over creditors of the same or
5 higher class if the creditor is providing property or services used to
6 meet the basic living and care needs of the individual subject to con-
7 servatorship and preferential treatment otherwise would be impermissi-
8 ble under section 15-5-428(5), Idaho Code; and
9 (i) Acquire an undivided interest in property in which the conservator,
10 in a fiduciary capacity, holds an undivided interest.
11 (2) In approving a conservator's exercise of a power listed in subsec-
12 tion (1) of this section, the court shall consider primarily the decision the
13 individual subject to conservatorship would make if able, to the extent the
14 decision can be ascertained.
15 (3) To determine under subsection (2) of this section the decision the
16 individual subject to conservatorship would make if able, the court shall
17 consider the individual subject to conservatorship's prior or current di-
18 rections, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to the extent actu-
19 ally known or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator. The court also
20 shall consider:
21 (a) The financial needs of the individual subject to conservatorship
22 and individuals who are in fact dependent on the individual subject to
23 conservatorship for support, and the interests of creditors of the in-
24 dividual subject to conservatorship;
25 (b) Possible reduction of income, estate, inheritance, or other tax li-
26 abilities;
27 (c) Eligibility for governmental assistance;
28 (d) The previous pattern of giving or level of support provided by the
29 individual subject to conservatorship;
30 (e) Any existing estate plan or lack of estate plan of the individual
31 subject to conservatorship;

36 (4) A conservator may not revoke or amend a power of attorney for fi-
37 nances executed by the individual subject to conservatorship. If a power of
38 attorney for finances is in effect, a decision of the agent takes precedence
39 over that of the conservator, unless the court orders otherwise.
40 15-5-415. PETITION FOR ORDER AFTER APPOINTMENT. An individual subject
41 to conservatorship or a person interested in the welfare of the individual
42 subject to conservatorship may petition for an order:

55
1 (4) Removing the conservator and appointing a temporary or successor

6 needs, including because the individual subject to conservatorship's abili-
7 ties or supports have changed;
8 (6) Rejecting or modifying the conservator's plan under section 15-5-

11 (7) Granting other appropriate relief.
12 15-5-416. BOND -- ALTERNATIVE ASSET-PROTECTION ARRANGEMENT. (1) Ex-
13 cept as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, the court shall
14 require a conservator to furnish a bond with a surety the court specifies, or
15 require an alternative asset-protection arrangement, conditioned on faith-
16 ful discharge of all duties of the conservator. The court may waive the re-
17 quirement only if the court finds that a bond or other asset-protection ar-
18 rangement is not necessary to protect the interests of the individual sub-
19 ject to conservatorship. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of
20 this section, the court may not waive the requirement if the conservator is
21 in the business of serving as a conservator and is being paid for the service.
22 (2) Unless the court directs otherwise, the bond required under this
23 section shall be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the conser-
24 vatorship estate, plus one (1) year's estimated income, less the value of
25 property deposited under an arrangement requiring a court order for its re-
26 moval and real property the conservator lacks power to sell or convey without
27 specific court authorization. The court, in place of surety on a bond, may
28 accept collateral for the performance of the bond, including a pledge of se-
29 curities or a mortgage of real property.
30 (3) A regulated financial-service institution qualified to do trust
31 business in this state is not required to give a bond under this section.

33 ply to the bond required under section 15-5-416, Idaho Code:
34 (a) Except as otherwise provided by the bond, the surety and the conser-
35 vator are jointly and severally liable;
36 (b) By executing a bond provided by a conservator, the surety submits
37 to the personal jurisdiction of the court that issued letters of office
38 to the conservator in a proceeding relating to the duties of the conser-
39 vator in which the surety is named as a party. Notice of the proceeding
40 shall be given to the surety at the address shown in the records of the
41 court in which the bond is filed and any other address of the surety then
42 known to the person required to provide the notice;
43 (c) Upon petition of a successor conservator or person affected by
44 a breach of the obligation of the bond, a proceeding may be brought
45 against the surety for breach of the obligation of the bond; and
46 (d) A proceeding against the bond may be brought until liability under
47 the bond is exhausted.

56
1 (2) A proceeding may not be brought under this section against a surety
2 of a bond on a matter as to which a proceeding against the conservator is
3 barred.
4 (3) If a bond under section 15-5-416, Idaho Code, is not renewed by the
5 conservator, the surety or sureties immediately shall give notice to the
6 court and the individual subject to conservatorship.

8 has duties of prudence and loyalty to the individual subject to conservator-
9 ship.
10 (2) A conservator shall promote the self-determination of the individ-
11 ual subject to conservatorship and, to the extent feasible, encourage the
12 individual subject to conservatorship to participate in decisions, act on
13 the individual subject to conservatorship's own behalf, and develop or re-
14 gain the capacity to manage the individual subject to conservatorship's per-
15 sonal affairs.
16 (3) In making a decision for an individual subject to conservatorship,
17 the conservator shall make the decision the conservator reasonably believes
18 the individual subject to conservatorship would make if able, unless doing
19 so would fail to preserve the resources needed to maintain the individual
20 subject to conservatorship's well-being and lifestyle or otherwise unrea-
21 sonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of
22 the individual subject to conservatorship. To determine the decision the
23 individual subject to conservatorship would make if able, the conservator
24 shall consider the individual subject to conservatorship's prior or current
25 directions, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to the extent actu-
26 ally known or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator.
27 (4) If a conservator cannot make a decision under subsection (3) of
28 this section because the conservator does not know and cannot reasonably
29 determine the decision the individual subject to conservatorship probably
30 would make if able, or the conservator reasonably believes the decision the
31 individual subject to conservatorship would make would fail to preserve
32 resources needed to maintain the individual subject to conservatorship's
33 well-being and lifestyle or otherwise unreasonably harm or endanger the
34 welfare or personal or financial interests of the individual subject to con-
35 servatorship, the conservator shall act in accordance with the best interest
36 of the individual subject to conservatorship. In determining the best in-
37 terest of the individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator shall
38 consider:
39 (a) Information received from professionals and persons that demon-
40 strate sufficient interest in the welfare of the individual subject to
41 conservatorship;
42 (b) Other information the conservator believes the individual subject
43 to conservatorship would have considered if the individual subject to
44 conservatorship were able to act; and
45 (c) Other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the in-
46 dividual subject to conservatorship would consider, including conse-
47 quences for others.

57
1 (5) Except when inconsistent with the conservator's duties under sub-
2 sections (1) through (4) of this section, a conservator shall invest and man-
3 age the conservatorship estate as a prudent investor would, by considering:
4 (a) The circumstances of the individual subject to conservatorship and
5 the conservatorship estate;
6 (b) General economic conditions;
7 (c) The possible effect of inflation or deflation;
8 (d) The expected tax consequences of an investment decision or strat-
9 egy;
10 (e) The role of each investment or course of action in relation to the
11 conservatorship estate as a whole;
12 (f) The expected total return from income and appreciation of capital;
13 (g) The need for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation or
14 appreciation of capital; and
15 (h) The special relationship or value, if any, of specific property to
16 the individual subject to conservatorship.
17 (6) The propriety of a conservator's investment and management of the
18 conservatorship estate is determined in light of the facts and circumstances
19 existing when the conservator decides or acts and not by hindsight.
20 (7) A conservator shall make a reasonable effort to verify facts rele-
21 vant to the investment and management of the conservatorship estate.
22 (8) A conservator that has special skills or expertise, or is named con-
23 servator in reliance on the conservator's representation of special skills
24 or expertise, has a duty to use the special skills or expertise in carrying
25 out the conservator's duties.
26 (9) In investing, selecting specific property for distribution, and
27 invoking a power of revocation or withdrawal for the use or benefit of the
28 individual subject to conservatorship, a conservator shall consider any es-
29 tate plan of the individual subject to conservatorship known or reasonably
30 ascertainable to the conservator and may examine the will or other donative,
31 nominative, or appointive instrument of the individual.
32 (10) A conservator shall maintain insurance on the insurable real and
33 personal property of the individual subject to conservatorship, unless the
34 conservatorship estate lacks sufficient funds to pay for insurance or the
35 court finds:
36 (a) The property lacks sufficient equity; or
37 (b) Insuring the property would unreasonably dissipate the conserva-
38 torship estate or otherwise not be in the best interest of the individ-
39 ual subject to conservatorship.
40 (11) If a power of attorney for finances is in effect, a conservator
41 shall cooperate with the agent to the extent feasible.
42 (12) A conservator has access to and authority over a digital asset of
43 the individual subject to conservatorship to the extent provided in chapter
44 14, title 15, Idaho Code, the revised uniform fiduciary access to digital as-
45 sets act, or court order.
46 (13) A conservator for an adult individual subject to conservatorship
47 shall notify the court if the condition of the adult individual subject to
48 conservatorship has changed so that the adult individual subject to conser-
49 vatorship is capable of exercising rights previously removed. The notice
50 shall be given immediately on learning of the change.

58
1 15-5-419. CONSERVATOR'S PLAN. A plan required of a conservator ap-
2 pointed pursuant to this part shall conform to Idaho supreme court rules.

4 after appointment, a conservator shall prepare and file with the appointing
5 court a detailed inventory of the conservatorship estate, together with an
6 oath or affirmation that the inventory is believed to be complete and accu-
7 rate as far as information permits.
8 (2) A conservator shall give notice of the filing of an inventory to the
9 individual subject to conservatorship, any person entitled to notice under
10 section 15-5-411(5), Idaho Code, or a subsequent order, and any other person
11 as the court determines. The notice shall be given not later than seven (7)
12 days after the filing.
13 (3) A conservator shall keep records of the administration of the con-
14 servatorship estate and make them available for examination upon reasonable
15 request of the individual subject to conservatorship, a guardian for the in-
16 dividual subject to conservatorship, or any other person as the conservator
17 or the court determines.
18 15-5-421. ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF CONSERVATOR NOT REQUIRING COURT
19 APPROVAL. (1) Except as otherwise provided in section 15-5-414, Idaho Code,
20 or qualified or limited in the court's order of appointment and stated in the
21 letters of office, a conservator has all powers granted in this section and
22 any additional power granted to a trustee by law of this state other than this
23 chapter.
24 (2) A conservator, acting reasonably and consistent with the fiduciary
25 duties of the conservator to accomplish the purpose of the conservatorship,

15 15-5-422. DISTRIBUTION FROM CONSERVATORSHIP ESTATE. Except as other-
16 wise provided in section 15-5-414, Idaho Code, or qualified or limited in
17 the court's order of appointment and stated in the letters of conservator-
18 ship, and unless contrary to a conservator's plan under section 15-5-419,
19 Idaho Code, the conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of
20 the conservatorship estate without specific court authorization or confir-
21 mation for the support, care, education, health, or welfare of the individ-
22 ual subject to conservatorship or an individual who is in fact dependent on
23 the individual subject to conservatorship, including the payment of child or
24 spousal support, in accordance with the following rules:
25 (1) The conservator shall consider a recommendation relating to the ap-
26 propriate standard of support, care, education, health, or welfare for the
27 individual subject to conservatorship or individual who is dependent on the
28 individual subject to conservatorship, made by a guardian for the individual
29 subject to conservatorship, if any, and, if the individual subject to con-
30 servatorship is a minor, a recommendation made by a parent of the minor.
31 (2) The conservator acting in compliance with the conservator's duties
32 under section 15-5-418, Idaho Code, is not liable for an expenditure or dis-
33 tribution made based on a recommendation under subsection (1) of this sec-
34 tion unless the conservator knows or should have known the expenditure or
35 distribution is not in the best interest of the individual subject to conser-
36 vatorship.
37 (3) In making an expenditure or distribution under this section, the
38 conservator shall consider:
39 (a) The size of the conservatorship estate, the estimated duration
40 of the conservatorship, and the likelihood the individual subject to
41 conservatorship, at some future time, may be fully self-sufficient and
42 able to manage the individual subject to conservatorship's financial
43 affairs and the conservatorship estate;
44 (b) The accustomed standard of living of the individual subject to con-
45 servatorship and an individual who is dependent on the individual sub-
46 ject to conservatorship;
47 (c) Other funds or sources used for the support of the individual sub-
48 ject to conservatorship; and

61
1 (d) The preferences, values, and prior directions of the individual
2 subject to conservatorship.
3 (4) Funds expended or distributed under this section may be paid by the
4 conservator to any person, including the individual subject to conservator-
5 ship, as reimbursement for expenditures the conservator might have made, or
6 in advance for services to be provided to the individual subject to conserva-
7 torship or an individual who is dependent on the individual subject to con-
8 servatorship if it is reasonable to expect the services will be performed
9 and advance payment is customary or reasonably necessary under the circum-
10 stances.
11 15-5-423. CONSERVATOR'S REPORT AND ACCOUNTING -- MONITORING. A con-
12 servator's report and accounting and the monitoring of a conservatorship
13 shall be done in accordance with Idaho supreme court rules.
14 15-5-424. ATTEMPTED TRANSFER OF PROPERTY BY INDIVIDUAL SUBJECT TO
15 CONSERVATORSHIP. (1) The interest of an individual subject to conservator-
16 ship in property included in the conservatorship estate is not transferable
17 or assignable by the individual subject to conservatorship and is not
18 subject to levy, garnishment, or similar process for claims against the in-
19 dividual subject to conservatorship unless allowed under section 15-5-428,
20 Idaho Code.
21 (2) If an individual subject to conservatorship enters into a contract
22 after having the right to enter the contract removed by the court, the con-
23 tract is void against the individual subject to conservatorship and the in-
24 dividual subject to conservatorship's property but is enforceable against
25 the person that contracted with the individual subject to conservatorship.
26 (3) A person other than the conservator that deals with an individual
27 subject to conservatorship with respect to property included in the con-
28 servatorship estate is entitled to protection provided by law of this state
29 other than this chapter.
30 15-5-425. TRANSACTION INVOLVING CONFLICT OF INTEREST. A transaction
31 involving a conservatorship estate that is affected by a substantial con-
32 flict between the conservator's fiduciary duties and personal interests is
33 voidable unless the transaction is authorized by court order after notice to
34 persons entitled to notice under section 15-5-411(5), Idaho Code, or a sub-
35 sequent order. A transaction affected by a substantial conflict includes a
36 sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving the conservatorship es-
37 tate entered into by the conservator, an individual with whom the conserva-
38 tor resides, the spouse, descendant, sibling, agent, or attorney of the con-
39 servator, or a corporation or other enterprise in which the conservator has a
40 substantial beneficial interest.
41 15-5-426. PROTECTION OF PERSON DEALING WITH CONSERVATOR. (1) A person
42 that assists or deals with a conservator in good faith and for value in any
43 transaction, other than a transaction requiring a court order under section
44 15-5-414, Idaho Code, is protected as though the conservator properly exer-
45 cised any power in question. Knowledge by a person that the person is deal-
46 ing with a conservator alone does not require the person to inquire into the

62
1 existence of authority of the conservator or the propriety of the conserva-
2 tor's exercise of authority, but restrictions on authority stated in letters
3 of office, or otherwise provided by law, are effective as to the person. A
4 person that pays or delivers property to a conservator is not responsible for
5 proper application of the property.
6 (2) Protection under subsection (1) of this section extends to a pro-
7 cedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the proceeding leading to
8 the issuance of letters of office and does not substitute for protection for
9 a person that assists or deals with a conservator provided by comparable pro-
10 visions in law of this state other than this chapter relating to a commercial
11 transaction or simplifying a transfer of securities by a fiduciary.
12 15-5-427. DEATH OF INDIVIDUAL SUBJECT TO CONSERVATORSHIP. (1) If an
13 individual subject to conservatorship dies, the conservator shall deliver
14 to the court for safekeeping any will of the individual subject to conserva-
15 torship in the conservator's possession and inform the personal representa-
16 tive named in the will if feasible, or if not feasible, a beneficiary named in
17 the will, of the delivery.
18 (2) If forty (40) days after the death of an individual subject to con-
19 servatorship no personal representative has been appointed and no applica-
20 tion or petition for appointment is before the court, the conservator may ap-
21 ply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative to admin-
22 ister and distribute the decedent's estate. The conservator shall give no-
23 tice to a person nominated as personal representative by a will of the dece-
24 dent of which the conservator is aware. The court may grant the application
25 if there is no objection and endorse the letters of office to note that the
26 individual formerly subject to conservatorship is deceased and the conser-
27 vator has acquired the powers and duties of a personal representative.
28 (3) Issuance of an order under this section has the effect of an order
29 of appointment of a personal representative under section 15-3-307, Idaho
30 Code, and parts 6 through 10 of chapter 3, title 15, Idaho Code.
31 (4) Upon the death of an individual subject to conservatorship, the
32 conservator shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship estate
33 as provided in section 15-5-431, Idaho Code.
34 15-5-428. PRESENTATION AND ALLOWANCE OF CLAIM. (1) A conservator may
35 pay, or secure by encumbering property included in the conservatorship es-
36 tate, a claim against the conservatorship estate or the individual subject
37 to conservatorship arising before or during the conservatorship upon pre-
38 sentation and allowance in accordance with the priorities under subsection
39 (4) of this section. A claimant may present a claim by:
40 (a) Sending or delivering to the conservator a statement in a record of
41 the claim, indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant,
42 and the amount claimed; or
43 (b) Filing the claim with the court, in a form acceptable to the court,
44 and sending or delivering a copy of the claim to the conservator.
45 (2) A claim under subsection (1) of this section is presented on receipt
46 by the conservator of the statement of the claim or the filing with the court
47 of the claim, whichever first occurs. A presented claim is allowed if it is
48 not disallowed in whole or in part by the conservator in a record sent or de-

63
1 livered to the claimant not later than sixty (60) days after its presenta-
2 tion. Before payment, the conservator may change an allowance of the claim
3 to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a court
4 order or order directing payment of the claim. Presentation of a claim tolls
5 the running of a statute of limitations that has not expired relating to the
6 claim until thirty (30) days after its disallowance.
7 (3) A claimant whose claim under subsection (1) of this section has not
8 been paid may petition the court to determine the claim at any time before it
9 is barred by a statute of limitations, and the court may order its allowance,
10 payment, or security by encumbering property included in the conservator-
11 ship estate. If a proceeding is pending against the individual subject to
12 conservatorship at the time of appointment of the conservator or is initi-
13 ated thereafter, the moving party shall give the conservator notice of the
14 proceeding if it could result in creating a claim against the conservator-
15 ship estate.
16 (4) If a conservatorship estate is likely to be exhausted before all ex-
17 isting claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in money
18 or in kind in payment of claims in the following order:
19 (a) Costs and expenses of administration;
20 (b) A claim of the federal or state government having priority under law
21 other than this chapter;
22 (c) A claim incurred by the conservator for support, care, education,
23 health, or welfare previously provided to the individual subject to
24 conservatorship or an individual who is in fact dependent on the indi-
25 vidual subject to conservatorship;
26 (d) A claim arising before the conservatorship; and
27 (e) All other claims.
28 (5) Preference may not be given in the payment of a claim under subsec-
29 tion (4) of this section over another claim of the same class. A claim due and
30 payable may not be preferred over a claim not due unless:
31 (a) Doing so would leave the conservatorship estate without sufficient
32 funds to pay the basic living and health care expenses of the individual
33 subject to conservatorship; and
34 (b) The court authorizes the preference under section 15-5-414(1)(h),
35 Idaho Code.
36 (6) If assets of a conservatorship estate are adequate to meet all ex-
37 isting claims, the court, acting in the best interest of the individual sub-
38 ject to conservatorship, may order the conservator to grant a security in-
39 terest in the conservatorship estate for payment of a claim at a future date.
40 15-5-429. PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CONSERVATOR. (1) Except as otherwise
41 agreed by a conservator, the conservator is not personally liable for a con-
42 tract properly entered into in a fiduciary capacity in the course of adminis-
43 tration of the conservatorship estate unless the conservator fails to reveal
44 the conservator's representative capacity in the contract or before enter-
45 ing into the contract.
46 (2) A conservator is personally liable for an obligation arising from
47 control of property of the conservatorship estate or an act or omission oc-
48 curring in the course of administration of the conservatorship estate only
49 if the conservator is personally at fault.

64
1 (3) A claim based on a contract entered into by a conservator in a fidu-
2 ciary capacity, an obligation arising from control of property included in
3 the conservatorship estate, or a tort committed in the course of administra-
4 tion of the conservatorship estate may be asserted against the conservator-
5 ship estate in a proceeding against the conservator in a fiduciary capacity,
6 whether or not the conservator is personally liable for the claim.
7 (4) A question of liability between a conservatorship estate and the
8 conservator personally may be determined in a proceeding for accounting,
9 surcharge, or indemnification or another appropriate proceeding or action.
10 15-5-430. REMOVAL OF CONSERVATOR -- APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR. (1) The
11 court may remove a conservator for failure to perform the conservator's du-

17 vator, or a person interested in the welfare of the individual subject
18 to conservatorship that contains allegations that, if true, would sup-
19 port a reasonable belief that removal of the conservator and appoint-
20 ment of a successor may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold
21 a hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts
22 was filed during the preceding six (6) months;
23 (b) Communication from the individual subject to conservatorship,
24 the conservator, or a person interested in the welfare of the individ-
25 ual subject to conservatorship that supports a reasonable belief that
26 removal of the conservator and appointment of a successor may be appro-
27 priate; or
28 (c) Determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best in-
29 terest of the individual subject to conservatorship.
30 (3) Notice of a petition under subsection (2)(a) of this section shall

17 servatorship or for other good cause; or
18 (b) Modification of the conservatorship on the grounds that the extent
19 of protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good
20 cause.
21 (4) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination or
22 modification of a conservatorship is appropriate upon:
23 (a) Petition under subsection (3) of this section that contains alle-
24 gations that, if true, would support a reasonable belief that termi-

34 conservatorship or supports or services available to the individual
35 subject to conservatorship have changed;
36 (c) A report from a guardian or conservator that indicates that termi-
37 nation or modification may be appropriate because the functional needs

40 torship or other less restrictive alternative is available; or
41 (d) A determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best in-
42 terest of the individual subject to conservatorship.
43 (5) Notice of a petition under subsection (3) of this section shall be

48 basis for appointment of a conservator under section 15-5-401, Idaho Code,
49 exists.

66
1 (7) The court shall modify the powers granted to a conservator if the
2 powers are excessive or inadequate due to a change in the abilities or limi-
3 tations of the individual subject to conservatorship, supports given to the
4 individual subject to conservatorship, or other circumstances.
5 (8) Unless the court otherwise orders for good cause, before terminat-
6 ing a conservatorship, the court shall follow the same procedures to safe-

20 report and petition for discharge on approval by the court of the final re-
21 port.
22 (11) Upon termination of a conservatorship by reason of the death of
23 the individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator promptly shall

26 proceed expeditiously to distribute the conservatorship estate to the in-

24 ents unless the court concludes that the parent or parents are incapable or
25 unwilling to act reasonably and in the best interest of the minor. Such pro-
26 posed compromise is not effective until it is approved by the district court
27 of the county where the minor resides or, if the minor is not a resident of
28 the state of Idaho, by the district court of the county where the claim arose,
29 upon verified petition, filed with the court.

44 portionment of those proceeds, and whether the fees and expenses are to
45 be deducted before or after the calculation of any contingency fee, in-
46 cluding the amount to be used for:
47 (i) Attorney's fees and whether the attorney's fees are fixed or
48 contingent fees;
49 (ii) Medical expenses; or

5 tance of the compromise will bar the minor from seeking further relief
6 from the third person offering the compromise;

19 prove the compromise or set a hearing. If the minor's claim is ten thousand
20 dollars ($10,000) or more, the court shall set a hearing for approval of the
21 compromise.

23 terest of the minor, the court may approve such compromise and may direct
24 that money be paid:
25 (a) To the parents, guardian, trustee, conservator, legal representa-
26 tive, or the designated payee thereof in accordance with the provisions
27 of this chapter;
28 (b) Subject to the provisions of an appropriate protective order; or
29 (c) In accordance with the provisions of chapter 14, title 68, Idaho
30 Code.

35 nated as Part 5, Chapter 5, Title 15, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
36 PART 5

41 a protective arrangement instead of guardianship as a less restrictive

45 restrictive alternative to conservatorship.

47 a conservator for the adult, may petition under this part for a protective
48 arrangement instead of guardianship.

1 (3) The following persons may petition under this part for a protective
2 arrangement instead of conservatorship:
3 (a) The individual for whom the protective arrangement is sought;

11 Code, for a guardianship or under section 15-5-501(2), Idaho Code, for a
12 protective arrangement instead of guardianship, the court may issue an order
13 under subsection (2) of this section for a protective arrangement instead of
14 guardianship if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
15 (a) The respondent lacks the ability to meet essential requirements for
16 physical health, safety, or self-care because the respondent is unable
17 to receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions,
18 even with appropriate supportive services, technological assistance,
19 or supported decision-making; and
20 (b) The respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a less restric-
21 tive alternative.
22 (2) If the court makes the findings under subsection (1) of this sec-
23 tion, the court, instead of appointing a guardian, may:
24 (a) Authorize or direct a transaction necessary to meet the respon-
25 dent's need for health, safety, or care, including:
26 (i) A particular medical treatment or refusal of a particular
27 medical treatment;

29 (iii) Visitation or supervised visitation between the respondent
30 and another person;
31 (b) Restrict access to the respondent by a specified person whose ac-
32 cess places the respondent at serious risk of physical, psychological,
33 or financial harm; and
34 (c) Order other arrangements on a limited basis that are appropriate.
35 (3) In deciding whether to issue an order under this section, the court
36 shall consider the factors under sections 15-5-313 and 15-5-314, Idaho Code,
37 that a guardian shall consider when making a decision on behalf of an adult
38 subject to guardianship.
39 15-5-503. BASIS FOR PROTECTIVE ARRANGEMENT INSTEAD OF CONSERVATOR-
40 SHIP FOR ADULT OR MINOR. (1) After the hearing on a petition under section
41 15-5-402, Idaho Code, for conservatorship for an adult or under section
42 15-5-501(3), Idaho Code, for a protective arrangement instead of conserva-
43 torship for an adult, the court may issue an order under subsection (3) of
44 this section for a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship for the
45 adult if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
46 (a) The adult is unable to manage property or financial affairs be-
47 cause:

70
1 (i) The adult is limited in the ability to receive and evaluate
2 information or make or communicate decisions, even with appropri-
3 ate supportive services, technological assistance, or supported
4 decision-making; or

11 port, care, education, health, or welfare of the adult or an indi-
12 vidual entitled to the adult's support; and

14 tive alternative.
15 (2) After the hearing on a petition under section 15-5-402, Idaho Code,
16 for conservatorship for a minor or under section 15-5-501(3), Idaho Code,
17 for a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship for a minor, the
18 court may issue an order under subsection (3) of this section for a protec-
19 tive arrangement instead of conservatorship for the minor if the court finds
20 by a preponderance of the evidence that the arrangement is in the minor's
21 best interest, and:
22 (a) If the minor has a parent, the court gives weight to any recommenda-
23 tion of the parent whether an arrangement is in the minor's best inter-
24 est;
25 (b) Either:
26 (i) The minor owns money or property requiring management or pro-
27 tection that otherwise cannot be provided;
28 (ii) The minor has or may have financial affairs that may be put at
29 unreasonable risk or hindered because of the minor's age; or
30 (iii) The arrangement is necessary or desirable to obtain or pro-
31 vide funds or other property needed for the support, care, educa-
32 tion, health, or welfare of the minor; and

34 sirable to obtain or provide money needed for the support, care, educa-
35 tion, health, or welfare of the minor.
36 (3) If the court makes the findings under subsection (1) or (2) of this
37 section, the court, instead of appointing a conservator, may:
38 (a) Authorize or direct a transaction necessary to protect the finan-
39 cial interest or property of the respondent, including:
40 (i) An action to establish eligibility for benefits;
41 (ii) Payment, delivery, deposit, or retention of funds or prop-
42 erty;
43 (iii) Sale, mortgage, lease, or other transfer of property;
44 (iv) Purchase of an annuity;
45 (v) Entry into a contractual relationship, including a contract
46 to provide for personal care, supportive services, education,
47 training, or employment;
48 (vi) Addition to or establishment of a trust;

71
1 (vii) Ratification or invalidation of a contract, trust, will, or
2 other transaction, including a transaction related to the prop-
3 erty or business affairs of the respondent; or
4 (viii) Settlement of a claim; or
5 (b) Restrict access to the respondent's property by a specified person
6 whose access to the property places the respondent at serious risk of
7 financial harm.
8 (4) After the hearing on a petition under section 15-5-501(1)(b) or
9 (3), Idaho Code, whether or not the court makes the findings under subsection
10 (1) or (2) of this section, the court may issue an order to restrict access to
11 the respondent or the respondent's property by a specified person that the
12 court finds by clear and convincing evidence:
13 (a) Through fraud, coercion, duress, or the use of deception and con-
14 trol caused or attempted to cause an action that would have resulted in
15 financial harm to the respondent or the respondent's property; and
16 (b) Poses a serious risk of substantial financial harm to the respon-
17 dent or the respondent's property.
18 (5) Before issuing an order under subsection (3) or (4) of this section,
19 the court shall consider the factors under section 15-5-418, Idaho Code,
20 that a conservator shall consider when making a decision on behalf of an in-
21 dividual subject to conservatorship.
22 (6) Before issuing an order under subsection (3) or (4) of this section
23 for a respondent who is a minor, the court shall also consider the best inter-
24 est of the minor, the preference of the parents of the minor, and the prefer-
25 ence of the minor, if the minor is twelve (12) years of age or older.
26 15-5-504. PETITION FOR PROTECTIVE ARRANGEMENT. A petition for a pro-

28 of examination shall be paid by the defendant if he is financially able. The
29 determination of ability to pay shall be made in accordance with chapter 8,
30 title 19, Idaho Code.
31 (2) Within three (3) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal hol-
32 idays, of the appointment or designation, the examiner shall determine the
33 best location for the examination. If practical, the examination shall be
34 conducted locally on an outpatient basis.
35 (3) If the examiner determines that confinement is necessary for pur-
36 poses of the examination, the court may order the defendant to be confined to
37 a jail, a hospital, or other suitable facility for that purpose for a period
38 not exceeding thirty (30) days. The order of confinement shall require the
39 county sheriff to transport the defendant to and from the facility and shall
40 notify the facility of any known medical, behavioral, or security require-
41 ments of the defendant. The court, upon request, may make available to the
42 examiner any court records relating to the defendant.
43 (4) In such examination, any method may be employed that is accepted by
44 the examiner's profession for the examination of those alleged not to be com-
45 petent to assist counsel in their defense.
46 (5) Upon completion of the examination, a report shall be submitted to
47 the court and shall include the following:

82
1 (a) A description of the nature of the examination;
2 (b) A diagnosis or evaluation of the mental condition of the defendant;
3 (c) An opinion as to the defendant's capacity to understand the pro-
4 ceedings against him and to assist in his own defense;
5 (d) An opinion whether the defendant lacks the capacity to make in-
6 formed decisions about treatment. "Lack of capacity to make informed
7 decisions about treatment" means the defendant's inability, by reason
8 of his mental condition, to achieve a rudimentary understanding of the
9 purpose, nature, and possible significant risks and benefits of treat-
10 ment, after conscientious efforts at explanation.
11 (6) If the examination cannot be conducted by reason of the unwilling-
12 ness of the defendant to participate therein, the report shall so state and
13 shall include, if possible, an opinion as to whether such unwillingness of
14 the defendant was the result of mental disease or defect.
15 (7) The report of the examination shall be filed with the clerk of the
16 court, who shall cause copies to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney and
17 to counsel for the defendant.
18 (8) When the defendant wishes to be examined by an expert of his own
19 choice, such examiner shall be permitted to have reasonable access to the de-
20 fendant for the purpose of examination.
21 (9) In the event a defendant is suspected of being developmentally
22 disabled, the examination shall proceed with those experts set out in
23 subsection (7) of section 66-402(6), Idaho Code.
24 (10) In addition to the psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or evalua-
25 tion committee, the court may appoint additional experts to examine the de-
26 fendant.
27 (11) If, at any time during the examination process, the examiner has
28 reason to believe that the defendant's alleged incompetency may be the
29 result of a developmental disability and the matter has not already been
30 referred to an evaluation committee for review, the examiner shall immedi-
31 ately notify the court. The court shall then appoint an evaluation committee
32 or shall order the department of health and welfare to designate, within
33 two (2) business days, an evaluation committee consistent with section
34 66-402(7)(6), Idaho Code.
35 (12) If the defendant lacks capacity to make informed decisions about
36 treatment, as defined in section 66-317, Idaho Code, the court may authorize
37 consent to be given pursuant to section 66-322, Idaho Code. If the defen-
38 dant lacks capacity to make informed decisions as defined in subsection (9)
39 of section 66-402(8), Idaho Code, the court may authorize consent to be given
40 pursuant to sections 66-404 and 66-405 chapter 5, title 15, Idaho Code.
41 (13) If the defendant was confined solely for the purpose of examina-
42 tion, he shall be released from the facility within three (3) days, excluding
43 Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, following notification of completion
44 of the examination.
45 SECTION 13. That Section 18-212, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
46 amended to read as follows:
47 18-212. DETERMINATION OF FITNESS OF DEFENDANT TO PROCEED -- SUSPEN-
48 SION OF PROCEEDING AND COMMITMENT OF DEFENDANT -- POSTCOMMITMENT HEAR-
49 ING. (1) When the defendant's fitness to proceed is drawn in question, the

83
1 issue shall be determined by the court. The court shall also determine,
2 based on the examiner's findings, whether the defendant lacks capacity to
3 make informed decisions about treatment. If neither the prosecuting attor-
4 ney nor counsel for the defendant contests the finding of the report filed
5 pursuant to section 18-211, Idaho Code, the court may make the determination
6 on the basis of such report. If the finding is contested, the court shall
7 hold a hearing on the issue. If the report is received in evidence upon such
8 hearing, the party who contests the finding thereof shall have the right to
9 summon and to cross-examine the psychiatrist or licensed psychologist who
10 submitted the report and to offer evidence upon the issue.
11 (2) If the court determines that the defendant lacks fitness to pro-
12 ceed, the proceeding against him shall be suspended, except as provided in
13 subsections (5) and (6) of this section, and the court shall commit him to
14 the custody of the director of the department of health and welfare, for a
15 period not exceeding ninety (90) days, for care and treatment at an appro-
16 priate facility of the department of health and welfare or, if the defendant
17 is found to be dangerously mentally ill as defined in section 66-1305, Idaho
18 Code, to the department of correction for a period not exceeding ninety (90)
19 days. The order of commitment shall include the finding by the court whether
20 the defendant lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment.
21 For purposes of this section, "facility" shall mean a state hospital, insti-
22 tution, mental health center, or those facilities enumerated in subsection
23 (8) of section 66-402(7), Idaho Code, equipped to evaluate or rehabilitate
24 such defendants. The order of commitment shall require the county sheriff to
25 transport the defendant to and from the facility and require an evaluation
26 of the defendant's mental condition at the time of admission to the facility
27 and a progress report on the defendant's mental condition. The progress
28 report shall include an opinion whether the defendant is fit to proceed, or
29 if not, whether there is a substantial probability the defendant will be fit
30 to proceed within the foreseeable future. If the report concludes that there
31 is a substantial probability that the defendant will be fit to proceed in
32 the foreseeable future, the court may order the continued commitment of the
33 defendant for an additional one hundred eighty (180) days. If at any time the
34 director of the facility to which the defendant is committed determines that
35 the defendant is fit to proceed, such determination shall be reported to the
36 court.
37 (3) If during a commitment under this section a defendant who has the
38 capacity to make informed decisions about treatment refuses any and all
39 treatment, or the only treatment available to restore competency for trial,
40 the court shall, within seven (7) days, excluding weekends and holidays,
41 of receiving notice of the defendant's refusal from the facility, conduct
42 a hearing on whether to order involuntary treatment or order such other
43 terms and conditions as may be determined appropriate. The burden shall be
44 on the state to demonstrate grounds for involuntary treatment including,
45 but not limited to: the prescribed treatment is essential to restore the
46 defendant's competency, the medical necessity and appropriateness of the
47 prescribed treatment, no less intrusive treatment alternative exists to
48 render the defendant competent for trial, and other relevant information.
49 If each of these findings is made by the court, treatment shall be ordered
50 consistent with the findings.

84
1 (4) Each report shall be filed with the clerk of the court, who shall
2 cause copies to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney and to counsel for
3 the defendant. Upon receipt of a report, the court shall determine, after a
4 hearing if a hearing is requested, the disposition of the defendant and the
5 proceedings against him. If the court determines that the defendant is fit
6 to proceed, the proceeding shall be resumed. If at the end of the initial
7 ninety (90) days the court determines that the defendant is unfit and there
8 is not a substantial probability the defendant will be fit to proceed within
9 the foreseeable future or if the defendant is not fit to proceed after the
10 expiration of the additional one hundred eighty (180) days, involuntary com-
11 mitment proceedings shall be instituted pursuant to either section 66-329 or
12 66-406, Idaho Code, in the court in which the criminal charge is pending.
13 (5) In its review of commitments pursuant to section 66-337, Idaho
14 Code, the department of health and welfare shall determine whether the de-
15 fendant is fit to proceed with trial. The department of health and welfare
16 shall review its commitments pursuant to chapter 4, title 66, Idaho Code,
17 and may recommend that the defendant is fit to proceed with trial. If the
18 district court which committed the defendant pursuant to section 66-406,
19 Idaho Code, agrees with the department's recommendation and finds the condi-
20 tions which justified the order pursuant to section 66-406, Idaho Code, do
21 not continue to exist, criminal proceedings may resume. If the defendant is
22 fit to proceed, the court in which the criminal charge is pending shall be
23 notified and the criminal proceedings may resume. If, however, the court is
24 of the view that so much time has elapsed, excluding any time spent free from
25 custody by reason of the escape of the defendant, since the commitment of
26 the defendant that it would be unjust to resume the criminal proceeding, the
27 court may dismiss the charge.
28 (6) If a defendant escapes from custody during his confinement, the di-
29 rector shall immediately notify the court from which committed, the pros-
30 ecuting attorney and the sheriff of the county from which committed. The
31 court shall forthwith issue an order authorizing any health officer, peace
32 officer, or the director of the institution from which the defendant escaped
33 to take the defendant into custody and immediately return him to his place of
34 confinement.

32 tion 18-3302K(4), Idaho Code, would otherwise meet the requirements for
33 issuance of a license under section 18-3302K, Idaho Code. Licenses issued
34 to individuals between the ages of eighteen (18) and twenty-one (21) years
35 under this subsection shall be easily distinguishable from licenses issued
36 pursuant to subsection (7) of this section. A license issued pursuant to
37 this subsection after July 1, 2016, shall expire on the twenty-first birth-
38 day of the licensee. A licensee, upon attaining the age of twenty-one (21)
39 years, shall be allowed to renew the license under the procedure contained in

47 52, title 67, Idaho Code, for any of the following reasons:
48 (a) Fraud or intentional misrepresentation in the obtaining of a li-
49 cense;

91
1 (b) Misuse of a license, including lending or giving a license to an-
2 other person, duplicating a license or using a license with the intent
3 to unlawfully cause harm to a person or property;
4 (c) The doing of an act or existence of a condition that would have been
5 grounds for the denial of the license by the sheriff;
6 (d) The violation of any of the terms of this section; or
7 (e) The applicant is adjudicated guilty of or receives a withheld judg-
8 ment for a crime that would have disqualified him from initially receiv-
9 ing a license.
10 (23) A person twenty-one (21) years of age or older who presents a valid
11 license to carry concealed weapons is exempt from any requirement to undergo
12 a records check at the time of purchase or transfer of a firearm from a feder-
13 ally licensed firearms dealer. Provided however, a temporary emergency li-
14 cense issued pursuant to subsection (6) of this section shall not exempt the
15 holder of the license from any records check requirement.
16 (24) The attorney general must contact the appropriate officials in
17 other states for the purpose of establishing, to the extent possible, recog-
18 nition and reciprocity of the license to carry concealed weapons by other
19 states, whether by formal agreement or otherwise. The Idaho state police
20 must keep a copy and maintain a record of all such agreements and reciprocity
21 recognitions, which must be made available to the public.
22 (25) Nothing in subsection (3) or (4) of this section shall be construed
23 to limit the existing rights of a private property owner, private tenant,
24 private employer, or private business entity. The provisions of this sub-
25 section shall not apply to any property owned by the state of Idaho or its
26 political subdivisions that is normally and habitually open to the public.
27 Such limitation on the application of this subsection shall supersede Hern-
28 don v. City of Sandpoint, 531 P.3d 1125 (Idaho 2023).
29 (a) Such limitation on the application of this subsection shall apply
30 whether such property is leased, rented, licensed, loaned, permitted,
31 or occupied, whether for consideration or not.
32 (b) Any restriction on the carrying of concealed weapons pursuant to
33 this subsection may only be invoked for public property owned by the
34 state or its political subdivisions when the use of such property is for
35 a private event by invitation only, for a commercial event that charges
36 admission, or for any other event with restricted access whether admis-
37 sion is charged or not. For any such private event, commercial event,
38 or other event, it must appear to a reasonable person that the general
39 public does not have unrestricted access to the designated public prop-
40 erty, or any subset of such property, that is normally and habitually
41 open to the public.
42 (c) Nothing in this subsection relieves any political subdivision of
43 the state of Idaho of its duties to convey or manage public property in
44 accordance with Idaho law.
45 (d) Nothing in this subsection alters or amends the provisions of sec-
46 tion 18-3302C or 18-3309, Idaho Code.
47 (26) The provisions of this section are hereby declared to be severable
48 and if any provision of this section or the application of such provision to
49 any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason, such declara-
50 tion shall not affect the validity of remaining portions of this section.
