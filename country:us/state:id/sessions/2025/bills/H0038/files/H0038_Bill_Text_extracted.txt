15 policies or contracts who, regardless of where they reside, are the ben-
16 eficiaries, assignees or payees of the persons covered under paragraph
17 (b) of this subsection.
18 (b) To persons who are owners of or certificate holders under the poli-
19 cies or contracts, other than structured settlement annuities, and in
20 each case who:

22 (ii) Are not residents, but only under all of the following condi-
23 tions:
24 1. The insurer that issued the policies or contracts is
25 domiciled in this state;
26 2. The states in which the persons reside have associations
27 similar to the association created by this chapter; and
28 3. The persons are not eligible for coverage by an asso-
29 ciation in any other state due to the fact that the insurer
30 was not licensed in the state at the time specified in the
31 state's guaranty association law.
32 (c) For structured settlement annuities specified in subsection (2) of
33 this section, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection shall not ap-
34 ply, and this chapter shall, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and
35 (e) of this subsection, provide coverage to a person who is a payee under
36 a structured settlement annuity, or beneficiary of a payee if the payee
37 is deceased, if the payee:
38 (i) Is a resident, regardless of where the contract owner re-
39 sides; or
40 (ii) Is not a resident, but only under both of the following condi-
41 tions:
2

2 annuity is a resident; or

7 sides has an association similar to the association
8 created in this chapter; and
9 2. Neither the payee or beneficiary nor the contract owner
10 is eligible for coverage by the association of the state in
11 which the payee or contract owner resides.
12 (d) The provisions of this chapter shall not provide coverage to a:

26 graph in situations where a person could be covered by the association
27 of more than one (1) state, whether as an owner, payee, beneficiary or

29 tion with other state laws to result in coverage by only one (1) associa-
30 tion.

14 tract, or as to which the policy or contract owner's rights are
15 subject to forfeiture, as of the date the member insurer becomes an
16 impaired or insolvent insurer under the provisions of this chap-

21 est or change in value determined by using the procedures defined
22 in the policy or contract will be credited as if the contractual

39 (3) The benefits that the association may become obligated to cover
40 shall in no event exceed the lesser of:

16 net cash withdrawal values;
17 (c) However, in no event shall the association be obligated to cover
18 more than:
19 (i) An aggregate of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in
20 benefits with respect to any one (1) life under paragraph (b) of
21 this subsection, except with respect to benefits for major medical

38 met by the use of assets attributable to covered policies or reimbursed
39 to the association pursuant to its subrogation and assignment rights.
40 (e) For purposes of this act, benefits provided by a long-term care

48 under a covered policy or contract that do not materially affect the economic
49 values or economic benefits of the covered policy or contract.

30 sessments shall be due not less than thirty (30) days after prior written no-
31 tice to the member insurers and shall accrue interest at eight percent (8%)
32 per annum on and after the due date.
33 (2) There shall be two (2) classes of assessments:
34 (a) Class A assessments shall be authorized and called for the purpose
35 of meeting administrative and other expenses. Class A assessments may
36 be authorized and called whether or not related to a particular impaired
37 or insolvent insurer.
38 (b) Class B assessments shall be authorized and called to the extent
39 necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under
40 section 41-4308, Idaho Code, with regard to an impaired or an insolvent
41 insurer.

48 (b) The amount of a class B assessment, except for assessments related
49 to long-term care insurance, shall be allocated for assessment purposes
10
1 among the accounts pursuant to an allocation formula, which may be based
2 on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or any
3 other standard deemed by the board of directors in its sole discretion
4 as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances.
5 (c) The amount of a class B assessment for long-term care insurance
6 shall be allocated according to a methodology selected by the associa-
7 tion and approved by the director, which methodology shall provide for
8 fifty percent (50%) of the assessment to be allocated to health member
9 insurers and fifty percent (50%) to be allocated to life and annuity
10 member insurers.
11 (d) Class B assessments against member insurers for each account shall
12 be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this
13 state by each assessed member insurer on policies covered by each ac-

25 thorized assessment not yet called within one hundred eighty (180) days
26 after the assessment is authorized.
27 (4) The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assess-
28 ment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board of directors, payment
29 of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to ful-
30 fill its contractual obligations. In the event an assessment against a mem-
31 ber insurer is abated, or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which
32 the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other mem-
33 ber insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth
34 in this section. Once the conditions that caused a deferral have been re-
35 moved or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were
36 deferred pursuant to a repayment plan approved by the association.
37 (5)(a) The total of all class B assessments authorized by the associa-
38 tion with respect to a member insurer for each account shall not in one
39 (1) calendar year exceed two percent (2%) of such insurer's premiums re-
40 ceived in this state during the calendar year preceding the assessment
41 on the policies covered by the account. If the maximum assessment, to-
42 gether with the other assets of the association in an account, does not
43 provide in any one (1) year in an account an amount sufficient to carry
44 out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional
45 funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this chapter.
46 (b) The board of directors may provide in the plan of operation a method
47 of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one (1) or more
48 impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment will be in-
49 sufficient to cover anticipated claims.
11
1 (6) The board of directors may, by an equitable method as established in
2 the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the con-
3 tribution of each insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of
4 the account exceed the amount the board of directors finds is necessary to
5 carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with re-
6 gard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subroga-
7 tion, net realized gains and income from investments.
8 A reasonable amount, as determined by the board of directors in its dis-
9 cretion, may be retained by the association in any account to provide funds
10 for the continuing and future expenses of the association and for future loss
11 claims.
12 (7) It shall be proper for any member insurer, in determining its pre-
13 mium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance within the
14 scope of this chapter, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet
15 its assessment obligations under this chapter.
16 (8) The association shall issue to each insurer paying an assessment
17 under this chapter, other than a class A assessment, a certificate of contri-
18 bution in a form prescribed by the director for the amount of the assessment
19 so paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal dignity and prior-
20 ity without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contri-
21 bution may be shown by the insurer in its financial statement as an asset in
22 such form and for such amount, if any, and period of time as the director may
23 approve.
24 (9)(a) A member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assess-
25 ment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set forth in
26 the notice provided by the association. The payment shall be available
27 to meet association obligations during the pendency of the protest or
28 any subsequent appeal. Payment shall be accompanied by a statement in
29 writing that the payment is made under protest and setting forth a brief
30 statement of the grounds for the protest.
31 (b) Within sixty (60) days following the payment of an assessment under
32 protest by a member insurer, the association shall notify the member in-
33 surer in writing of its determination with respect to the protest unless
34 the association notifies the member insurer that additional time is re-
35 quired to resolve the issues raised by the protest.
36 (c) Within thirty (30) days after a final decision has been made, the
37 association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of
38 that final decision. Within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice of the
39 final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal that final
40 action to the director.
41 (d) In the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a
42 protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the associ-
43 ation may refer protests to the director for a final decision, with or
44 without a recommendation from the association.
45 (e) If the protest or appeal on the assessment is upheld, the amount
46 paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member insurer.
47 (10) The association may request information of member insurers in or-
48 der to aid in the exercise of its power under this section, and member insur-
49 ers shall promptly comply with the request.

2 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
3 July 1, 2025.

2 RELATING TO THE IDAHO LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION ACT;
3 AMENDING SECTION 41-4303, IDAHO CODE, TO REVISE PROVISIONS REGARDING
4 COVERAGE AND LIMITATIONS; AMENDING SECTION 41-4305, IDAHO CODE, TO RE-
5 VISE A DEFINITION; AMENDING SECTION 41-4309, IDAHO CODE, TO REVISE PRO-
6 VISIONS REGARDING ASSESSMENTS; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND PROVID-
7 ING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.
8 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
9 SECTION 1. That Section 41-4303, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
10 amended to read as follows:
11 41-4303. COVERAGE AND LIMITATIONS. (1) This chapter shall provide
12 coverage for the policies and contracts specified in subsection (2) of this
13 section:
14 (a) To persons, except for nonresident certificate holders under group
15 policies or contracts who, regardless of where they reside, are the ben-
16 eficiaries, assignees or payees of the persons covered under paragraph
17 (b) of this subsection.
18 (b) To persons who are owners of or certificate holders under the poli-
19 cies or contracts, other than structured settlement annuities, and in
20 each case who:
21 (i) Are residents; or
22 (ii) Are not residents, but only under all of the following condi-
23 tions:
24 1. The insurer that issued the policies or contracts is
25 domiciled in this state;
26 2. The states in which the persons reside have associations
27 similar to the association created by this chapter; and
28 3. The persons are not eligible for coverage by an asso-
29 ciation in any other state due to the fact that the insurer
30 was not licensed in the state at the time specified in the
31 state's guaranty association law.
32 (c) For structured settlement annuities specified in subsection (2) of
33 this section, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection shall not ap-
34 ply, and this chapter shall, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and
35 (e) of this subsection, provide coverage to a person who is a payee under
36 a structured settlement annuity, or beneficiary of a payee if the payee
37 is deceased, if the payee:
38 (i) Is a resident, regardless of where the contract owner re-
39 sides; or
40 (ii) Is not a resident, but only under both of the following condi-
41 tions:

2
1 1.(A) The contract owner of the structured settlement
2 annuity is a resident; or
3 (B) The contract owner of the structured settlement
4 annuity is not a resident; but the insurer that issued
5 the structured settlement annuity is domiciled in this
6 state; and the state in which the contract owner re-
7 sides has an association similar to the association
8 created in this chapter; and
9 2. Neither the payee or beneficiary nor the contract owner
10 is eligible for coverage by the association of the state in
11 which the payee or contract owner resides.
12 (d) The provisions of this chapter shall not provide coverage to a:
13 (i) A person who is a payee or beneficiary of a contract owner res-
14 ident of this state, if the payee or beneficiary is afforded any
15 coverage by the association of another state.; or
16 (ii) A person who acquires rights to receive payments through
17 a structured settlement factoring transaction as defined in 26
18 U.S.C. 5891(c)(3)(A), regardless of whether the transaction oc-
19 curred before or after such section became effective.
20 (e) This chapter is intended to provide coverage to a person who is a
21 resident of this state and, in special circumstances, to a nonresident.
22 In order to avoid duplicate coverage, if a person who would otherwise
23 receive coverage under this chapter is provided coverage under the laws
24 of any other state, the person shall not be provided coverage under this
25 chapter. In determining the application of the provisions of this para-
26 graph in situations where a person could be covered by the association
27 of more than one (1) state, whether as an owner, payee, beneficiary or
28 assignee, the provisions of this chapter shall be construed in conjunc-
29 tion with other state laws to result in coverage by only one (1) associa-
30 tion.
31 (2)(a) The provisions of this chapter shall provide coverage to
32 the persons specified in subsection (1) of this section for direct,
33 non-group life, health or annuity policies or contracts and for cer-
34 tificates under direct group policies and contracts and for supple-
35 mental contracts to any of these, except as limited by this chapter.
36 Annuity contracts and certificates under group annuity contracts in-
37 clude allocated funding agreements, structured settlement annuities
38 and any immediate or deferred annuity contracts.
39 (b) The provisions of this chapter shall not provide coverage for:
40 (i) A portion of a policy or contract not guaranteed by the in-
41 surer, or under which the risk is borne by the policy or contract
42 owner;
43 (ii) A policy or contract of reinsurance, unless assumption cer-
44 tificates have been issued pursuant to the reinsurance policy or
45 contract;
46 (iii) A portion of a policy or contract to the extent that the rate
47 of interest on which it is based, or the interest rate, crediting
48 rate or similar factor determined by use of an index or other ex-
49 ternal reference stated in the policy or contract employed in cal-
50 culating returns or changes in value:

3

2 date on which the member insurer becomes an impaired or in-
3 solvent insurer under this chapter, whichever is earlier,
4 exceeds the rate of interest determined by subtracting two
5 (2) percentage points from Moody's corporate bond yield av-
6 erage averaged for that same four (4) year period or for such
7 lesser period if the policy or contract was issued less than
8 four (4) years before the member insurer becomes an impaired
9 or insolvent insurer under the provisions of this chapter,
10 whichever is earlier; and
11 2. On and after the date on which the member insurer be-
12 comes an impaired or insolvent insurer under the provisions
13 of this chapter, whichever is earlier, exceeds the rate of
14 interest determined by subtracting three (3) percentage
15 points from Moody's corporate bond yield average as most re-
16 cently available;
17 (iv) A portion of a policy or contract issued to a plan or pro-
18 gram of an employer, association or other person to provide life,
19 health or annuity benefits to its employees, members or others, to
20 the extent that the plan or program is self-funded or uninsured in-
21 cluding, but not limited to, benefits payable by an employer, as-
22 sociation or other person under:
23 1. A multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined in
24 section 3(40) of the employee retirement income security act
25 of 1974, 29 U.S.C. section 1002(40);
26 2. A minimum premium group insurance plan;
27 3. A stop-loss group insurance plan; or
28 4. An administrative services only contract;
29 (v) A portion of a policy or contract to the extent that it pro-
30 vides for:
31 1. Dividends or experience rating credits;
32 2. Voting rights; or
33 3. Payment of any fees or allowances to any person, includ-
34 ing the policy or contract owner, in connection with the ser-
35 vice to or administration of the policy or contract;
36 (vi) A policy or contract issued in this state by a member insurer
37 at a time when it was not licensed or did not have a certificate of
38 authority to issue the policy or contract in this state;
39 (vii) A portion of a policy or contract to the extent that the as-
40 sessments required in section 41-4309, Idaho Code, with respect to
41 the policy or contract are preempted by federal or state law;
42 (viii) An obligation that does not arise under the express written
43 terms of the policy or contract issued by the insurer to the con-
44 tract owner or policy owner, including without limitation:

47 that were issued by the insurer without meeting applicable
48 policy form filing or approval requirements;
49 3. Misrepresentations of or regarding policy benefits;
50 4. Extra-contractual claims; or

4
1 5. A claim for penalties or consequential or incidental dam-
2 ages;
3 (ix) A contractual agreement that establishes the member in-
4 surer's obligations to provide a book value accounting guaranty

7 trustee, which in each case is not an affiliate of the member in-
8 surer;
9 (x) An unallocated annuity contract;

14 tract, or as to which the policy or contract owner's rights are
15 subject to forfeiture, as of the date the member insurer becomes an
16 impaired or insolvent insurer under the provisions of this chap-
17 ter, whichever is earlier. If a policy's or contract's interest or
18 changes in value are credited less frequently than annually, then
19 for purposes of determining the values that have been credited and
20 are not subject to forfeiture under this subparagraph, the inter-
21 est or change in value determined by using the procedures defined
22 in the policy or contract will be credited as if the contractual
23 date of crediting interest or changing values was the date of im-
24 pairment or insolvency, whichever is earlier, and will not be sub-
25 ject to forfeiture; and
26 (xii) A policy or contract providing any hospital, medical, pre-

33 gardless of whether the transaction occurred before or after such
34 section became effective.
35 (c) The exclusion for coverage described in paragraph (b)(iii) of this
36 subsection shall not apply to any portion of a policy or contract, in-
37 cluding a rider, that provides long-term care or any other health insur-
38 ance benefits.
39 (3) The benefits that the association may become obligated to cover
40 shall in no event exceed the lesser of:
41 (a) The contractual obligations for which the insurer is liable or
42 would have been liable if it were not an impaired or insolvent insurer;
43 or
44 (b) Subject to the aggregate per life limitation in paragraph (c) of
45 this subsection with respect to one (1) policy or contract:
46 (i) Three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in life insurance

5 in section 41-4305, Idaho Code, and as provided for in subpara-

13 ity, or beneficiary or beneficiaries of the payee if deceased, two
14 hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) in present value annu-
15 ity benefits, in the aggregate, including net cash surrender and
16 net cash withdrawal values;
17 (c) However, in no event shall the association be obligated to cover
18 more than:
19 (i) An aggregate of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in
20 benefits with respect to any one (1) life under paragraph (b) of
21 this subsection, except with respect to benefits for major medical
22 insurance as provided in paragraph (b)(iii) of this subsection,
23 in which case the aggregate liability of the association shall not
24 exceed five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) with respect to
25 any one (1) life; or
26 (ii) With respect to one (1) owner of multiple non-group poli-
27 cies of life insurance, whether the policy owner is an individual,
28 firm, corporation or other person, and whether the persons insured
29 are officers, managers, employees or other persons, more than five
30 million dollars ($5,000,000) in benefits, regardless of the num-
31 ber of policies and contracts held by the owner; or
32 (d) The limitations set forth in this subsection are limitations on
33 the benefits for which the association is obligated before taking into
34 account either its subrogation and assignment rights or the extent to
35 which those benefits could be provided out of the assets of the impaired
36 or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies. The costs of the
37 association's obligations under the provisions of this chapter may be
38 met by the use of assets attributable to covered policies or reimbursed
39 to the association pursuant to its subrogation and assignment rights.
40 (e) For purposes of this act, benefits provided by a long-term care
41 rider to a life insurance policy or annuity contract shall be considered
42 the same type of benefits as the base life insurance policy or annuity
43 contract to which it relates.
44 (4) In performing its obligations to provide coverage under section
45 41-4308, Idaho Code, the association shall not be required to guarantee, as-
46 sume, reinsure or perform, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, reinsured or
47 performed, the contractual obligations of the insolvent or impaired insurer
48 under a covered policy or contract that do not materially affect the economic
49 values or economic benefits of the covered policy or contract.

24 SECTION 3. That Section 41-4309, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
25 amended to read as follows:
26 41-4309. ASSESSMENTS. (1) For the purpose of providing the funds nec-
27 essary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the board of
28 directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at
29 such time and for such amounts as the board of directors finds necessary. As-
30 sessments shall be due not less than thirty (30) days after prior written no-
31 tice to the member insurers and shall accrue interest at eight percent (8%)
32 per annum on and after the due date.
33 (2) There shall be two (2) classes of assessments:
34 (a) Class A assessments shall be authorized and called for the purpose
35 of meeting administrative and other expenses. Class A assessments may
36 be authorized and called whether or not related to a particular impaired
37 or insolvent insurer.
38 (b) Class B assessments shall be authorized and called to the extent
39 necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under
40 section 41-4308, Idaho Code, with regard to an impaired or an insolvent
41 insurer.
42 (3)(a) The amount of a class A assessment shall be determined by at the
43 discretion of the board of directors and may be authorized and called on
44 a pro rata or non-pro rata basis. If pro rata, the board of directors may
45 provide that it be credited against future class B assessments. The to-
46 tal of all non-pro rata assessments shall not exceed three hundred dol-
47 lars ($300) per member insurer in any one (1) calendar year.
48 (b) The amount of a class B assessment, except for assessments related
49 to long-term care insurance, shall be allocated for assessment purposes

10
1 among the accounts pursuant to an allocation formula, which may be based
2 on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or any
3 other standard deemed by the board of directors in its sole discretion
4 as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances.
5 (c) The amount of a class B assessment for long-term care insurance
6 shall be allocated according to a methodology selected by the associa-
7 tion and approved by the director, which methodology shall provide for
8 fifty percent (50%) of the assessment to be allocated to health member
9 insurers and fifty percent (50%) to be allocated to life and annuity
10 member insurers.
11 (d) Class B assessments against member insurers for each account shall
12 be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this
13 state by each assessed member insurer on policies covered by each ac-
14 count for the calendar year preceding the assessments bears to such
15 premiums received on business in this state for the calendar year pre-
16 ceding the assessment by all assessed member insurers.
17 (e) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association
18 with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer shall not be authorized
19 or called until necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.
20 Classification of assessments under this subsection and subsection (2)
21 of this section and computation of assessments under this subsection
22 shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that
23 exact determinations may not always be possible. The association shall
24 notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro rata share of an au-
25 thorized assessment not yet called within one hundred eighty (180) days
26 after the assessment is authorized.
27 (4) The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assess-
28 ment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board of directors, payment
29 of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to ful-
30 fill its contractual obligations. In the event an assessment against a mem-
31 ber insurer is abated, or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which
32 the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other mem-
33 ber insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth
34 in this section. Once the conditions that caused a deferral have been re-
35 moved or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were
36 deferred pursuant to a repayment plan approved by the association.
37 (5)(a) The total of all class B assessments authorized by the associa-
38 tion with respect to a member insurer for each account shall not in one
39 (1) calendar year exceed two percent (2%) of such insurer's premiums re-
40 ceived in this state during the calendar year preceding the assessment
41 on the policies covered by the account. If the maximum assessment, to-
42 gether with the other assets of the association in an account, does not
43 provide in any one (1) year in an account an amount sufficient to carry
44 out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional
45 funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this chapter.
46 (b) The board of directors may provide in the plan of operation a method
47 of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one (1) or more
48 impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment will be in-
49 sufficient to cover anticipated claims.

11
1 (6) The board of directors may, by an equitable method as established in
2 the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the con-
3 tribution of each insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of
4 the account exceed the amount the board of directors finds is necessary to
5 carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with re-
6 gard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subroga-
7 tion, net realized gains and income from investments.
8 A reasonable amount, as determined by the board of directors in its dis-
9 cretion, may be retained by the association in any account to provide funds
10 for the continuing and future expenses of the association and for future loss
11 claims.
12 (7) It shall be proper for any member insurer, in determining its pre-
13 mium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance within the
14 scope of this chapter, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet
15 its assessment obligations under this chapter.
16 (8) The association shall issue to each insurer paying an assessment
17 under this chapter, other than a class A assessment, a certificate of contri-
18 bution in a form prescribed by the director for the amount of the assessment
19 so paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal dignity and prior-
20 ity without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contri-
21 bution may be shown by the insurer in its financial statement as an asset in
22 such form and for such amount, if any, and period of time as the director may
23 approve.
24 (9)(a) A member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assess-
25 ment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set forth in
26 the notice provided by the association. The payment shall be available
27 to meet association obligations during the pendency of the protest or
28 any subsequent appeal. Payment shall be accompanied by a statement in
29 writing that the payment is made under protest and setting forth a brief
30 statement of the grounds for the protest.
31 (b) Within sixty (60) days following the payment of an assessment under
32 protest by a member insurer, the association shall notify the member in-
33 surer in writing of its determination with respect to the protest unless
34 the association notifies the member insurer that additional time is re-
35 quired to resolve the issues raised by the protest.
36 (c) Within thirty (30) days after a final decision has been made, the
37 association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of
38 that final decision. Within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice of the
39 final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal that final
40 action to the director.
41 (d) In the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a
42 protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the associ-
43 ation may refer protests to the director for a final decision, with or
44 without a recommendation from the association.
45 (e) If the protest or appeal on the assessment is upheld, the amount
46 paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member insurer.
47 (10) The association may request information of member insurers in or-
48 der to aid in the exercise of its power under this section, and member insur-
49 ers shall promptly comply with the request.

12

2 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
