43 second dried blood specimen. The preferred time for sample collection for
44 healthy infants is between ten (10) and fifteen (15) days of age.
45 (3) For infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU),
46 the initial dried blood specimen for newborn screening must be obtained upon

7 nating hospital shall ensure that the dried blood specimen is drawn. If the
8 newborn is too sick to have a dried blood specimen drawn for screening prior

10 pital shall document this fact and notify the hospital to which the newborn
11 is being transferred that a dried blood specimen for newborn screening has
12 not been obtained.
13 (6) Prior to the discharge of an infant from the institution where ini-
14 tial newborn care or specialized medical care was rendered, the administra-
15 tor of the institution shall ensure that an adequate dried blood specimen has
16 been collected regardless of the time the infant is discharged from the in-

19 shall ensure that an acceptable dried blood specimen is properly collected
20 for newborn screening as required by this section.

40 that a protocol for collection and submission of dried blood specimens for
41 newborn screening has been developed, documented, and implemented. The
42 protocol shall clearly define and document individual responsibilities,
43 including but not limited to requiring that the attending physician or birth
44 attendant request that the blood specimen collection be performed. The re-
45 sponsible institution may make an appropriate charge for this service and
46 seek reimbursement when available.
47 (12) The administrator of the responsible institution or a person des-
48 ignated by the administrator of the responsible institution shall record on
49 the birth certificate whether the dried blood specimen for newborn screen-
50 ing has been collected. When a birth occurs outside a hospital, the person

5

2 certificate whether the dried blood specimen for newborn screening has been
3 collected and submitted within twenty-four (24) hours following collection.
4 (13) The department of health and welfare shall provide access to new-
5 born screening laboratory services. If the administration of the respon-
6 sible institution or the person required to register the birth of a child
7 chooses to utilize this service, the department shall collect a fee equal to
8 the cost of the test kit, analytical services, and follow-up services pro-
9 vided by the laboratory. The fees must be remitted to the department before
10 the laboratory provides the test kit to those responsible for ensuring the
11 infant is tested according to this chapter.
12 (14) Laboratories receiving dried blood specimens for newborn screen-
13 ing of infants born in Idaho are encouraged to participate in the centers
14 for disease control and prevention newborn screening quality assurance pro-

19 health and welfare rules.

21 screening shall immediately report any unsatisfactory dried blood
22 specimens to the submitting institution that originated the dried blood
23 specimen or to the health care provider responsible for the newborn's

25 a repeat dried blood specimen for newborn screening from the institu-
26 tion or individual submitting the original sample or from the responsi-
27 ble provider as instructed by the newborn screening quality assurance
28 program. Upon notification from the laboratory and as instructed by the
29 newborn screening quality assurance program, the health care provider

31 lect a repeat dried blood specimen to be appropriately forwarded to the
32 laboratory for screening.
33 (b) Laboratories receiving dried blood specimens for newborn screening

37 infant's birth, and shall make recommendations on the necessity of fol-
38 low-up testing.
39 (c) Confirmed positive cases of biotinidase deficiency, congenital hy-
