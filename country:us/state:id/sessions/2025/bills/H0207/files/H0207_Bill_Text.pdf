1 RULEMAKING
2 (1) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the
3 criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules
4 and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or
5 amendment.
6 (2) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a
7 rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt
8 the compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any mem-
9 ber state.
10 (3) Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or
11 special meeting of the commission.
12 (4) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the
13 commission, and at least sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting at which
14 the rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a no-
15 tice of proposed rulemaking:
16 (a) On the website of the commission; and
17 (b) On the website of each member state EMS authority or the publication
18 in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.
19 (5) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
20 (a) The proposed time, date and location of the meeting in which the
21 rule will be considered and voted upon;
22 (b) The text of the proposed rule or amendment and the reason for the
23 proposed rule;
24 (c) A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested per-
25 son; and
26 (d) The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the com-
27 mission of their intention to attend the public hearing and any written
28 comments.
29 (6) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow
30 persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which shall
31 be made available to the public.
32 (7) The commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing be-
33 fore it adopts a rule or amendment if a hearing is requested by:
34 (a) At least twenty-five (25) persons;
35 (b) A governmental subdivision or agency; or
36 (c) An association having at least twenty-five (25) members.
37 (8) If a hearing is held on the proposed rule or amendment, the commis-
38 sion shall publish the place, time and date of the scheduled public hearing.
39 (a) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall notify the ex-
40 ecutive director of the commission or other designated member in writ-
41 ing of their desire to appear and testify at the hearing not less than
42 five (5) business days before the scheduled date of the hearing.

13
1 a transcript. This subsection shall not preclude the commission from
2 making a transcript or recording of the hearing if it so chooses.
3 (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
4 hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the
5 commission at hearings required by this section.
6 (9) Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on
7 the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall
8 consider all written and oral comments received.
9 (10) The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final
10 action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the
11 rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
12 (11) If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by in-
13 terested parties is received, the commission may proceed with promulgation
14 of the proposed rule without a public hearing.
15 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may
16 consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for
17 comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided
18 in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule
19 as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after
20 the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emer-

29 recting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or
30 grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
31 website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any
32 person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be
33 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change
34 to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the chair
35 of the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is
36 made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision
37 is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the
38 commission.
39 SECTION XIII
40 OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
41 (1) Oversight.
42 (a) The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state govern-
43 ment in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all ac-
44 tions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes
45 and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated
46 hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.
47 (b) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules
48 in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertain-

14
1 ing to the subject matter of this compact that may affect the powers, re-
2 sponsibilities or actions of the commission.
3 (c) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
4 any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a pro-
5 ceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the
6 commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission,
7 this compact, or promulgated rules.
8 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination.
9 (a) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in
10 the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this com-
11 pact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written no-
12 tice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the
13 default, the proposed means of curing the default and/or any other ac-
14 tion to be taken by the commission; and provide remedial training and
15 specific technical assistance regarding the default.
16 (b) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting
17 state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
18 majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges and benefits
19 conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of
20 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state
21 of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
22 (c) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only af-
23 ter all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
24 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the
25 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's
26 legislature, and each of the member states.
27 (d) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assess-
28 ments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date
29 of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective
30 date of termination.
31 (e) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is
32 found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, un-
33 less agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting
34 state.
35 (f) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by pe-
36 titioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia
37 or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices.
38 The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, in-
39 cluding reasonable attorney's fees.
40 (3) Dispute resolution.
41 (a) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to re-
42 solve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and
43 between member and nonmember states.
44 (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation
45 and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
46 (4) Enforcement.
47 (a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall
48 enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.
49 (b) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the
50 United States district court for the District of Columbia or the fed-

15
1 eral district where the commission has its principal offices against
2 a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of
3 the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought
4 may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
5 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all
6 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
7 (c) The remedies in this section shall not be the exclusive remedies of
8 the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available
9 under federal or state law.
10 SECTION XIV
11 DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION FOR EMS PERSONNEL
12 PRACTICE AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
13 (1) The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact
14 statute is enacted into law in the tenth member state. The provisions, which
15 become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the
16 commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter,
17 the commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the
18 implementation and administration of the compact.
19 (2) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission's
20 initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist
21 on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that
22 has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and
23 effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.
24 (3) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a
25 statute repealing the same.
26 (a) A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6)
27 months after enactment of the repealing statute.
28 (b) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the with-
29 drawing state's EMS authority to comply with the investigative and ad-
30 verse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effec-
31 tive date of withdrawal.
32 (4) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
33 or prevent any EMS personnel licensure agreement or other cooperative ar-
34 rangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict
35 with the provisions of this compact.
36 (5) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to
37 this compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until
38 it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
39 SECTION XV
40 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
41 This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the pur-
42 poses thereof. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of
43 any state member thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect
44 as to the remaining member states. Nothing in this compact supersedes state
45 law or rules related to licensure of EMS agencies.
