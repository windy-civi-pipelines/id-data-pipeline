LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF IDAHO
IN THE SENATE
SENATE BILL NO. 1198
BY STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
1 AN ACT

4 SECTION 67-5909D, IDAHO CODE, TO DEFINE TERMS, TO PROHIBIT DIVERSITY,
5 EQUITY, AND INCLUSION OFFICES AND OFFICERS AT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER
6 EDUCATION, TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE USE FOR CERTAIN FUNDS, TO PROHIBIT

14 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
15 SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. The Legislature finds that
16 this state was founded upon the fundamental truth that all men are created
17 equal and endowed with inalienable rights. Among these rights is the freedom
18 of inquiry, which along with the principle of liberal toleration is essen-
19 tial to the advancement and diffusion of knowledge. The constitution of this
20 state also declares that the stability of a republican form of government de-
21 pends mainly upon the intelligence of the people. In contravention of these
22 principles, a subversive ideology derived from the tenets of critical the-
23 ory has infected the administration of this state's system of higher educa-
24 tion, promoting a culture of division, ignorance, bigotry, and intolerance.
25 Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to eliminate all programs and
26 initiatives within all public institutions of higher education predicated
27 on the tenets of critical theory, or more commonly known under the title of
28 "diversity, equity, and inclusion."
29 SECTION 2. That Chapter 59, Title 67, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
30 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
31 ignated as Section 67-5909D, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
32 67-5909D. FREEDOM OF INQUIRY IN HIGHER EDUCATION. (1) For the purpose

1 (ii) Solicit the reporting of incidents of student speech pro-
2 tected by state or federal law, including but not limited to speech

Raw Text:
LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF IDAHO
Sixty-eighth Legislature First Regular Session - 2025
IN THE SENATE
SENATE BILL NO. 1198
BY STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
1 AN ACT
2 RELATING TO HIGHER EDUCATION; PROVIDING LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT;
3 AMENDING CHAPTER 59, TITLE 67, IDAHO CODE, BY THE ADDITION OF A NEW
4 SECTION 67-5909D, IDAHO CODE, TO DEFINE TERMS, TO PROHIBIT DIVERSITY,
5 EQUITY, AND INCLUSION OFFICES AND OFFICERS AT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER
6 EDUCATION, TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE USE FOR CERTAIN FUNDS, TO PROHIBIT
7 DIVERSITY TRAININGS, TO PROHIBIT BIAS REPORTING SYSTEMS, TO PROHIBIT
8 CERTAIN REQUIRED COURSES, TO PROVIDE FOR EXEMPTIONS FROM CERTAIN RE-
9 QUIREMENTS, TO REQUIRE CERTAIN REPORTS, TO PROVIDE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
10 WITH CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY, TO PROVIDE FOR A PRIVATE CAUSE OF
11 ACTION, AND TO PROVIDE LIMITATIONS; PROVIDING SEVERABILITY; PROVIDING
12 APPLICABILITY; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE
13 DATE.
14 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
15 SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. The Legislature finds that
16 this state was founded upon the fundamental truth that all men are created
17 equal and endowed with inalienable rights. Among these rights is the freedom
18 of inquiry, which along with the principle of liberal toleration is essen-
19 tial to the advancement and diffusion of knowledge. The constitution of this
20 state also declares that the stability of a republican form of government de-
21 pends mainly upon the intelligence of the people. In contravention of these
22 principles, a subversive ideology derived from the tenets of critical the-
23 ory has infected the administration of this state's system of higher educa-
24 tion, promoting a culture of division, ignorance, bigotry, and intolerance.
25 Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to eliminate all programs and
26 initiatives within all public institutions of higher education predicated
27 on the tenets of critical theory, or more commonly known under the title of
28 "diversity, equity, and inclusion."
29 SECTION 2. That Chapter 59, Title 67, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
30 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
31 ignated as Section 67-5909D, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:
32 67-5909D. FREEDOM OF INQUIRY IN HIGHER EDUCATION. (1) For the purpose

39 disagreements of opinion, political beliefs or affiliations, or
40 perceived bias, prejudice, stereotypes, or intolerance; or

2
1 (ii) Solicit the reporting of incidents of student speech pro-
2 tected by state or federal law, including but not limited to speech
3 pertaining to disagreements of opinion, political beliefs or af-
4 filiations, or perceived bias, prejudice, stereotypes, or intol-
5 erance.
6 (b)(i) "Diversity, equity, and inclusion" or "DEI" means any
7 trainings, programs, activities, or instruction that is derived
8 from or that promotes the tenets or concepts of critical theory,
9 including but not limited to the concepts of unconscious or im-

11 appropriation, structural equity, settler colonialism, group
12 marginalization, systemic oppression, social justice, institu-

15 archy, gender theory, queer theory, neopronouns, transgender
