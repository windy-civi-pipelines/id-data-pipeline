22 censing requirements of chapter 42 16, title 54, Idaho Code, or the require-

27 care provider's primary residence.

40 nonrelative resident.
41 (6) The care provider must have sufficient resources to maintain the
42 home and the services offered.
43 (7) Information obtained by the care provider about current or prospec-

1 (i) Admission records, including but not limited to the admission
2 agreement, assessment, plan of service, history and physical ex-
3 amination, review of resident rights policy, emergency contacts,
4 advance directives if so formulated by the resident, and a list of
5 belongings the resident or resident representative chooses to in-
6 ventory; and
7 (ii) Ongoing resident records as applicable, including but not
8 limited to: medication management; incidents, accidents, or
9 changes in the resident's condition and the care provider's re-
10 sponse; and financial accounting records for use of the resident's
11 funds when the care provider is deemed to be managing such funds on
12 behalf of the resident.
13 (b) The care provider shall report at least the following:
14 (i) To the certifying agent: any incident of house fire in the
15 certified family home; any criminal investigation or conviction,
16 or child protection or adult protection investigation, when the
17 alleged perpetrator is the care provider, a substitute caregiver,
18 or any adult member of the household; any critical incident; and
19 any resident discharge from the home;
20 (ii) To the Idaho commission on aging: in accordance with section
21 39-5303, Idaho Code, any abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a vul-
22 nerable adult when the care provider has reasonable cause to be-
23 lieve that such has occurred; and
24 (iii) To local law enforcement: any serious physical injury to or
25 the death of a resident when there is reasonable cause to believe
26 the harm was due to abuse or neglect.
27 (9) The board may implement requirements to ensure the safety and ade-
28 quate care of residents. The care provider shall be responsible for ensuring
29 appropriate and adequate supervision is provided to each resident based on
30 the resident's plan of service.
31 (10) The board may implement requirements for management of medica-
32 tions, including:

42 provider allowing the resident to self-administer medications; and
43 (c) For residents who need assistance with medications:
44 (i) Conditions under which certified family home staff may offer
45 assistance, taking into consideration the resident's health sta-
46 tus, level of assistance needed, and scope of any professional li-
47 cense held by the individual offering assistance;
48 (ii) Storage and safeguarding of medications, including taking
49 regular inventory of narcotic medications;
50 (iii) Documentation of assistance; and
12
1 (iv) Proper and timely disposal of discontinued, unused, loose,
2 or expired medications.
3 (11) The certified family home staff shall allow certifying agents to
4 inspect and investigate the certified family home as necessary to determine
