IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 11
BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE
1 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
2 STATING FINDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND ENCOURAGING CITIES, COUNTIES, AND
3 OTHER GOVERNING BODIES TO SUPPORT YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS.
4 Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
5 WHEREAS, owning and operating a business provides valuable real-world
6 experience, instills a strong work ethic, and teaches the importance of per-
7 severance. Youth-run businesses, such as lemonade stands, lawn care ser-
8 vices, or craft sales, foster community engagement and build a sense of local
9 pride; and
10 WHEREAS, excessive regulation can stifle creativity and discourage
11 young entrepreneurs from exploring business opportunities. Streamlin-
12 ing processes and eliminating permitting and licensure fees for small,
13 youth-operated businesses ensures a more-accessible pathway to en-
14 trepreneurship; and
15 WHEREAS, hard work and enterprise are the bedrock of the American dream,
16 inspiring generations to contribute to their communities and the economy.
17 By empowering young people to start businesses, local governments can help
18 cultivate the next generation of innovators and leaders.
19 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses-
20 sion of the Sixty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and
21 the Senate concurring therein, that cities, counties, and other governing
22 bodies are encouraged to: (1) Consider the potential benefits to our youth
23 in encouraging exploration of entrepreneurship; (2) waive or eliminate per-
24 mitting and licensure fees for businesses owned and operated by minors; (3)
25 simplify or exempt youth businesses from certain regulatory requirements,
26 while still maintaining public health and safety standards; and (4) create
27 opportunities for young entrepreneurs to showcase their products or ser-
28 vices through community events, fairs, or markets.
