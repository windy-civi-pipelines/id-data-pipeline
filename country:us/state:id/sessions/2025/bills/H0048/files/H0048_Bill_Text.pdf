4 TO CARRY A CONCEALED WEAPON AND TO MAKE A TECHNICAL CORRECTION; AND
5 DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.
6 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
7 SECTION 1. That Section 18-3302K, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
8 amended to read as follows:
9 18-3302K. ISSUANCE OF ENHANCED LICENSES TO CARRY CONCEALED
10 WEAPONS. (1) The sheriff of a county, on behalf of the state of Idaho, must,
11 within ninety (90) days after the filing of an application by any person
12 who is not disqualified from possessing or receiving a firearm under state
13 or federal law and has otherwise complied with the requirements of this
14 section, issue an enhanced license to the person to carry concealed weapons
15 on his person. Licenses issued under this section shall be valid for five (5)
16 years from the date of issue.
17 (2) The sheriff must make license applications readily available at the
18 office of the sheriff, at other public offices in his jurisdiction and on the
19 website of the Idaho state police. The license application must be in a form
20 to be prescribed by the director of the Idaho state police and must meet the
21 following requirements:
22 (a) The license application shall require the applicant's name, ad-
23 dress, description, signature, date of birth, place of birth, military
24 status, citizenship and the driver's license number or state identi-
25 fication card number if used for identification in applying for the
26 license. If the applicant is not a U.S. citizen, the application shall
27 also require any alien or admission number issued to the applicant by
28 U.S. immigration and customs enforcement, or any successor agency;
29 (b) The license application may ask the applicant to disclose his
30 social security number but must indicate that disclosure of the appli-
31 cant's social security number is optional; and
32 (c) The license application must contain a warning that substantially
33 reads as follows:
34 CAUTION: Federal law and state law on the possession of weapons and
35 firearms differ. If you are prohibited by federal law from possess-
36 ing a weapon or a firearm, you may be prosecuted in federal court. A
37 state permit is not a defense to a federal prosecution.
38 (3) Any person who is applying for original issuance of a license to
39 carry concealed weapons must submit his fingerprints with the completed
40 application. Within five (5) days after the filing of an application, the

2
1 sheriff must forward the applicant's completed license application and
2 fingerprints to the Idaho state police. The Idaho state police must con-
3 duct a national fingerprint-based records check, an inquiry through the
4 national instant criminal background check system, and a check of any ap-
5 plicable state database, including a check for any mental health records
6 for conditions or commitments that would disqualify a person from possess-
7 ing a firearm under state or federal law, and must return the results to the
8 sheriff within sixty (60) days. If the applicant is not a U.S. citizen, an
9 immigration alien query must also be conducted through U.S. immigration and
10 customs enforcement or any successor agency. The sheriff shall not issue a
11 license before receiving and reviewing the results of the records check.
12 (4) The sheriff must deny an enhanced license to carry a concealed
13 weapon if the applicant is disqualified under any of the criteria listed in
14 section 18-3302(11), Idaho Code, or does not meet all of the following qual-
15 ifications:
16 (a) Is over the age of twenty-one (21) years;
17 (b) Has been a legal resident of the state of Idaho for at least six (6)
18 consecutive months before filing an application under this section or
19 holds a current license or permit to carry concealed weapons issued by
20 his state of residence; and
21 (c) Has successfully completed, within the twelve (12) months immedi-
22 ately preceding filing an application, a qualifying handgun course as
23 specified in this paragraph and taught by a certified instructor who is
24 not prohibited from possessing firearms under state or federal law. A
25 copy of the certificate of successful completion of the handgun course,
26 in a form to be prescribed by the director of the Idaho state police and
27 signed by the course instructor, must be submitted to the sheriff at the
28 time of filing an application under this section. Certified instruc-
29 tors of handgun courses when filing an application under this section
30 shall not be required to submit such certificates but must submit a copy
31 of their current instructor's credential. The sheriff must accept as a
32 qualifying handgun course a personal protection course offered by the
33 national rifle association or an equivalent, provided that all personal
34 protection or equivalent courses must meet the following requirements:
35 (i) The course instructor is certified by the national rifle as-
36 sociation, or by another nationally recognized organization that
37 customarily certifies firearms instructors, as an instructor in
38 personal protection with handguns, or the course instructor is
39 certified by the Idaho peace officers standards and training coun-
40 cil as a firearms instructor;
41 (ii) The course is at least eight (8) hours in duration;
42 (iii) The course is taught face to face and not by electronic or
43 other means; and
44 (iv) The course includes instruction in:
45 1. Idaho law relating to firearms and the use of deadly
46 force, provided that such instruction is delivered by either
47 of the following whose name and credential must appear on the
48 certificate:
49 (A) An active, senior or emeritus member of the Idaho
50 state bar; or

3
1 (B) A law enforcement officer, active or retired, who
2 currently possesses or possessed at the time of his re-
3 tirement an intermediate or higher Idaho peace offi-
4 cers standards and training certificate;
5 2. The basic concepts of the safe and responsible use of
6 handguns;
7 3. Self-defense principles; and
8 4. Live fire training, including the firing of at least
9 ninety-eight (98) rounds by the student.
10 An instructor must provide a copy of the syllabus and a written descrip-
11 tion of the course of fire used in a qualifying handgun course that in-
12 cludes the name of the individual instructing the legal portion of the
13 course to the sheriff upon request.

25 hanced concealed weapons license" on its face.
26 (6) Upon issuing a license under the provisions of this section, the
27 sheriff must notify the Idaho state police within three (3) days on a form or
28 in a manner prescribed by the Idaho state police. Information relating to an
29 applicant or licensee received or maintained pursuant to this section by the
30 sheriff or Idaho state police is confidential and exempt from disclosure un-
31 der section 74-105, Idaho Code.
32 (7) The fee for original issuance of an enhanced license shall be twenty
33 dollars ($20.00), which the sheriff must retain for the purpose of perform-
34 ing the duties required in this section. The sheriff may collect the actual
35 cost of any additional fees necessary to cover the processing costs lawfully
36 required by any state or federal agency or department, as well as the actual
37 cost of materials for the license lawfully required by any state agency or
38 department, which costs must be paid to the state. The sheriff must provide
39 the applicant with a copy of the results of the fingerprint-based records
40 check upon request of the applicant.
41 (8) The fee for renewal of the enhanced license shall be fifteen dollars
42 ($15.00), which the sheriff must retain for the purpose of performing duties
43 required in this section. The sheriff may collect the actual cost of any ad-
44 ditional fees necessary to cover the processing costs lawfully required by

49 disqualified in this state shall be renewable at any time during the ninety
50 (90) day period before its expiration or within ninety (90) days after the

2 prior to the expiration date of the license. The sheriff shall require the
3 licensee applying for renewal to complete an application. The sheriff must
4 submit the application to the Idaho state police. The Idaho state police
5 must conduct the same records checks as required for an initial license
6 under subsection (3) of this section and must return the results to the sher-
7 iff within thirty (30) days. The sheriff shall not issue a renewal before
8 receiving and reviewing the results of the records check and must deny a
9 license if the applicant is disqualified under any of the criteria provided
10 in this section. A renewal license shall be valid for a period of five (5)
11 years. A license so renewed shall take effect on the expiration date of
12 the prior license. A licensee renewing ninety-one (91) days to one hundred
13 eighty (180) days after the expiration date of the license must pay a late re-
14 newal penalty of ten dollars ($10.00) in addition to the renewal fee, except
15 that any licensee serving on active duty in the armed forces of the United

27 modify or add to the requirements of this section, nor shall a city, county
28 or political subdivision ask the applicant to voluntarily submit any infor-
29 mation not required in this section. A civil action may be brought to enjoin
30 a wrongful refusal to issue a license or a wrongful modification of the re-
31 quirements of this section. The civil action may be brought in the county in
32 which the application was made or in Ada county at the discretion of the peti-
33 tioner. Any person who prevails against a public agency in any action in the
34 courts for a violation of this section must be awarded costs, including rea-
35 sonable attorney's fees, incurred in connection with the legal action.
36 (11) A county sheriff, deputy sheriff or county employee who issues a
37 license to carry a concealed weapon under this section shall not incur any
38 civil or criminal liability as the result of the performance of his or her du-
39 ties in compliance with this section.
40 (12) The sheriff shall have the power to revoke a license issued pur-
41 suant to this section subsequent to a hearing in accordance with the provi-

2 grounds for the denial of the license by the sheriff;
3 (d) The violation of any of the provisions of this section; or
4 (e) The applicant is adjudicated guilty of or receives a withheld judg-
5 ment for a crime that would have disqualified him from initially receiv-
6 ing a license.
7 (13) An applicant who provides information on the application for an
8 enhanced license to carry a concealed weapon knowing the same to be untrue
9 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
10 (14) The attorney general must contact the appropriate officials in
11 other states for the purpose of establishing, to the extent possible, recog-
12 nition and reciprocity of the enhanced license to carry a concealed weapon
13 by other states, whether by formal agreement or otherwise. The Idaho state
14 police or the attorney general must keep a copy and maintain a record of all
15 such agreements and reciprocity recognitions that must be made available to
16 the public.
17 (15) Any license issued pursuant to this section is valid throughout the
18 state of Idaho and shall be considered an authorized state license.

24 enforcement agency, whether inside or outside the state of Idaho, may access
25 the record system for the purpose of verifying current enhanced licensee
26 status.
