18 Idaho Code, are to be applied to the extent allowed in computing Idaho tax-
19 able income:
20 (a) Add any state and local taxes, as defined in section 164 of the In-
21 ternal Revenue Code that are measured by net income, or for which a credit is
22 allowable under section 63-3029, Idaho Code, and paid or accrued during the
23 taxable year adjusted for state or local tax refunds used in arriving at tax-
24 able income.
25 (b) Add the net operating loss deduction used in arriving at taxable in-
26 come.
27 (c)(1) A net operating loss for any taxable year commencing on and af-
28 ter January 1, 2000, but before January 1, 2013, shall be a net oper-
29 ating loss carryback not to exceed a total of one hundred thousand dol-
30 lars ($100,000) to the two (2) immediately preceding taxable years. At
31 the election of the taxpayer, the two (2) year carryback may be forgone
32 and the loss subtracted from income received in taxable years arising in
33 the next twenty (20) years succeeding the taxable year in which the loss
34 arises in order until exhausted.
35 (2) A net operating loss for any taxable year commencing on or after
36 January 1, 2013, shall be a net operating loss carryback not to exceed
37 a total of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) to the two (2) imme-
38 diately preceding taxable years only if an amended return carrying the
39 loss back is filed within one (1) year of the end of the taxable year of
40 the net operating loss that results in such carryback.
41 (3) Any portion of the net operating loss not subtracted from income in

3 amount of the net operating loss deduction incurred. The carryback
4 shall be limited to a total of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in the
5 case of an individual filing as married filing separate in the year of
6 the loss.

8 which such corporation did not transact business in Idaho or was not
9 included in a group of corporations combined under section 63-3027(22),

11 tion within a group of corporations combined under section 63-3027(22),
12 Idaho Code, was transacting business in Idaho during the taxable year

14 subtracted. Net operating losses incurred by a person, other than a
15 corporation, in activities not taxable by Idaho may not be subtracted.

10 tax purposes.
11 (r) Add the excess business losses under section 461(l) of the Internal
12 Revenue Code, as required by section 63-3004, Idaho Code. The excess busi-
13 ness losses may be carried forward and deducted as an Idaho net operating
14 loss under section 63-3021, Idaho Code, successively over the next twenty
15 (20) years succeeding the taxable year in which the loss arises until such
16 losses are exhausted. Excess business losses shall not be carried back.

38 taxable year, a tax measured by Idaho taxable income as defined in this chap-
39 ter is hereby imposed upon every individual, trust, or estate required by
40 this chapter to file a return.
41 (2)(a) The tax imposed upon individuals, trusts, and estates shall be
42 computed at the rate of five and six hundred ninety-five thousandths
43 percent (5.695%) five and three-tenths percent (5.3%) of taxable income
44 over two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500).
45 (b) For taxpayers filing a joint return pursuant to the provisions of
46 section 63-3031, Idaho Code, the tax imposed shall be computed at the
47 rate of five and six hundred ninety-five thousandths percent (5.695%)
48 five and three-tenths percent (5.3%) of taxable income over five thou-
49 sand dollars ($5,000). For the purposes of this section, a return of

7
1 a surviving spouse, as defined in section 2(a) of the Internal Revenue
2 Code, and a head of household, as defined in section 2(b) of the Internal
3 Revenue Code, shall be treated as a joint return.
4 (3) For taxable year 2000 and each year thereafter, the state tax com-
5 mission shall prescribe a factor that shall be used to compute the Idaho in-
6 come tax thresholds provided in subsection (2) of this section. The factor
7 shall provide an adjustment to the Idaho tax thresholds so that inflation
8 will not result in a tax increase. The Idaho tax thresholds shall be adjusted
9 as follows: multiply the last threshold amount by the percentage (the con-
10 sumer price index for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar
11 year to which the adjusted threshold amount will apply divided by the con-
12 sumer price index for calendar year 1998). For the purpose of this computa-
13 tion, the consumer price index for any calendar year is the average of the
14 consumer price index as of the close of the twelve (12) month period for the
15 immediately preceding calendar year, without regard to any subsequent ad-
16 justments, as adopted by the state tax commission. This adoption shall be
17 exempt from the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code. The consumer
18 price index shall mean the consumer price index for all U.S. urban consumers
19 published by the United States department of labor. The state tax commission
20 shall annually include the factor as provided in this subsection to multiply
21 against Idaho taxable income using the thresholds in this section to arrive
22 at that year's Idaho taxable income for tax threshold purposes.
23 (4) In the case of a trust that is an electing small business trust as
24 defined in section 1361 of the Internal Revenue Code, the special rules for
25 taxation of such trusts contained in section 641 of the Internal Revenue Code
26 shall apply, except that the individual rate provided in subsection (2)(a)
27 of this section shall apply in computing tax due under this chapter.
28 (5) The state tax commission may promulgate rules defining the condi-
29 tions upon which such returns shall be filed.
30 SECTION 4. That Section 63-3025, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
31 amended to read as follows:
32 63-3025. TAX ON CORPORATE INCOME. (1) For each taxable year, a tax
33 is hereby imposed on the Idaho taxable income of a corporation, other than
34 an S corporation, that transacts or is authorized to transact business in

36 to five and six hundred ninety-five thousandths percent (5.695%) five and
37 three-tenths percent (5.3%) of Idaho taxable income.
38 (2) In the case of an S corporation that is required to file a return un-
39 der section 63-3030, Idaho Code, a tax is hereby imposed at the rate provided
40 in subsection (1) of this section upon both:

42 amount of net recognized built-in gain attributable to this state shall
43 be computed in accordance with section 1374 of the Internal Revenue
44 Code subject to the apportionment and allocation provisions of section
45 63-3027, Idaho Code; and
46 (b) Excess net passive income attributable to this state. The amount of
47 excess net passive income attributable to this state shall be computed
48 in accordance with section 1375 of the Internal Revenue Code subject to

8
1 the apportionment and allocation provisions of section 63-3027, Idaho
2 Code.
3 (3) The tax imposed by subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall not be
4 less than twenty dollars ($20.00); provided that the twenty-dollar ($20.00)
5 minimum payment shall not be collected from nonproductive mining corpora-
6 tions.
7 (4) The tax imposed by this section shall not apply to corporations
8 taxed pursuant to the provisions of section 63-3025A, Idaho Code.
9 SECTION 5. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
10 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after its
11 passage and approval, and retroactively to January 1, 2025.
