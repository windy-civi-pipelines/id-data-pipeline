32 (14) Firefighter occupational diseases:
33 (a) As used in this subsection, "firefighter" means an employee whose
34 primary duty is that of extinguishing or investigating fires as part of
35 a fire district, fire department or fire brigade.
36 (b) If a firefighter is diagnosed with one (1) or more of the following
37 diseases after the period of employment indicated in subparagraphs (i)
38 through (xi) of this paragraph, and the disease was not revealed dur-
39 ing an initial employment medical screening examination that was per-
40 formed according to such standards and conditions as may be established
41 at the sole discretion of the governing board having authority over a
42 given fire district, fire department, or fire brigade, then the disease
43 shall be presumed to be proximately caused by the firefighter's employ-
44 ment as a firefighter:
45 (i) Brain cancer after ten (10) years;
46 (ii) Bladder cancer after twelve (12) years;
47 (iii) Kidney cancer after fifteen (15) years;
48 (iv) Colorectal cancer after ten (10) years;
49 (v) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after fifteen (15) years;
50 (vi) Leukemia after five (5) years;
11
1 (vii) Mesothelioma after ten (10) years;
2 (viii) Testicular cancer after five (5) years if diagnosed before
3 the age of forty (40) years with no evidence of anabolic steroids

9 (xi) Multiple myeloma after fifteen (15) years.
10 (c) The presumption created in this subsection may be overcome by sub-
11 stantial evidence to the contrary. If the presumption is overcome by
12 substantial evidence, then the firefighter or the beneficiaries must
13 prove that the firefighter's disease was caused by his or her duties of
14 employment.
15 (d) The presumption created in this subsection shall not preclude a
16 firefighter from demonstrating a causal connection between employment
17 and disease or injury by a preponderance of evidence before the Idaho
18 industrial commission.
19 (e) The presumption created in this subsection shall not apply to any
20 specified disease diagnosed more than ten (10) years following the last
21 date on which the firefighter actually worked as a firefighter as de-
22 fined in paragraph (a) of this subsection. Nor shall the presumption
23 apply if a firefighter or a firefighter's cohabitant has regularly and
24 habitually used tobacco products for ten (10) or more years prior to the
25 diagnosis.
26 (f) The periods of employment described in paragraph (b) of this sub-
27 section refer to periods of employment within the state of Idaho.
28 Recognizing that additional toxic or harmful substances or matter are
29 continually being discovered and used or misused, the above enumerated oc-
30 cupational diseases are not intended to be exclusive, but such additional
31 diseases shall not include hazards that are common to the public in general
32 and that are not within the meaning of section 72-102(21)(a) 72-102(22)(a),
33 Idaho Code, and the diseases enumerated in subsection (12) of this section
34 pertaining to firefighters shall not be subject to the limitations pre-
35 scribed in section 72-439, Idaho Code.
36 SECTION 5. That Section 72-451, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
37 amended to read as follows:
38 72-451. PSYCHOLOGICAL ACCIDENTS AND INJURIES. (1) Psychological in-
39 juries, disorders or conditions shall not be compensated under this title,
40 unless the following conditions are met:
41 (a) Such injuries of any kind or nature emanating from the workplace
42 shall be compensated only if caused by accident and physical injury
43 as defined in section 72-102(17)(a) through (17)(c), Idaho Code, or
44 only if accompanying an occupational disease with resultant physical
45 injury, except that a psychological mishap or event may constitute an

48 logical mishap or event meets the other criteria of this section;
12
1 (ii) It is readily recognized and identifiable as having occurred
2 in the workplace; and
3 (iii) It must be the product of a sudden and extraordinary event;

5 ditions generally inherent in every working situation or from a person-
6 nel-related action including, but not limited to, disciplinary action,
7 changes in duty, job evaluation or employment termination;
8 (c) Such accident and injury must be the predominant cause as compared
9 to all other causes combined of any consequence for which benefits are
10 claimed under this section;
11 (d) Where psychological causes or injuries are recognized by this sec-
12 tion, such causes or injuries must exist in a real and objective sense;
13 (e) Any permanent impairment or permanent disability for psychologi-
14 cal injury recognizable under the Idaho worker's compensation law must
15 be based on a condition sufficient to constitute a diagnosis using the
16 terminology and criteria of the American psychiatric association's di-
17 agnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, third edition re-
18 vised, or any successor manual promulgated by the American psychiatric
19 association, and must be made by a psychologist or psychiatrist duly li-
20 censed to practice in the jurisdiction in which treatment is rendered;
21 and
22 (f) Clear and convincing evidence that the psychological injuries
23 arose out of and in the course of the employment from an accident or oc-
24 cupational disease as contemplated in this section is required.
25 (2) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section shall be construed as
26 allowing compensation for psychological injuries from psychological causes
27 without accompanying physical injury.
28 (3) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall apply to ac-
29 cidents and injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1994, and to causes of ac-
30 tion for benefits accruing on or after July 1, 1994, notwithstanding that
31 the original worker's compensation claim may have occurred prior to July 1,
32 1994.
33 (4) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, post-traumatic
34 stress injury suffered by a first responder is a compensable injury or occu-
35 pational disease when the following conditions are met:
36 (a) The first responder is examined and subsequently diagnosed with
37 post-traumatic stress injury by a psychologist, a psychiatrist duly li-
38 censed to practice in the jurisdiction where treatment is rendered, or a
39 counselor trained in post-traumatic stress injury; and
40 (b) Clear and convincing evidence indicates that the post-traumatic
41 stress injury was caused by an event or events arising out of and in the
42 course of the first responder's employment.
43 (5) No compensation shall be paid for such injuries described in sub-
44 section (2) (4) of this section arising from a personnel-related action in-
45 cluding, but not limited to, disciplinary action, changes in duty, job eval-
46 uation, or employment termination.
47 (6) As used in subsection (4) of this section:
48 (a) "Post-traumatic stress injury" means a disorder that meets the di-
49 agnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder or post-traumatic
50 stress injury specified by the American psychiatric association's di-
13
1 agnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition re-
2 vised, or any successor manual promulgated by the American psychiatric
3 association.

14 medical services as adopted by the department of health and wel-
15 fare; and
16 (v) An emergency communications officer as defined in section

27 the course of, his employment.
28 (13) Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS-related com-
29 plexes (ARC), other manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

32 (14) Firefighter occupational diseases:
33 (a) As used in this subsection, "firefighter" means an employee whose
34 primary duty is that of extinguishing or investigating fires as part of
35 a fire district, fire department or fire brigade.
36 (b) If a firefighter is diagnosed with one (1) or more of the following
37 diseases after the period of employment indicated in subparagraphs (i)
38 through (xi) of this paragraph, and the disease was not revealed dur-
39 ing an initial employment medical screening examination that was per-
40 formed according to such standards and conditions as may be established
41 at the sole discretion of the governing board having authority over a
42 given fire district, fire department, or fire brigade, then the disease
43 shall be presumed to be proximately caused by the firefighter's employ-
44 ment as a firefighter:
45 (i) Brain cancer after ten (10) years;
46 (ii) Bladder cancer after twelve (12) years;
47 (iii) Kidney cancer after fifteen (15) years;
48 (iv) Colorectal cancer after ten (10) years;
49 (v) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after fifteen (15) years;
50 (vi) Leukemia after five (5) years;

11
1 (vii) Mesothelioma after ten (10) years;
2 (viii) Testicular cancer after five (5) years if diagnosed before
3 the age of forty (40) years with no evidence of anabolic steroids
4 or human growth hormone use;
5 (ix) Breast cancer after five (5) years if diagnosed before the
6 age of forty (40) years without a breast cancer 1 or breast cancer 2
7 genetic predisposition to breast cancer;
8 (x) Esophageal cancer after ten (10) years; and
9 (xi) Multiple myeloma after fifteen (15) years.
10 (c) The presumption created in this subsection may be overcome by sub-
11 stantial evidence to the contrary. If the presumption is overcome by
12 substantial evidence, then the firefighter or the beneficiaries must
13 prove that the firefighter's disease was caused by his or her duties of
14 employment.
15 (d) The presumption created in this subsection shall not preclude a
16 firefighter from demonstrating a causal connection between employment
17 and disease or injury by a preponderance of evidence before the Idaho
18 industrial commission.
19 (e) The presumption created in this subsection shall not apply to any
20 specified disease diagnosed more than ten (10) years following the last
21 date on which the firefighter actually worked as a firefighter as de-
22 fined in paragraph (a) of this subsection. Nor shall the presumption
23 apply if a firefighter or a firefighter's cohabitant has regularly and
24 habitually used tobacco products for ten (10) or more years prior to the
25 diagnosis.
26 (f) The periods of employment described in paragraph (b) of this sub-
27 section refer to periods of employment within the state of Idaho.
28 Recognizing that additional toxic or harmful substances or matter are
29 continually being discovered and used or misused, the above enumerated oc-
30 cupational diseases are not intended to be exclusive, but such additional
31 diseases shall not include hazards that are common to the public in general
32 and that are not within the meaning of section 72-102(21)(a) 72-102(22)(a),
33 Idaho Code, and the diseases enumerated in subsection (12) of this section
34 pertaining to firefighters shall not be subject to the limitations pre-
35 scribed in section 72-439, Idaho Code.
36 SECTION 5. That Section 72-451, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
37 amended to read as follows:
38 72-451. PSYCHOLOGICAL ACCIDENTS AND INJURIES. (1) Psychological in-
39 juries, disorders or conditions shall not be compensated under this title,
40 unless the following conditions are met:
41 (a) Such injuries of any kind or nature emanating from the workplace
42 shall be compensated only if caused by accident and physical injury
43 as defined in section 72-102(17)(a) through (17)(c), Idaho Code, or
44 only if accompanying an occupational disease with resultant physical
45 injury, except that a psychological mishap or event may constitute an
46 accident where:
47 (i) It results in resultant physical injury as long as the psycho-
48 logical mishap or event meets the other criteria of this section;

12
1 (ii) It is readily recognized and identifiable as having occurred
2 in the workplace; and
3 (iii) It must be the product of a sudden and extraordinary event;

5 ditions generally inherent in every working situation or from a person-
6 nel-related action including, but not limited to, disciplinary action,
7 changes in duty, job evaluation or employment termination;
8 (c) Such accident and injury must be the predominant cause as compared
9 to all other causes combined of any consequence for which benefits are
10 claimed under this section;
11 (d) Where psychological causes or injuries are recognized by this sec-
12 tion, such causes or injuries must exist in a real and objective sense;
13 (e) Any permanent impairment or permanent disability for psychologi-
14 cal injury recognizable under the Idaho worker's compensation law must
15 be based on a condition sufficient to constitute a diagnosis using the
16 terminology and criteria of the American psychiatric association's di-
17 agnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, third edition re-
18 vised, or any successor manual promulgated by the American psychiatric
19 association, and must be made by a psychologist or psychiatrist duly li-
20 censed to practice in the jurisdiction in which treatment is rendered;
21 and
22 (f) Clear and convincing evidence that the psychological injuries
23 arose out of and in the course of the employment from an accident or oc-
24 cupational disease as contemplated in this section is required.
25 (2) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section shall be construed as
26 allowing compensation for psychological injuries from psychological causes
27 without accompanying physical injury.
28 (3) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall apply to ac-
29 cidents and injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1994, and to causes of ac-
30 tion for benefits accruing on or after July 1, 1994, notwithstanding that
31 the original worker's compensation claim may have occurred prior to July 1,
32 1994.
33 (4) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, post-traumatic
34 stress injury suffered by a first responder is a compensable injury or occu-
35 pational disease when the following conditions are met:
36 (a) The first responder is examined and subsequently diagnosed with
37 post-traumatic stress injury by a psychologist, a psychiatrist duly li-
38 censed to practice in the jurisdiction where treatment is rendered, or a
39 counselor trained in post-traumatic stress injury; and
40 (b) Clear and convincing evidence indicates that the post-traumatic
41 stress injury was caused by an event or events arising out of and in the
42 course of the first responder's employment.
43 (5) No compensation shall be paid for such injuries described in sub-
44 section (2) (4) of this section arising from a personnel-related action in-
45 cluding, but not limited to, disciplinary action, changes in duty, job eval-
46 uation, or employment termination.
47 (6) As used in subsection (4) of this section:
48 (a) "Post-traumatic stress injury" means a disorder that meets the di-
49 agnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder or post-traumatic
50 stress injury specified by the American psychiatric association's di-

13
1 agnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition re-
2 vised, or any successor manual promulgated by the American psychiatric
3 association.
