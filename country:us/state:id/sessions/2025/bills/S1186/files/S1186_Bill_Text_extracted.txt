17 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
18 SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND FINDINGS. It is the intent of the Leg-
19 islature to identify and discourage quid pro quo corruption in fact as well
20 as diminish the appearance of quid pro quo corruption. The Legislature finds
21 that when a person or entity spends large sums of money either in support
22 of or opposition to a candidate and the identity of such person or entity is
23 opaque to the public, it is impossible for the public to know who is funding
24 such campaigns and to what degree those campaigns are funded by dark money
25 that is not tied to any named individual or business. The Legislature finds
26 that this knowledge is important to the public because in many cases the in-
27 dividuals funding such campaigns appear to do so with the specific purpose
28 of surreptitiously electing an official they believe they can control, ca-
29 jole, or threaten into voting in a manner that they wish, which leads to at
30 least an appearance of a quid pro quo relationship between the person elected
31 and those secretly funding the entities paying for electioneering campaigns
32 with dark money.
33 The Legislature further finds that a common belief among the populace
34 is that many elected officials are overly influenced, if not controlled, by
35 well-funded special interests. In order to dispel the appearance of quid pro
36 quo corruption when it may not exist and to better root it out where it does
37 exist, this legislation will allow members of the public, regulators, and
38 law enforcement officials to more clearly identify who is making the contri-
39 butions that have had such a large impact on election outcomes in Idaho in-
40 stead of continuing to allow wealthy players to hide behind a curtain of dark
41 money.
42 The Legislature further finds that innocent individuals and entities
43 are also often accused of financing dark money expenditures when they are
2
1 not. This leaves these individuals and organizations who are not partici-
2 pating in dark money expenditures in a position of being asked to prove a neg-
3 ative, which can be impossible due to the lack of transparency in campaign
4 finance reporting, and which contributes to the majority of the public be-
5 lieving corrupt practices are being employed and hidden.
6 The Legislature further finds that the appearance of such negative and
7 damaging relationships could be dispelled if members of the public are able
8 to know who all of the players are by disclosing all of the large contribu-
9 tors, which can, in turn, dispel the appearance of quid pro quo corruption
10 for many who are assumed to be, or are incorrectly accused of, participat-
11 ing in suspected quid pro quo relationships. If this legislation is enacted,
12 it can be clearly shown which individuals and entities are not contributing
13 significant amounts to the various entities engaging in electioneering cam-
14 paigns.
15 The Legislature further finds that unlike the federal judiciary,
16 Idaho's Supreme Court justices, appellate judges, and district court judges
17 are elected, and are therefore more susceptible to the appearance of quid pro
18 quo corruption than members of the federal judiciary as long as dark money
19 contributions are allowed in Idaho elections. In addition to other consid-
20 erations, this demonstrates a greater need for disclosure in Idaho than in
21 federal elections because the Idaho judiciary presides over quid pro quo
22 corruption cases when they occur in Idaho. However, as elected officials
23 themselves, members of the Idaho judiciary are just as susceptible to the
24 appearance of quid pro quo corruption by the public as any other elected of-
25 ficial. Reducing or eliminating the practice of dark money expenditures in
26 Idaho elections will help to dispel the public's perception of quid pro quo
27 corruption related to all elected officials, including elected members of
28 the judiciary who arguably have the greatest need for trust from the public,
29 as they are the final arbiters of alleged corruption by officials elected in
30 Idaho.
31 It is therefore the intent of the Legislature, in order to dispel the ap-
32 pearance of quid pro quo corruption when it may not exist, and to better root
33 it out where it does exist, to allow the public to see who has previously been
34 hiding behind the proverbial curtain of dark money contributions that have
35 such a large impact on elections and potentially the votes of those who are
36 elected.

14 TO PROVIDE A CORRECT CODE REFERENCE AND TO MAKE A TECHNICAL CORRECTION;
15 PROVIDING SEVERABILITY; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND PROVIDING AN
16 EFFECTIVE DATE.
17 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
18 SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND FINDINGS. It is the intent of the Leg-
19 islature to identify and discourage quid pro quo corruption in fact as well
20 as diminish the appearance of quid pro quo corruption. The Legislature finds
21 that when a person or entity spends large sums of money either in support
22 of or opposition to a candidate and the identity of such person or entity is
23 opaque to the public, it is impossible for the public to know who is funding
24 such campaigns and to what degree those campaigns are funded by dark money
25 that is not tied to any named individual or business. The Legislature finds
26 that this knowledge is important to the public because in many cases the in-
27 dividuals funding such campaigns appear to do so with the specific purpose
28 of surreptitiously electing an official they believe they can control, ca-
29 jole, or threaten into voting in a manner that they wish, which leads to at
30 least an appearance of a quid pro quo relationship between the person elected
31 and those secretly funding the entities paying for electioneering campaigns
32 with dark money.
33 The Legislature further finds that a common belief among the populace
34 is that many elected officials are overly influenced, if not controlled, by
35 well-funded special interests. In order to dispel the appearance of quid pro
36 quo corruption when it may not exist and to better root it out where it does
37 exist, this legislation will allow members of the public, regulators, and
38 law enforcement officials to more clearly identify who is making the contri-
39 butions that have had such a large impact on election outcomes in Idaho in-
40 stead of continuing to allow wealthy players to hide behind a curtain of dark
41 money.
42 The Legislature further finds that innocent individuals and entities
43 are also often accused of financing dark money expenditures when they are

2
1 not. This leaves these individuals and organizations who are not partici-
2 pating in dark money expenditures in a position of being asked to prove a neg-
3 ative, which can be impossible due to the lack of transparency in campaign
4 finance reporting, and which contributes to the majority of the public be-
5 lieving corrupt practices are being employed and hidden.
6 The Legislature further finds that the appearance of such negative and
7 damaging relationships could be dispelled if members of the public are able
8 to know who all of the players are by disclosing all of the large contribu-
9 tors, which can, in turn, dispel the appearance of quid pro quo corruption
10 for many who are assumed to be, or are incorrectly accused of, participat-
11 ing in suspected quid pro quo relationships. If this legislation is enacted,
12 it can be clearly shown which individuals and entities are not contributing
13 significant amounts to the various entities engaging in electioneering cam-
14 paigns.
15 The Legislature further finds that unlike the federal judiciary,
16 Idaho's Supreme Court justices, appellate judges, and district court judges
17 are elected, and are therefore more susceptible to the appearance of quid pro
18 quo corruption than members of the federal judiciary as long as dark money
19 contributions are allowed in Idaho elections. In addition to other consid-
20 erations, this demonstrates a greater need for disclosure in Idaho than in
21 federal elections because the Idaho judiciary presides over quid pro quo
22 corruption cases when they occur in Idaho. However, as elected officials
23 themselves, members of the Idaho judiciary are just as susceptible to the
24 appearance of quid pro quo corruption by the public as any other elected of-
25 ficial. Reducing or eliminating the practice of dark money expenditures in
26 Idaho elections will help to dispel the public's perception of quid pro quo
27 corruption related to all elected officials, including elected members of
28 the judiciary who arguably have the greatest need for trust from the public,
29 as they are the final arbiters of alleged corruption by officials elected in
30 Idaho.
31 It is therefore the intent of the Legislature, in order to dispel the ap-
32 pearance of quid pro quo corruption when it may not exist, and to better root
33 it out where it does exist, to allow the public to see who has previously been
34 hiding behind the proverbial curtain of dark money contributions that have
35 such a large impact on elections and potentially the votes of those who are
36 elected.
37 SECTION 2. That Section 67-6602, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
38 amended to read as follows:

6 didate in the subsequent election for his or her office until the in-
7 cumbent has failed to file a declaration of candidacy by the statutory
8 deadline.
9 (2) (3) "Compensation" includes any advance, conveyance, forgiveness
10 of indebtedness, deposit, distribution, loan, payment, gift, pledge or

13 foregoing, for services rendered or to be rendered, but does not include

15 actually expended for such expenses and is substantiated by an itemization
16 of such expenses.
17 (3) (4) "Contractor" means a person who receives compensation from an-
18 other person for either full-time or part-time work based on a contract or
19 compensation agreement, but who is not an employee of that person.

21 of indebtedness, deposit, distribution, loan, payment, gift, pledge, sub-
