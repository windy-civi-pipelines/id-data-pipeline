2 program compensation rung cell amounts shall be adjusted by an amount equiv-
3 alent to the salary-based apportionment adjustment for administrative and
4 classified staff positions.

7 with fidelity to the state framework for teaching evaluation, including
8 each domain and identification of which domain or domains the administrator
9 is focusing on for the instructional staff or pupil service staff member
10 being evaluated, as outlined in administrative rule. The review shall be
11 completed prior to November 1 of each year. The state board of education
12 shall randomly select a sample of administrators throughout the state. A
13 portion of such administrators' instructional staff and pupil service staff
14 employee evaluations shall be independently reviewed. The ratio of in-
15 structional staff evaluations to pupil service staff evaluations shall be
16 equal to the ratio of the statewide instructional staff salary allowance to

18 input from the Idaho-approved teacher preparation programs and the state
19 department of education, shall identify individuals and a process to conduct
20 the reviews. Administrator certificate holders shall be required to par-
21 ticipate in ongoing evaluation training pursuant to section 33-1204, Idaho
22 Code. The state board of education shall report annually the findings of
23 such reviews to the senate education committee, the house of representatives
24 education committee, the state board of education and the deans of Idaho's
25 approved teacher preparation programs. The state board of education shall
26 promulgate rules implementing the provisions of this subsection.
27 (12) School districts shall submit annually to the state the data nec-
28 essary to determine if an instructional staff or pupil service staff member
29 has met the performance criteria for movement on the applicable compensation
30 rung. Such data shall include the individuals' performance on each of the
31 performance criteria as defined in section 33-1001, Idaho Code, including
32 the percentage of students meeting their measurable student achievement and
33 student success indicator targets. The department of education shall calcu-
34 late whether or not instructional staff and pupil service staff have met the
35 compensation rung performance criteria based on the data submitted during
36 the previous five (5) years. Individually identifiable performance evalu-
37 ation ratings submitted to the state remain part of the employee's person-
38 nel record and are exempt from public disclosure pursuant to section 74-106,
39 Idaho Code.
40 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
41 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
