45 may be evaluated by the authorizer;
46 (b) No more than one-third (1/3) of the public charter school's board
47 membership may be comprised of nonprofit educational services provider

26 (h) Charter holders must ensure that their facility contracts are sepa-
27 rate from management contracts; and
28 (i) All contracts and any subsequent amendments thereto between a vir-

31 that contracts with an educational services provider shall, annually,
32 provide its authorizer with proof of Idaho residency for all students
33 and audited financial statements demonstrating lawful expenditure
34 of all state and federal funds. All eligible expenses, materials,
35 products, technology devices, and other related services, including
36 internet service, that may be provided or made available by the educa-
37 tional services provider shall be included in the contract and approved
38 by the public charter school's governing board. Any related payments
39 or reimbursements shall be processed by the virtual school. Neither
40 a virtual school nor an educational services provider under contract
41 with a virtual school shall furnish payment directly to parents or legal
42 guardians of an enrolled student for items or services not approved by
43 the public charter school governing board, except in exchange for goods
44 or property sold or leased by the parent or legal guardian to the school
45 or educational services provider or for a service performed by the
46 parent or legal guardian as an employee or contractor of the school or
47 educational services provider. A virtual school shall be deemed finan-
48 cially sufficient if there is an agreement that requires an educational
49 services provider to assume the virtual school's financial risk when it
50 does not have sufficient residual funds to pay the educational services
7
1 provider. Where this paragraph is applicable, the educational services
2 provider shall make its audited financial statements available, unless
3 the educational services provider already makes such audited financial
4 statements publicly available for compliance with other federal or
5 state laws. Upon recommendation by the authorizer, the state depart-
6 ment of education may deduct amounts related to noncompliance with the
7 provisions of this subsection from subsequent years' public education
8 support program appropriations.
9 (9) Admission procedures, including provision for over-enrollment,
10 shall provide that the initial admission procedures for a public charter
11 school will be determined by lottery or other random method, except as oth-
12 erwise provided in this section. A charter holder shall strive to ensure
13 that citizens in the primary attendance area are made aware of the enrollment
14 opportunities and deadline. The public notice must include the enrollment
15 deadline, the public charter school's total enrollment capacity for the next
16 school year, and an advisory that all prospective students will be given
17 the opportunity to enroll in the public charter school regardless of race,
18 color, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, socioeconomic status,
19 or special needs.
20 (a) If initial capacity is insufficient to enroll all pupils who submit
21 a timely application, then the admission procedures may provide that
22 preference shall be given in the following order: first, to children
23 of founders, provided that this admission preference shall be limited
24 to not more than ten percent (10%) of the capacity of the public charter
25 school; second, to siblings of pupils already selected by the lottery
26 or other random method; third, to pupils seeking to transfer from an-
27 other Idaho public charter school or authorizer at which they have been
28 enrolled for at least one (1) year, provided that this admission prefer-
29 ence shall be subject to an existing written agreement for such prefer-
30 ence between the subject charter schools or authorizer; fourth, to stu-
31 dents residing within the primary attendance area of the public charter
32 school; and fifth, by an equitable selection process such as a lottery
33 or other random method. A public charter school may weight the school's
34 lottery to preference admission for the following educationally dis-
35 advantaged students: students living at or below one hundred eighty-
36 five percent (185%) of the federal poverty level, students who are home-
37 less or in foster care, children with disabilities as defined in sec-
38 tion 33-2001, Idaho Code, students with limited English proficiency,
39 and students who are at-risk as defined in section 33-1001, Idaho Code.
40 A public charter school may include the children of full-time employees
41 of the public charter school within the first priority group, subject to
42 the limitations therein.
43 (b) If capacity is insufficient to enroll all pupils who submit a timely
44 application for subsequent school terms, then the admission procedures
45 may provide that preference shall be given in the following order:
46 first, to pupils returning to the public charter school in the second
47 or any subsequent year of its operation; and then as provided in para-
48 graph (a) of this subsection. The sibling preference in subsequent
49 school years applies to siblings of a returning pupil and of a pupil
50 selected by the lottery or other random method. A new lottery shall be
8
1 conducted each year to fill vacancies that become available. A public
2 charter school may weight the school's lottery to preference admission
3 as provided in this paragraph and paragraph (a) of this subsection and
4 for children who attended the public charter school within the previous
5 three (3) school years but withdrew as a result of the relocation of a
6 parent or guardian due to an academic sabbatical or an employer or mili-
7 tary transfer or reassignment.
8 (c) Each public charter school shall establish a process under which a
9 child may apply for enrollment or register for courses, regardless of
10 where such child resides at the time of application or registration, if
11 the child is a dependent of a member of the United States armed forces
12 who has received transfer orders to a location in Idaho and will, upon
13 such transfer, reside in an area served by the public charter school.
14 If capacity is insufficient as described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this
15 subsection, a child described in this paragraph shall be treated as a
16 student residing within the primary attendance area of the public char-
17 ter school for purposes of preference. Otherwise, such children shall
18 be included in the highest priority group for which they would otherwise
19 be eligible.
20 (d) Admission to a public charter school shall be determined by a selec-
21 tion process held within seven (7) days of the enrollment deadlines es-
22 tablished by the charter holder. The selection process must take place
23 in a public setting, the date and time of which must be noticed to the
24 public at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance.
25 (e) Within seven (7) days after conducting the selection process, the
26 charter holder shall send an offer to the legal guardian who submitted a
27 written request for admission on behalf of a student notifying such per-
28 son that the student has been selected for admission to the public char-
29 ter school. An offer must be signed by such student's parent or guardian
30 and returned to the public charter school by the date designated in such
31 offer letter. Remaining students shall be notified that they may be el-
32 igible for admission at a later date if a seat becomes available.
33 (f) If a school exceeds its projected student count in a lottery and
34 a sufficient wait list exists, the school may increase enrollment by
35 adding additional students per grade, not to exceed the total amount of
36 students authorized by the charter.
37 SECTION 5. That Section 33-5207, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
38 amended to read as follows:
39 33-5207. PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL FINANCIAL SUPPORT. (1) Except as oth-
40 erwise provided for in this section, the state department of education shall
41 make the following apportionment to each charter school for each fiscal year
42 based on attendance figures submitted in a manner and time as required by the
43 state department of education.
44 (2) Per student support. Computation of support units for each public
45 charter school shall be calculated as if it were a separate school accord-
46 ing to the schedules in section 33-1002(4), Idaho Code, except that public
47 charter schools with fewer than one hundred (100) secondary ADA shall use a
48 divisor of twelve (12) and the minimum units shall not apply. No public char-
49 ter school shall receive an increase in support units that exceeds the sup-
9
1 port units it received in the prior year by more than forty (40), except in
2 cases of state-declared emergencies that have been approved by the autho-
3 rizer as having an impact on public education. Funding from the state educa-
4 tional support program shall be equal to the total distribution factor, plus
5 the salary-based apportionment provided in chapter 10, title 33, Idaho Code.
6 Provided, however, any public charter school that is formed by the conver-
7 sion of an existing traditional public school shall be assigned divisors,
8 pursuant to section 33-1002, Idaho Code, that are no lower than the divisors
9 of the school district in which the traditional public school is located, for
10 each category of pupils listed.
11 (3) Special education. For each student enrolled in the public char-
12 ter school who is entitled to special education services, the public charter
13 school shall receive the state and federal funds from the exceptional child
14 education program for that student that would have been apportioned to the
15 school district in which the public charter school is located.
16 (4) Alternative school support. Public charter schools may qualify
17 under the provisions of sections 33-1002 and 33-1002C, Idaho Code, provided
18 the public charter school meets the necessary statutory requirements and
19 students qualify for attendance at an alternative school as provided by rule
20 of the state board of education.
21 (5) Transportation support. Support shall be paid to the public char-
22 ter school as provided in chapter 15, title 33, Idaho Code, and section
23 33-1006, Idaho Code. Each public charter school shall furnish the depart-
24 ment with an enrollment count as of the first Friday in November of public
25 charter school students who are eligible for reimbursement of transporta-
26 tion costs under the provisions of this subsection and who reside more than
27 one and one-half (1 1/2) miles from the school. The state department of edu-
28 cation is authorized to include in the annual appropriation to the charter
29 school sixty percent (60%) of the estimated transportation cost. The final
30 appropriation payment in July shall reflect reimbursements of actual costs
31 pursuant to section 33-1006, Idaho Code. To be eligible for state reimburse-
32 ment under the provisions of section 33-1006, Idaho Code, the student to be
33 transported must reside within the public charter school's primary atten-
34 dance area and must meet at least one (1) of the following criteria:
35 (a) The student resides within the school district in which the public
36 charter school is physically located; or
37 (b) The student resides within fifteen (15) miles by road of the public
38 charter school. The limitations placed by this subsection on the reim-
39 bursement of transportation costs for certain students shall not apply
40 to public virtual schools.
41 (6) Facilities funds.
42 (a) The state department of education shall distribute facilities
43 funds to public charter schools for each student in which a majority
44 of the student's instruction is received at a physical facility that
45 is owned or leased by the public charter school. Such funds shall be
46 used to defray the costs associated with payments for real property used
47 by the students or employees of the public charter school for educa-
48 tional or administrative purposes. Such funds shall be distributed at
49 four hundred dollars ($400) per attending student pursuant to section
50 33-1003A, Idaho Code. In fiscal year 2027 and each fiscal year there-
10
1 after, the four hundred dollars ($400) per attending student shall be
2 adjusted by a percentage equal to the percent change in discretionary
3 funding per support unit included in the public education support
4 program for that fiscal year; provided, however, that the attending
5 student amount shall not be decreased to less than four hundred dol-
6 lars ($400) per attending student. For the purposes of this paragraph,
7 beginning in state fiscal year 2025, "attending student" means each
8 student in average daily attendance in kindergarten through grade 12 at
9 such physical charter school facilities where the student is enrolled;
10 except that, upon formal approval by the state board of education, a
11 charter school may receive an exemption to the physical facility re-
12 quirement pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph if the student
13 would have attended a physical facility if not for a stated emergency.
14 (b) For those public charter schools that do not receive facilities
15 funds for all enrolled students, the school may submit to the state
16 department of education a reimbursement claim for any costs for which
17 facilities funds may be used. The state department of education shall
18 reduce such claim by the greater of fifty percent (50%) or the percent-
19 age of the school's enrolled students for which the school receives
20 facilities funds and shall pay the balance. Provided, however, that the
21 total reimbursements paid to a public charter school, in combination
22 with any facilities stipend received by the school, shall not exceed the
23 amount of facilities funds that would have been received by the school
24 had the school received facilities funds for all students in average
25 daily attendance pursuant to section 33-1003A, Idaho Code. For the
26 purposes of this subsection, the term "real property" shall be used as
27 defined in section 63-201, Idaho Code. A virtual public charter school
28 authorized by the public charter school commission or authorized by a
29 public school district on or after March 1, 2024, shall not be eligible
30 for funds appropriated pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
31 (7) Payment schedule. The state department of education is authorized
32 to make an advance payment of twenty-five percent (25%) of a public charter
33 school's estimated annual apportionment for its first year of operation,
34 and each year thereafter, provided the public charter school is serving more
35 grades or at least ten percent (10%) more classes than the previous year, to
36 assist the school with initial start-up costs or payroll obligations. For
37 a public charter school entering at least its second year of operation, the
38 state department of education may require documentation establishing the
39 need for such an advance payment, including comparative class schedules and
40 proof of a commensurate increase in the number of employees.
41 (a) For a public charter school to receive the advance payment, the
42 school shall submit its anticipated fall membership for each grade
43 level to the state department of education by June 1.
44 (b) Using the figures provided by the public charter school, the state
45 department of education shall determine an estimated annual apportion-
46 ment from which the amount of the advance payment shall be calculated.
47 Advance payment shall be made to the school on or after July 1 but no
48 later than July 31.
49 (c) All subsequent payments, taking into account the onetime advance
50 payment made for the first year of operation, shall be made to the public
11
1 charter school in the same manner as other traditional public schools in
2 accordance with the provisions of section 33-1009, Idaho Code. A public
3 charter school shall comply with all applicable fiscal requirements of
4 law, except that the following provisions shall not be applicable to
5 public charter schools: that portion of section 33-1004, Idaho Code,
6 relating to reduction of the administrative and instructional staff
7 allowance and the pupil service staff allowance when there is a dis-
8 crepancy between the number allowed and the number actually employed;
9 and section 33-1004E, Idaho Code, for calculation of district staff
10 indices.
11 (8) If an authorizer has reason to believe that a public charter school
12 cannot remain fiscally sound for the remainder of its certificate term, it
13 shall provide the state department of education with written notification of
14 such concern. Upon receiving such notification, the state department of ed-
15 ucation shall have the authority to modify the percentage of the total appro-
16 priation to be paid to the public charter school pursuant to the provisions
17 of section 33-1009 1., Idaho Code, such that equal percentages are paid on
18 each of the prescribed dates.
19 (9) Each public charter school shall pay an authorizer fee to its autho-
20 rizer, not to initially exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), or, in the
21 case of existing charter schools, up to a five-percent (5%) increase of the
22 previous year's fee exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). Autho-
23 rizers shall annually set the authorizer's fee and in doing so shall document
24 the fees to actual expenditures associated with authorizing.
25 (10) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a public charter school from:
26 (a) Applying for federal grant moneys or for career technical education
27 funding of any source; or
28 (b) Receiving funding or other financial assistance for the establish-
29 ment or operation of a public charter school from any private person or
30 organization.
31 (11) Each student in attendance at a public virtual school shall be
32 funded based on either the actual hours of attendance in the public virtual
33 school on a flexible schedule or the percentage of coursework completed,
34 whichever is more advantageous to the school, up to the maximum of one (1)
35 full-time equivalent student.
36 (12) All federal educational funds shall be administered and dis-
37 tributed to public charter schools, including public virtual schools, that
38 have been designated as a local education agency (LEA), as provided in sec-
39 tion 33-5203, Idaho Code.
40 (13) Nothing in this section prohibits separate face-to-face learning
41 activities or services. In order to be eligible for career technical educa-
42 tion essential components funding, virtual schools may be required to offer
43 some face-to-face instruction in order to meet industry standards, licens-
44 ing requirements, work-based learning requirements, or other requirements
45 set forth by law.
46 (14) The provisions of section 33-1021, Idaho Code, shall apply to pub-
47 lic charter schools provided for in this chapter.
48 SECTION 6. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
49 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
50 July 1, 2025.

9 (2)(a) The authorizer must receive an application no later than Septem-
10 ber 1 for a new public charter school to be eligible to begin instruc-
11 tion the first complete school year following receipt of the applica-
12 tion, unless the authorizer agrees to a later date; and
13 (b) To begin operations, a newly chartered public school must be autho-
14 rized by no later than January 1 of the previous school year, unless the
15 authorizer agrees to a later date.
16 (3) Any authorizer may approve a public charter school formed by creat-
17 ing a new public charter school or by replicating an existing public charter
18 school. Converting an existing traditional public school to a public char-
19 ter school may only be approved only by the board of trustees of the school
20 district in which the existing public school is located.
21 (4) No charter shall be approved under this chapter:
22 (a) That provides for the conversion of any existing private or
23 parochial school to a public charter school;
24 (b) For a for-profit entity; provided, however, nothing in this section
25 shall prevent the board of directors of a public charter school from
26 legally contracting with an educational service provider that provides
27 comprehensive educational administrative and management services or
28 with for-profit entities for the provision of products or services that
29 aid in the operation of the school; or
30 (c) By the board of trustees of a school district if the public charter
31 school's physical location is outside the boundaries of the authorizing
32 school district.
33 (5) On and after July 1, 2026, a virtual school shall not be authorized
34 by any entity except the public charter school commission. Beginning on and
35 after July 1, 2025, any virtual schools that were authorized by an entity
36 other than the commission shall apply to transfer authorization to the com-
37 mission in accordance with the application process provided for in section
38 33-5205, Idaho Code.
39 (5) (6) A charter holder may not operate enterprises unrelated to the
40 educational purposes for which the public charter school has been autho-
41 rized. In cases of related enterprises, including but not limited to daycare
42 and after-school programs, no state education funding authorized pursuant
43 to this chapter may be used to subsidize such related enterprises.
44 (6) (7)(a) Each authorized public charter school is hereby designated
45 as a local education agency (LEA) as such term is defined in 34 CFR
46 300.28, unless the charter holder and authorizer agree that:
47 (i) Public charter schools authorized by the board of trustees of
48 a school district may be included in that district's LEA; or
49 (ii) Entities with multiple charters may operate as a single LEA.

4
1 (b) Notice of an agreement pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection
2 must be provided to the state department of education by no later than
3 February 1 of the proceeding preceding school year.

5
1 sight by the professional standards commission. Certificates may be revoked
2 pursuant to the provisions of section 33-1208, Idaho Code. Issuance of a

35 cate, a charter school may substitute its own ongoing education and pro-
36 fessional development requirements in place of those set forth in rule
37 by the state board of education if the same number of credit hours is
38 required as that of teachers holding a standard instructional certifi-
39 cate.
40 (8) Public charter schools may contract with educational services
41 providers subject to the following provisions:
42 (a) Educational services providers shall be third-party entities sepa-
43 rate from the public charter schools with which they contract and shall
44 not be considered governmental entities, provided that such contracts
45 may be evaluated by the authorizer;
46 (b) No more than one-third (1/3) of the public charter school's board
47 membership may be comprised of nonprofit educational services provider
48 representatives. Nonprofit educational services provider repre-
49 sentatives may not be employees of the public charter school or the
50 educational services provider and may not hold office as president or

6
1 treasurer on the public charter school's board. For-profit educational
2 services providers may not have representatives on the public charter
3 school's board of directors;
4 (c) Charter holders shall annually disclose any existing and potential
5 conflicts of interest, pecuniary or otherwise, with affiliated educa-
6 tional services providers;
7 (d) Charter holders shall retain accountability for academic, fiscal,
8 and organizational operations and outcomes of the school and may not re-
9 linquish this responsibility to any other entity;
10 (e) Contracts must ensure that school boards retain the right to termi-
11 nate the contract for failure to meet defined performance standards af-
12 ter notice and a reasonable cure period has expired and if material de-
13 ficiencies have not been cured prior to that time period expiring;
14 (f) Contracts must ensure that assets purchased by educational ser-
15 vices providers on behalf of the school, using public funds, shall
16 remain assets of the school. The provisions of this paragraph shall
17 not prevent educational services providers from acquiring assets using
18 revenue acquired through management fees;
19 (g) Charter holders shall consult legal counsel independent of the
20 party with whom they are contracting for purposes of reviewing the
21 school's management contract and facility lease or purchase agreements
22 to ensure compliance with applicable state and federal law, including
23 requirements that state entities not enter into contracts that obligate
24 them beyond the terms of any appropriation of funds by the state legis-
25 lature;
26 (h) Charter holders must ensure that their facility contracts are sepa-
27 rate from management contracts; and
28 (i) All contracts and any subsequent amendments thereto between a vir-
29 tual school and an educational services provider shall be approved by
30 the virtual school's authorizer prior to execution. A virtual school
31 that contracts with an educational services provider shall, annually,
32 provide its authorizer with proof of Idaho residency for all students
33 and audited financial statements demonstrating lawful expenditure
34 of all state and federal funds. All eligible expenses, materials,
35 products, technology devices, and other related services, including
36 internet service, that may be provided or made available by the educa-
37 tional services provider shall be included in the contract and approved
38 by the public charter school's governing board. Any related payments
39 or reimbursements shall be processed by the virtual school. Neither
40 a virtual school nor an educational services provider under contract
41 with a virtual school shall furnish payment directly to parents or legal
42 guardians of an enrolled student for items or services not approved by
43 the public charter school governing board, except in exchange for goods
44 or property sold or leased by the parent or legal guardian to the school
45 or educational services provider or for a service performed by the
46 parent or legal guardian as an employee or contractor of the school or
47 educational services provider. A virtual school shall be deemed finan-
48 cially sufficient if there is an agreement that requires an educational
49 services provider to assume the virtual school's financial risk when it
50 does not have sufficient residual funds to pay the educational services

7
1 provider. Where this paragraph is applicable, the educational services
2 provider shall make its audited financial statements available, unless
3 the educational services provider already makes such audited financial
4 statements publicly available for compliance with other federal or
5 state laws. Upon recommendation by the authorizer, the state depart-
6 ment of education may deduct amounts related to noncompliance with the
7 provisions of this subsection from subsequent years' public education
8 support program appropriations.
9 (9) Admission procedures, including provision for over-enrollment,
10 shall provide that the initial admission procedures for a public charter
11 school will be determined by lottery or other random method, except as oth-
12 erwise provided in this section. A charter holder shall strive to ensure
13 that citizens in the primary attendance area are made aware of the enrollment
14 opportunities and deadline. The public notice must include the enrollment
15 deadline, the public charter school's total enrollment capacity for the next
16 school year, and an advisory that all prospective students will be given
17 the opportunity to enroll in the public charter school regardless of race,
18 color, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, socioeconomic status,
19 or special needs.
20 (a) If initial capacity is insufficient to enroll all pupils who submit
21 a timely application, then the admission procedures may provide that
22 preference shall be given in the following order: first, to children
23 of founders, provided that this admission preference shall be limited
24 to not more than ten percent (10%) of the capacity of the public charter
25 school; second, to siblings of pupils already selected by the lottery
26 or other random method; third, to pupils seeking to transfer from an-
27 other Idaho public charter school or authorizer at which they have been
28 enrolled for at least one (1) year, provided that this admission prefer-
29 ence shall be subject to an existing written agreement for such prefer-
30 ence between the subject charter schools or authorizer; fourth, to stu-
31 dents residing within the primary attendance area of the public charter
32 school; and fifth, by an equitable selection process such as a lottery
33 or other random method. A public charter school may weight the school's
34 lottery to preference admission for the following educationally dis-
35 advantaged students: students living at or below one hundred eighty-
36 five percent (185%) of the federal poverty level, students who are home-
37 less or in foster care, children with disabilities as defined in sec-
38 tion 33-2001, Idaho Code, students with limited English proficiency,
39 and students who are at-risk as defined in section 33-1001, Idaho Code.
40 A public charter school may include the children of full-time employees
41 of the public charter school within the first priority group, subject to
42 the limitations therein.
43 (b) If capacity is insufficient to enroll all pupils who submit a timely
44 application for subsequent school terms, then the admission procedures
45 may provide that preference shall be given in the following order:
46 first, to pupils returning to the public charter school in the second
47 or any subsequent year of its operation; and then as provided in para-
48 graph (a) of this subsection. The sibling preference in subsequent
49 school years applies to siblings of a returning pupil and of a pupil
50 selected by the lottery or other random method. A new lottery shall be

8
1 conducted each year to fill vacancies that become available. A public
2 charter school may weight the school's lottery to preference admission
3 as provided in this paragraph and paragraph (a) of this subsection and
4 for children who attended the public charter school within the previous
5 three (3) school years but withdrew as a result of the relocation of a
6 parent or guardian due to an academic sabbatical or an employer or mili-
7 tary transfer or reassignment.
8 (c) Each public charter school shall establish a process under which a
9 child may apply for enrollment or register for courses, regardless of
10 where such child resides at the time of application or registration, if
11 the child is a dependent of a member of the United States armed forces
12 who has received transfer orders to a location in Idaho and will, upon
13 such transfer, reside in an area served by the public charter school.
14 If capacity is insufficient as described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this
15 subsection, a child described in this paragraph shall be treated as a
16 student residing within the primary attendance area of the public char-
17 ter school for purposes of preference. Otherwise, such children shall
18 be included in the highest priority group for which they would otherwise
19 be eligible.
20 (d) Admission to a public charter school shall be determined by a selec-
21 tion process held within seven (7) days of the enrollment deadlines es-
22 tablished by the charter holder. The selection process must take place
23 in a public setting, the date and time of which must be noticed to the
24 public at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance.
25 (e) Within seven (7) days after conducting the selection process, the
26 charter holder shall send an offer to the legal guardian who submitted a
27 written request for admission on behalf of a student notifying such per-
28 son that the student has been selected for admission to the public char-
29 ter school. An offer must be signed by such student's parent or guardian
30 and returned to the public charter school by the date designated in such
31 offer letter. Remaining students shall be notified that they may be el-
32 igible for admission at a later date if a seat becomes available.
33 (f) If a school exceeds its projected student count in a lottery and
34 a sufficient wait list exists, the school may increase enrollment by
35 adding additional students per grade, not to exceed the total amount of
36 students authorized by the charter.
37 SECTION 5. That Section 33-5207, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
38 amended to read as follows:
39 33-5207. PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL FINANCIAL SUPPORT. (1) Except as oth-
40 erwise provided for in this section, the state department of education shall
41 make the following apportionment to each charter school for each fiscal year
42 based on attendance figures submitted in a manner and time as required by the
43 state department of education.
44 (2) Per student support. Computation of support units for each public
45 charter school shall be calculated as if it were a separate school accord-
46 ing to the schedules in section 33-1002(4), Idaho Code, except that public
47 charter schools with fewer than one hundred (100) secondary ADA shall use a
48 divisor of twelve (12) and the minimum units shall not apply. No public char-
49 ter school shall receive an increase in support units that exceeds the sup-

9
1 port units it received in the prior year by more than forty (40), except in
2 cases of state-declared emergencies that have been approved by the autho-
3 rizer as having an impact on public education. Funding from the state educa-
4 tional support program shall be equal to the total distribution factor, plus
5 the salary-based apportionment provided in chapter 10, title 33, Idaho Code.
6 Provided, however, any public charter school that is formed by the conver-
7 sion of an existing traditional public school shall be assigned divisors,
8 pursuant to section 33-1002, Idaho Code, that are no lower than the divisors
9 of the school district in which the traditional public school is located, for
10 each category of pupils listed.
11 (3) Special education. For each student enrolled in the public char-
12 ter school who is entitled to special education services, the public charter
13 school shall receive the state and federal funds from the exceptional child
14 education program for that student that would have been apportioned to the
15 school district in which the public charter school is located.
16 (4) Alternative school support. Public charter schools may qualify
17 under the provisions of sections 33-1002 and 33-1002C, Idaho Code, provided
18 the public charter school meets the necessary statutory requirements and
19 students qualify for attendance at an alternative school as provided by rule
20 of the state board of education.
21 (5) Transportation support. Support shall be paid to the public char-
22 ter school as provided in chapter 15, title 33, Idaho Code, and section
23 33-1006, Idaho Code. Each public charter school shall furnish the depart-
24 ment with an enrollment count as of the first Friday in November of public
25 charter school students who are eligible for reimbursement of transporta-
26 tion costs under the provisions of this subsection and who reside more than
27 one and one-half (1 1/2) miles from the school. The state department of edu-
28 cation is authorized to include in the annual appropriation to the charter
29 school sixty percent (60%) of the estimated transportation cost. The final
30 appropriation payment in July shall reflect reimbursements of actual costs
31 pursuant to section 33-1006, Idaho Code. To be eligible for state reimburse-
32 ment under the provisions of section 33-1006, Idaho Code, the student to be
33 transported must reside within the public charter school's primary atten-
34 dance area and must meet at least one (1) of the following criteria:
35 (a) The student resides within the school district in which the public
36 charter school is physically located; or
37 (b) The student resides within fifteen (15) miles by road of the public
38 charter school. The limitations placed by this subsection on the reim-
39 bursement of transportation costs for certain students shall not apply
40 to public virtual schools.
41 (6) Facilities funds.
42 (a) The state department of education shall distribute facilities
43 funds to public charter schools for each student in which a majority
44 of the student's instruction is received at a physical facility that
45 is owned or leased by the public charter school. Such funds shall be
46 used to defray the costs associated with payments for real property used
47 by the students or employees of the public charter school for educa-
48 tional or administrative purposes. Such funds shall be distributed at
49 four hundred dollars ($400) per attending student pursuant to section
50 33-1003A, Idaho Code. In fiscal year 2027 and each fiscal year there-

10
1 after, the four hundred dollars ($400) per attending student shall be
2 adjusted by a percentage equal to the percent change in discretionary
3 funding per support unit included in the public education support
4 program for that fiscal year; provided, however, that the attending
5 student amount shall not be decreased to less than four hundred dol-
6 lars ($400) per attending student. For the purposes of this paragraph,
7 beginning in state fiscal year 2025, "attending student" means each
8 student in average daily attendance in kindergarten through grade 12 at
9 such physical charter school facilities where the student is enrolled;
10 except that, upon formal approval by the state board of education, a
11 charter school may receive an exemption to the physical facility re-
12 quirement pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph if the student
13 would have attended a physical facility if not for a stated emergency.
14 (b) For those public charter schools that do not receive facilities
15 funds for all enrolled students, the school may submit to the state
16 department of education a reimbursement claim for any costs for which
17 facilities funds may be used. The state department of education shall
18 reduce such claim by the greater of fifty percent (50%) or the percent-
19 age of the school's enrolled students for which the school receives
20 facilities funds and shall pay the balance. Provided, however, that the
21 total reimbursements paid to a public charter school, in combination
22 with any facilities stipend received by the school, shall not exceed the
23 amount of facilities funds that would have been received by the school
24 had the school received facilities funds for all students in average
25 daily attendance pursuant to section 33-1003A, Idaho Code. For the
26 purposes of this subsection, the term "real property" shall be used as
27 defined in section 63-201, Idaho Code. A virtual public charter school
28 authorized by the public charter school commission or authorized by a
29 public school district on or after March 1, 2024, shall not be eligible
30 for funds appropriated pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
31 (7) Payment schedule. The state department of education is authorized
32 to make an advance payment of twenty-five percent (25%) of a public charter
33 school's estimated annual apportionment for its first year of operation,
34 and each year thereafter, provided the public charter school is serving more
35 grades or at least ten percent (10%) more classes than the previous year, to
36 assist the school with initial start-up costs or payroll obligations. For
37 a public charter school entering at least its second year of operation, the
38 state department of education may require documentation establishing the
39 need for such an advance payment, including comparative class schedules and
40 proof of a commensurate increase in the number of employees.
41 (a) For a public charter school to receive the advance payment, the
42 school shall submit its anticipated fall membership for each grade
43 level to the state department of education by June 1.
44 (b) Using the figures provided by the public charter school, the state
45 department of education shall determine an estimated annual apportion-
46 ment from which the amount of the advance payment shall be calculated.
47 Advance payment shall be made to the school on or after July 1 but no
48 later than July 31.
49 (c) All subsequent payments, taking into account the onetime advance
50 payment made for the first year of operation, shall be made to the public

11
1 charter school in the same manner as other traditional public schools in
2 accordance with the provisions of section 33-1009, Idaho Code. A public
3 charter school shall comply with all applicable fiscal requirements of
4 law, except that the following provisions shall not be applicable to
5 public charter schools: that portion of section 33-1004, Idaho Code,
6 relating to reduction of the administrative and instructional staff
7 allowance and the pupil service staff allowance when there is a dis-
8 crepancy between the number allowed and the number actually employed;
9 and section 33-1004E, Idaho Code, for calculation of district staff
10 indices.
11 (8) If an authorizer has reason to believe that a public charter school
12 cannot remain fiscally sound for the remainder of its certificate term, it
13 shall provide the state department of education with written notification of
14 such concern. Upon receiving such notification, the state department of ed-
15 ucation shall have the authority to modify the percentage of the total appro-
16 priation to be paid to the public charter school pursuant to the provisions
17 of section 33-1009 1., Idaho Code, such that equal percentages are paid on
18 each of the prescribed dates.
19 (9) Each public charter school shall pay an authorizer fee to its autho-
20 rizer, not to initially exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), or, in the
21 case of existing charter schools, up to a five-percent (5%) increase of the
22 previous year's fee exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). Autho-
23 rizers shall annually set the authorizer's fee and in doing so shall document
24 the fees to actual expenditures associated with authorizing.
25 (10) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a public charter school from:
26 (a) Applying for federal grant moneys or for career technical education
27 funding of any source; or
28 (b) Receiving funding or other financial assistance for the establish-
29 ment or operation of a public charter school from any private person or
30 organization.
31 (11) Each student in attendance at a public virtual school shall be
32 funded based on either the actual hours of attendance in the public virtual
33 school on a flexible schedule or the percentage of coursework completed,
34 whichever is more advantageous to the school, up to the maximum of one (1)
35 full-time equivalent student.
36 (12) All federal educational funds shall be administered and dis-
37 tributed to public charter schools, including public virtual schools, that
38 have been designated as a local education agency (LEA), as provided in sec-
39 tion 33-5203, Idaho Code.
40 (13) Nothing in this section prohibits separate face-to-face learning
41 activities or services. In order to be eligible for career technical educa-
42 tion essential components funding, virtual schools may be required to offer
43 some face-to-face instruction in order to meet industry standards, licens-
44 ing requirements, work-based learning requirements, or other requirements
45 set forth by law.
46 (14) The provisions of section 33-1021, Idaho Code, shall apply to pub-
47 lic charter schools provided for in this chapter.
48 SECTION 6. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
