18 reelection to public office and who has taken any of the following actions:
19 (a) Announced the individual's candidacy publicly;
20 (b) Filed for public office;
21 (c) Received a contribution for the purpose of promoting the individ-
22 ual's candidacy for office; or
23 (d) Made an expenditure, contracted for services, or reserved space
24 with the intent of promoting the individual's candidacy for office.
25 For purposes of this chapter, an incumbent shall be presumed to be a can-
26 didate in the subsequent election for his or her office until the in-
27 cumbent has failed to file a declaration of candidacy by the statutory
28 deadline.
29 (2) "Compensation" includes any advance, conveyance, forgiveness of
30 indebtedness, deposit, distribution, loan, payment, gift, pledge or trans-
31 fer of money or anything of value, and any contract, agreement, promise or
32 other obligation, whether or not legally enforceable, to do any of the fore-
33 going, for services rendered or to be rendered, but does not include reim-
34 bursement of expenses if such reimbursement does not exceed the amount ac-
35 tually expended for such expenses and is substantiated by an itemization of
36 such expenses.
37 (3) "Contractor" means a person who receives compensation from another
38 person for either full-time or part-time work based on a contract or compen-
39 sation agreement, but who is not an employee of that person.

41 of indebtedness, deposit, distribution, loan, payment, gift, pledge, sub-
42 scription or transfer of money or anything of value, and any contract, agree-
