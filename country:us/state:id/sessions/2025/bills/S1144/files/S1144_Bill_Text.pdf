23 cases.
24 (3) Existing or new pedestrian and bicycle facilities may only be im-

26 necessary to improve the safety of pedestrian and bicycle facilities near
27 schools, parks, or other designated pedestrian or bicycle areas.
28 (4) For a highway functioning as a non-residential collector or arte-
29 rial highway, commissioners may only increase the width, straighten, or re-
30 locate the highway, except as required by federal law. Commissioners shall
31 not decrease the width of any non-residential collector or arterial highway,
32 unless required by federal law.
33 (5) If, in the laying out, widening, or straightening of any highway it
34 becomes necessary to take private property, the commissioners or their di-
35 rector of highways shall cause a survey of the proposed highway to be made,
36 together with an accurate description of the lands required. The commis-
37 sioners shall endeavor to agree with each owner for the purchase of a right-
38 of-way over the owner's land included within the description. If they are
39 able to agree with the owner, the commissioners may purchase the land out of
40 the county highway fund under their control, and the land shall then be con-
