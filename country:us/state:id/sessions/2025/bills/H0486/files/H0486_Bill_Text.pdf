18 44-2701. DEFINITIONS. As used in this chapter:
19 (1) "Adjudication" means litigation, arbitration, and mediation.
20 (2) "Covenant not to compete" means:
21 (a) Every written or oral covenant, agreement, or contract between an
22 employee or independent contractor and an employer or contractor that,
23 following termination of the employment or contract, restricts the em-
24 ployee or independent contractor from engaging in a lawful profession,
25 trade, or business of any kind:
26 (i) For another employer for a specified period of time;
27 (ii) In a specified geographical area; or
28 (iii) For another employer in a capacity that is similar to the em-
29 ployee's work for the employer that is party to the agreement;
30 (b) An agreement that directly or indirectly prohibits the acceptance
31 or transaction of business with a customer; or
32 (c) Any provision in an agreement that threatens, demands, requires,
33 or otherwise effectuates that an individual return, repay, or forfeit
34 any right, benefit, or compensation as a consequence of the individual
35 engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind.
36 (d) "Covenant not to compete" does not include:
37 (i) A nondisclosure agreement or agreement designed to protect
38 trade secrets or confidential information; or
39 (ii) A non-solicitation agreement or agreement restricting the
40 ability to use client or contact lists or solicit customers of the
41 employer.

2
1 (3) "Employer" means any individual, partnership, association, corpo-
2 ration, business, trust, or any person or group of persons acting directly or
3 indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee or an in-
4 dependent contractor.
5 (4) "Employee" means any individual who performs services for an em-
6 ployer, including an independent contractor.
7 (5) "Independent contractor" means any individual whose employment is
8 governed by a contract and whose compensation is not reported to the inter-
9 nal revenue service on a W-2 form. For purposes of this section, independent
10 contractor also includes any corporation, limited liability corporation,
11 partnership, or other corporate entity when an employer requires an individ-
12 ual to form such an organization for purposes of entering into a contract for
13 services as a condition of receiving compensation under an independent con-
14 tractor agreement.
15 44-2702. COVENANTS NOT TO COMPETE ARE VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE. Except
16 as otherwise provided for in this chapter, a covenant not to compete con-
17 tained in a contract or agreement is void and unenforceable.
18 44-2703. EXCEPTIONS. Notwithstanding the provisions of section
19 44-2702, Idaho Code, a covenant not to compete is valid and enforceable if:
20 (1) The covenant not to compete is agreed on during the sale of a busi-
21 ness. The person selling the business and the partners, members, or share-
22 holders and the buyer of the business may agree on a temporary and geographi-
23 cally restricted covenant not to compete that will prohibit the seller of the
24 business from carrying on a similar business within a reasonable geographic
25 area and for a reasonable length of time;
26 (2) The covenant not to compete is agreed on in anticipation of the dis-
27 solution of a business. The partners, members, or shareholders, upon or in
28 anticipation of a dissolution of a partnership, limited liability company,
29 or corporation, may agree that all or any number of the parties will not carry
30 on a similar business within a reasonable geographic area where the business
31 has been transacted; or
32 (3) The covenant not to compete covers an employee who earns two hundred
33 fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) or more per year.
34 44-2704. CHOICE OF LAW -- VENUE. (1) An employer shall not require an
35 employee who primarily resides and works in Idaho, as a condition of employ-
36 ment, to agree to a provision in an agreement or contract that would do either
37 of the following:
38 (a) Require the employee to adjudicate outside of Idaho a claim arising
39 in Idaho; or
40 (b) Deprive the employee of the substantive protection of Idaho law
41 with respect to a controversy arising in Idaho.
42 (2) Any provision of a contract or agreement that violates this section
43 is voidable at any time by the employee and, if a provision is rendered void
44 at the request of the employee, the matter shall be adjudicated in Idaho and
45 Idaho law shall govern such dispute.

3
1 44-2705. ENFORCEABILITY -- ATTORNEY'S FEES. (1) Nothing in this chap-
2 ter shall be construed to render void or unenforceable any other provisions
3 in a contract or agreement containing a void or unenforceable covenant not to
4 compete.
5 (2) In addition to injunctive relief and any other remedies as may be
6 provided by law, a court may award reasonable attorney's fees to an employee
7 or independent contractor who prevails in enforcing his rights under this
8 chapter.
9 SECTION 3. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
10 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
11 July 1, 2025.
