45 tion is to encourage the use of surface water for irrigation. All appli-
46 cants proposing to make land use changes shall be required to use surface wa-
47 ter, where reasonably available, as the primary water source for irrigation.
48 Surface water shall be deemed reasonably available if:
11
1 (a) A surface water right is, or reasonably can be made, appurtenant to
2 the land;
3 (b) The land is entitled to distribution of surface water from an irri-
4 gation district, canal company, ditch users association, or other irri-
5 gation delivery entity, and the entity's distribution system is capable
6 of delivering the water to the land; or
7 (c) An irrigation district, canal company, or other irrigation deliv-
8 ery entity has sufficient available surface water rights to apportion
9 or allocate to the land and has a distribution system capable of deliv-
10 ering the water to the land.

12 in the nature of use of surface water provided by an irrigation delivery
13 entity must be authorized by the entity holding the water right(s) for the
14 available surface water. Nothing in this section shall alter the authority
15 and discretion of irrigation delivery entities to apportion, allocate and
16 distribute surface water, or for municipalities, counties, or water and
17 sewer districts to pass ordinances or regulations to promote the use of sur-
18 face water for irrigation.
19 (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to override or amend any
20 provision of title 42 or 43, Idaho Code, or impair any rights acquired there-
21 under.
22 (4) When considering amending, repealing or adopting a comprehensive
23 plan, the local governing board shall consider the effect the proposed
24 amendment, repeal or adoption of the comprehensive plan would have on the

22 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
23 SECTION 1. That Section 42-111, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
24 amended to read as follows:
25 42-111. DOMESTIC PURPOSES DEFINED. (1) For purposes of sections
26 42-221, 42-227, 42-230, 42-235, 42-237a, 42-242, 42-243, and 42-1401A,
27 Idaho Code, the :
28 (a) The phrase "domestic purposes" or "domestic uses" means:
29 (a) (i) The use of water for homes, organization camps, public
30 campgrounds, livestock, and for any other purpose in connection
31 therewith, including irrigation of up to one-half (1/2) acre of
32 land, if the total use is not in excess of does not exceed thirteen
33 thousand (13,000) gallons per day,; or
34 (b) (ii) Any other uses, The use of water for any other purpose,
35 if the total use does not exceed a diversion rate of four one-hun-
36 dredths (0.04) cubic feet per second and a diversion volume of
37 twenty-five hundred (2,500) gallons per day volume of two and
38 eight-tenths (2.8) acre feet per year.
39 (2) For purposes of the sections listed in subsection (1) of this sec-
40 tion, domestic purposes or domestic uses shall not include water for multi-
41 ple ownership subdivisions, mobile home parks, or commercial or business es-

2
1 tablishments, unless the use meets the diversion rate and volume limitations
2 set forth in subsection (1)(b) of this section.
3 (b) "Domestic purposes" or "domestic uses" shall not include water for
4 the following purposes, unless the use meets the diversion rate and vol-
5 ume limitations set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection:
6 (i) Mobile home parks or recreational vehicle parks;
7 (ii) Apartments, condominiums, and similar developments with
8 multiple dwelling units;
9 (iii) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, subdi-
10 visions, as defined in chapter 13, title 50, Idaho Code; or
11 (iv) Commercial or business establishments or mixed-use estab-
12 lishments where the water is used primarily for commercial or
13 business purposes.
14 (3) (2) Multiple Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section,
15 multiple water rights for domestic uses or domestic purposes, as defined in
16 this section, shall not be established or exercised in a manner to satisfy
17 a single combined water use or purpose that would not itself come within the
18 definition of a domestic use or purpose under this section. The purpose of
19 this limitation is to prohibit the diversion and use of water, under a combi-
20 nation of domestic purposes or domestic uses as defined in this section, to
21 provide a supply of water for a use that does not meet the exemption of sec-
22 tion 42-227, Idaho Code, and is required to comply with the mandatory appli-
23 cation and permit process for developing a right to the use of water pursuant
24 to chapter 2, title 42, Idaho Code.
25 (3) Multiple water rights for domestic purposes or uses may be estab-
26 lished and exercised from the same point or points of diversion if the use
27 is limited to residential, in-home use. This subsection does not affect any
28 other permitting requirement or other requirement that may apply to the use
29 of water within a subdivision. For the purposes of this section, the term
30 "in-home use" means the utilization of water within a residence or house-
31 hold, including all activities that require water, such as drinking, cook-
32 ing, bathing, and cleaning within and around the household. It does not in-
33 clude irrigation of lawns, gardens, landscaping, pastures, or other open
34 spaces.
35 SECTION 2. That Section 42-227, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
36 amended to read as follows:
37 42-227. DRILLING AND USE OF WELLS FOR DOMESTIC PURPOSES EXCEPTED. (1)
38 The Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, excavation and
39 opening of wells and the withdrawal of water therefrom for domestic purposes
40 or uses as defined in section 42-111, Idaho Code, shall not be subject to the
41 permit requirements under section 42-229, Idaho Code; providing such wells
42 and withdrawal devices are subject to inspection by the department of water
43 resources and the department of environmental quality and providing further
44 that the drilling of such wells shall be subject to the licensing provisions
45 of section 42-238, Idaho Code. Rights to ground water for such domestic pur-
46 poses may be acquired by withdrawal and use.
47 (2) Wells and withdrawal devices for domestic purposes or uses shall be
48 subject to inspection by the department of water resources and the depart-
49 ment of environmental quality.

3
1 (3) Well drillers shall be licensed pursuant to the licensing provi-
2 sions of section 42-238, Idaho Code.
3 (4) For purposes of new diversions within subdivisions, as defined in
4 chapter 13, title 50, Idaho Code, in any area where the director of the de-
5 partment of water resources has issued a moratorium order on the develop-
6 ment of new water rights or has designated a critical ground water area or
7 ground water management area, an application for permit, pursuant to section
8 42-229, Idaho Code, shall be required for the diversion of water for any new
9 domestic purposes or uses, as defined in section 42-111, Idaho Code, other
10 than for in-home uses, as defined in section 42-111, Idaho Code, or watering
11 livestock.

47 ter, where reasonably available, as the primary water source for irrigation.

11
1 (a) A surface water right is, or reasonably can be made, appurtenant to
2 the land;
3 (b) The land is entitled to distribution of surface water from an irri-
4 gation district, canal company, ditch users association, or other irri-
5 gation delivery entity, and the entity's distribution system is capable
6 of delivering the water to the land; or
7 (c) An irrigation district, canal company, or other irrigation deliv-

12 in the nature of use of surface water provided by an irrigation delivery
13 entity must be authorized by the entity holding the water right(s) for the
14 available surface water. Nothing in this section shall alter the authority
15 and discretion of irrigation delivery entities to apportion, allocate and
16 distribute surface water, or for municipalities, counties, or water and
17 sewer districts to pass ordinances or regulations to promote the use of sur-
18 face water for irrigation.
19 (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to override or amend any
20 provision of title 42 or 43, Idaho Code, or impair any rights acquired there-
21 under.
22 (4) When considering amending, repealing or adopting a comprehensive
