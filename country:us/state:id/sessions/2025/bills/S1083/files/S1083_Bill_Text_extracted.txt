39 67-6537. USE OF SURFACE AND GROUND WATER. (1) The intent of this sec-
40 tion is to encourage the use of surface water for irrigation. All appli-
41 cants proposing to make land use changes shall be required to use surface wa-
42 ter, where reasonably available, as the primary water source for irrigation.
43 Surface water shall be deemed reasonably available if:
44 (a) A surface water right is, or reasonably can be made, appurtenant to
45 the land;
46 (b) The land is entitled to distribution of surface water from an irri-
47 gation district, canal company, ditch users association, or other irri-
48 gation delivery entity, and the entity's distribution system is capable
49 of delivering the water to the land; or
11
1 (c) An irrigation district, canal company, or other irrigation deliv-
2 ery entity has sufficient available surface water rights to apportion
3 or allocate to the land and has a distribution system capable of deliv-
4 ering the water to the land.
5 (2) Consistent with sections 42-108 and 42-222, Idaho Code, any change
6 in the nature of use of surface water provided by an irrigation delivery
7 entity must be authorized by the entity holding the water right(s) for the
8 available surface water. Nothing in this section shall alter the authority
9 and discretion of irrigation delivery entities to apportion, allocate and
10 distribute surface water, or for municipalities, counties, or water and
11 sewer districts to pass ordinances or regulations to promote the use of sur-
12 face water for irrigation.
13 (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to override or amend any
14 provision of title 42 or 43, Idaho Code, or impair any rights acquired there-
15 under.
16 (4) When considering amending, repealing or adopting a comprehensive
17 plan, the local governing board shall consider the effect the proposed
18 amendment, repeal or adoption of the comprehensive plan would have on the
19 source, quantity and quality of ground water in the area.
20 SECTION 12. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
21 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
22 July 1, 2025.

23 SECTION 1. That Section 42-111, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
24 amended to read as follows:
25 42-111. DOMESTIC PURPOSES DEFINED. (1) For purposes of sections
26 42-221, 42-227, 42-230, 42-235, 42-237a, 42-242, 42-243, and 42-1401A,
27 Idaho Code, the :
28 (a) The phrase "domestic purposes" or "domestic uses" means:
29 (a) (i) The use of water for homes, organization camps, public
30 campgrounds, livestock, and for any other purpose in connection
31 therewith, including irrigation of up to one-half (1/2) acre of
32 land, if the total use is not in excess of does not exceed thirteen
33 thousand (13,000) gallons per day,; or
34 (b) (ii) Any other uses, The use of water for any other purpose,
35 if the total use does not exceed a diversion rate of four one-hun-

38 eight-tenths (2.8) acre feet per year.
39 (2) For purposes of the sections listed in subsection (1) of this sec-
40 tion, domestic purposes or domestic uses shall not include water for multi-
41 ple ownership subdivisions, mobile home parks, or commercial or business es-

2 set forth in subsection (1)(b) of this section.
3 (b) "Domestic purposes" or "domestic uses" shall not include water for
4 the following purposes, unless the use meets the diversion rate and vol-
5 ume limitations set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection:

38 and withdrawal devices are subject to inspection by the department of water
39 resources and the department of environmental quality and providing further
40 that the drilling of such wells shall be subject to the licensing provisions
41 of section 42-238, Idaho Code. Rights to ground water for such domestic pur-
42 poses may be acquired by withdrawal and use.
43 (2) Wells and withdrawal devices for domestic purposes or uses shall be
44 subject to inspection by the department of water resources and the depart-
45 ment of environmental quality.
46 (3) Well drillers shall be licensed pursuant to the licensing provi-
47 sions of section 42-238, Idaho Code.
48 (4) For purposes of new diversions within subdivisions, as defined in
49 chapter 13, title 50, Idaho Code, in any area where the director of the de-

3

2 ment of new water rights or has designated a critical ground water area or
3 ground water management area, an application for permit, pursuant to section
4 42-229, Idaho Code, shall be required for the diversion of water for any new
5 domestic purposes or uses, as defined in section 42-111, Idaho Code, other
6 than for in-home uses or watering livestock.

40 tion is to encourage the use of surface water for irrigation. All appli-
41 cants proposing to make land use changes shall be required to use surface wa-
42 ter, where reasonably available, as the primary water source for irrigation.

44 (a) A surface water right is, or reasonably can be made, appurtenant to
45 the land;
46 (b) The land is entitled to distribution of surface water from an irri-
47 gation district, canal company, ditch users association, or other irri-
48 gation delivery entity, and the entity's distribution system is capable
49 of delivering the water to the land; or

11

2 ery entity has sufficient available surface water rights to apportion
3 or allocate to the land and has a distribution system capable of deliv-
4 ering the water to the land.

6 in the nature of use of surface water provided by an irrigation delivery
7 entity must be authorized by the entity holding the water right(s) for the
8 available surface water. Nothing in this section shall alter the authority
9 and discretion of irrigation delivery entities to apportion, allocate and
10 distribute surface water, or for municipalities, counties, or water and
11 sewer districts to pass ordinances or regulations to promote the use of sur-
12 face water for irrigation.
13 (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to override or amend any
14 provision of title 42 or 43, Idaho Code, or impair any rights acquired there-
15 under.
16 (4) When considering amending, repealing or adopting a comprehensive
17 plan, the local governing board shall consider the effect the proposed
18 amendment, repeal or adoption of the comprehensive plan would have on the
19 source, quantity and quality of ground water in the area.
