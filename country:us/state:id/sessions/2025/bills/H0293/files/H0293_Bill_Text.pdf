17 SECTION 1. That Section 33-1006, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
18 amended to read as follows:
19 33-1006. TRANSPORTATION SUPPORT PROGRAM. (1) The state board of ed-
20 ucation shall determine what costs of transporting pupils, including main-
21 tenance, operation and depreciation of basic vehicles, insurance, payments
22 under contract with other public transportation providers whose vehicles
23 used to transport pupils comply with federal transit administration regula-
24 tions, "bus testing," 49 CFR part 665, and any revision thereto, as provided
25 in subsection (4)(d) of this section, or other state department of educa-
26 tion-approved private transportation providers, salaries of drivers, and
27 any other costs, shall be allowable in computing the transportation support
28 program of school districts authorized transportation operations.
29 (2) Any costs associated with the addition of vehicle features that are
30 not part of the basic vehicle shall not be allowable in computing the trans-
31 portation support program of school districts an authorized transportation
32 operation. A basic vehicle is hereby defined as the cost of the vehicle with-
33 out optional features, plus the addition of essential safety features and
34 features necessary for the transportation of pupils with disabilities.
35 (3) Each school district authorized transportation operation shall
36 maintain records and make reports as are required for the purposes of this
37 section.
38 (4) The transportation support program of a school district an autho-
39 rized transportation operation shall be based upon the allowable costs of:
40 (a) Transporting public school pupils one and one-half (1 1/2) miles or
41 more to school;

2
1 (b) Transporting pupils less than one and one-half (1 1/2) miles as pro-
2 vided in section 33-1501, Idaho Code, when approved by the state board
3 of education;
4 (c) Payments when transportation is not furnished, as provided in sec-
5 tion 33-1503, Idaho Code;
6 (d) The transportation program for grades 6-12 kindergarten through
7 grade 12, upon the costs of payments pursuant to a contract with other
8 public or private transportation providers entered into as provided
9 in section 33-1510, Idaho Code, if the school district authorized
10 transportation operation establishes that the reimbursable costs of
11 transportation under the contract are equal to or less than the costs
12 for school buses;
13 (e) The employer's share of contributions to the public employee re-
14 tirement system and to social security; and
15 (f) Providing transportation to and from approved school activities as
16 may be approved by the rules of the state board of education.
17 (5) The state's share of the transportation support program shall
18 be fifty percent (50%) eighty-five percent (85%) of reimbursable trans-
19 portation costs of the district incurred by the authorized transportation
20 operation during the immediately preceding state fiscal year, except for
21 the cost of state department of education training and fee assessments
22 and bus depreciation and maintenance, for which the state's share shall be
23 eighty-five percent (85%) of such costs that the cost of any item identified
24 as ineligible by the state department of education shall not be reimbursed.
25 For school districts that contract for pupil transportation services, the
26 The state's share for authorized transportation operations that contract
27 for pupil transportation services shall be the average state share of costs
28 for district-run operations, based on the statewide total of such costs.
29 Provided however, that the reimbursable costs for any school district shall
30 not exceed one hundred three percent (103%) of the statewide average reim-
31 bursable cost per mile or the state statewide average reimbursable cost per
32 student rider, whichever is more advantageous to the school district. If a
33 school district's costs exceed the one hundred three percent (103%) limit
34 when computed by the more advantageous of the two (2) methods, that school
35 district shall be reimbursed at the appropriate percentage designated by
36 this subsection, multiplied by the maximum limit for whichever method is
37 more favorable to the school district. A school district An authorized
38 transportation operation may appeal the application of the one hundred three
39 percent (103%) limit on reimbursable costs to the state board of education,
40 which may establish for that district authorized transportation operation a
41 new percentile limit for reimbursable costs compared to the statewide aver-
42 age, which is higher than one hundred three percent (103%). In doing so, the
43 state board of education may set a new limit that is greater than one hundred
44 three percent (103%), but is less than the percentile limit requested by the
45 school district authorized transportation operation. However, the percent-
46 age increase in the one hundred three percent (103%) cap shall not exceed the
47 percentage of the district's bus runs that qualify as a hardship bus run,
48 pursuant to this subsection. Any costs above the new level established by
49 the state board of education shall not be reimbursed. Such a change shall
50 only be granted by the state board of education for hardship bus runs. To

3
1 qualify as a hardship bus run, such bus run shall meet at least two (2) of the
2 following criteria:
3 (a) The number of student riders per mile is less than fifty percent
4 (50%) of the statewide average number of student riders per mile;
5 (b) Less than a majority of the miles on the bus run are by paved sur-
6 face, concrete or asphalt road;
7 (c) Over ten percent (10%) of the miles driven on the bus run are a five
8 percent (5%) slope or greater.
9 (6) Beginning on July 1, 2005, any eligible home-based public virtual
10 school may claim transportation reimbursement for the prior fiscal year's
11 cost of providing educational services to students. In order to be eligible,
12 such a school shall have at least one (1) average daily attendance divisor,
13 pursuant to section 33-1002, Idaho Code, that is greater than the median
14 divisor shown for any category of pupils, among the actual divisors listed.
15 For the purposes of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this subsection (6), "ed-
16 ucation provider" means the home-based public virtual school or an entity
17 that has legally contracted with the home-based public virtual school to
18 supply education services. Reimbursable costs shall be limited to the costs
19 of:
20 (a) Providing an internet connection service between the student and
21 the education provider, not including the cost of telephone service;
22 (b) Providing electronic and computer equipment used by the student
23 to transmit educational material between the student and the education
24 provider;
25 (c) Providing a toll-free telephone service for students to communi-
26 cate with the education provider;
27 (d) Providing education-related, face-to-face visits by representa-
28 tives of the home-based public virtual school, with such reimbursements
29 limited to the mileage costs set for state employee travel by the state
30 board of examiners; and
31 (e) Any actual pupil transportation costs that would be reimbursable if
32 claimed by a school district.
33 The total reimbursement for such home-based public virtual schools shall be
34 exempt from the statewide average cost per mile limitations of this section.
35 The state's share of reimbursable costs shall be eighty-five percent (85%),
36 subject to the statewide cost per student rider provisions of this section.
37 For the purposes of such home-based public virtual school, the number of stu-
38 dent riders shall be the same as the number of pupils in average daily atten-
39 dance.
40 (7) The state department of education shall calculate the amount of
41 state funds lost in fiscal year 2010 by each school district as a result
42 of the decrease in the state reimbursement from eighty-five percent (85%)
43 to fifty percent (50%) of certain eligible costs, including the reduction
44 calculated for districts that contract for pupil transportation services,
45 and excluding any reductions made due to the limitation on reimbursable
46 expenses, all pursuant to subsection (5) of this section. The amount so
47 calculated shall be distributed to each school district in fiscal year 2010.
48 For each fiscal year thereafter, the amount distributed pursuant to this
49 subsection for each school district shall be determined as follows:

4
1 (a) Divide the amount distributed to the district pursuant to this sub-
2 section in fiscal year 2010 by the district's support units for fiscal
3 year 2010;
4 (b) Multiply the result of the calculation found in paragraph (a) of
5 this subsection by the number of support units in the current fiscal
6 year;
7 (c) Determine the percentage change in statewide transportation reim-
8 bursements as provided for in subsection (5) of this section since fis-
9 cal year 2010;
10 (d) Determine the percentage change in statewide student enrollment
11 since fiscal year 2010;
12 (e) Subtract the result of the calculation found in paragraph (d) of
13 this subsection from the result of the calculation found in paragraph
14 (c) of this subsection;
15 (f) Adjust the result of the calculation found in paragraph (b) of this
16 subsection by the percentage result from paragraph (e) of this subsec-
17 tion.
18 For school districts divided after fiscal year 2010, the calculation in
19 paragraph (a) of this subsection shall still be based on the fiscal year 2010
20 figures for the formerly consolidated district. For public charter schools
21 beginning operations on or after July 1, 2009, all calculations in this sub-
22 section that are based on fiscal year 2010 shall instead be based on the pub-
23 lic charter school's first fiscal year of operations. For the purposes of
24 this subsection, the support units used shall be the number used for calcu-
25 lating salary-based apportionment. Funds distributed pursuant to this sub-
26 section shall be used to defray the cost of pupil transportation. If the
27 amount distributed is in excess of a school district's actual pupil trans-
28 portation costs, less any state reimbursements provided by subsection (5) of
29 this section, the excess funds may be used at the school district's discre-
30 tion.
31 (8) The total moneys paid to school districts and public charter
32 schools for eligible transportation costs shall be reduced by a proportion-
33 ate amount to equal seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($7,500,000)
34 and shall be used as discretionary spending.
35 (9) (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (5) of this sec-
36 tion, the state's share of the transportation support program will be based
37 on reimbursable transportation costs incurred by a school district during
38 the state fiscal year prior to the immediately preceding state fiscal year
39 if, during the immediately preceding state fiscal year:
40 (a) An emergency occurred in the state or in the area where the school
41 district authorized transportation operation is located. For purposes
42 of this subsection, an emergency includes but is not limited to school
43 closures caused by extreme weather conditions, a fire, an epidemic, or
44 pollution of air or water; and
45 (b) As a direct result of such emergency, the reimbursable transporta-
46 tion costs of a school district an authorized transportation operation
47 decreased by at least ten percent (10%) from the prior fiscal year.
48 (10) (8) Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, for the
49 duration of an emergency described in subsection (9) (7) of this section, the
50 miles for which transportation costs may be reimbursed will be miles:

5
1 (a) Directly associated with transporting students for the purpose of
2 school attendance during regular days and hours; or
3 (b) Related to the delivery of food, delivery of instructional mate-
4 rials, or other trips supporting the continuation of educational ser-
5 vices.
6 (9) As used in this section, "authorized transportation operation"
7 means a school district or public charter school transportation program au-
8 thorized by the state department of education that may include the use of any
9 vehicles authorized pursuant to chapter 15, title 33, Idaho Code.
10 SECTION 2. That Section 33-1501, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
11 amended to read as follows:
12 33-1501. TRANSPORTATION AUTHORIZED. To afford more equal opportu-
13 nity for public school attendance, the board of trustees of each district,
14 including specially chartered school districts, shall, where practicable,
15 provide transportation for the public school pupils within the district,
16 and pupils resident within adjoining districts annually agreed to in writ-
17 ing by the districts involved, under conditions and limitations herein set
18 forth. Nonpublic school students may be transported, where practicable,
19 when the full costs for providing such transportation are recovered. In
20 approving the routing of any school bus, or in the maintenance and operation
21 of all such transportation equipment, or in the appointment or employment of
22 chauffeurs, the primary requirements to be observed by the board of trustees
23 are the safety and adequate protection of the health of the pupils. Nothing
24 herein contained shall prevent any board of trustees from denying trans-
25 portation to any pupil in any school bus operated by or under the authority
26 of said board, upon good cause being given, in writing, to the parents or
27 guardian, or either of them, of such pupil.
28 No board of trustees shall be required to provide transportation for any
29 pupil living less than one and one-half (1 1/2) miles from the nearest ap-
30 propriate school. A board of trustees may require pupils who live less than
31 one and one-half (1 1/2) miles from the nearest established bus stop to walk
32 or provide their own transportation to such bus stop. That distance shall
33 be determined by the nearest and best route from the junction of the driveway
34 of the pupil's home and the nearest public road, to the nearest door of the
35 schoolhouse he attends, or to the bus stop, as the case may be. The board may
36 transport any pupil a lesser distance when in its judgment the age or health
37 or safety of the pupil warrants.
38 A day care center, family day care home, or a group day care facility,
39 as defined in section 39-1102, Idaho Code, may substitute for the student's
40 residence for student transportation to and from school. School districts
41 may not transport students between child care facilities and home. Student
42 transportation between a child care facility and a school will qualify for
43 state reimbursement providing that the child care facility is one and one-
44 half (1 1/2) miles or more from the school to which the student is trans-
45 ported.
46 To effectuate the public policy hereby declared, the board of trustees
47 of any school district may purchase or lease, and maintain and operate school
48 buses and vans, which vans shall not have a seating capacity in excess of fif-
49 teen (15) persons authorized vehicles for the transportation of pupils to

6
1 and from school and school-related events; may enter into agreements or con-
2 tracts for the use of a charter bus or buses; may enter into contracts with
3 individuals, firms, corporations or private carriers; or may make payments
4 to parents or guardians, subject to the limitations herein provided, when
5 transportation is not furnished by the district.
6 SECTION 3. That Section 33-1504, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
7 repealed.
