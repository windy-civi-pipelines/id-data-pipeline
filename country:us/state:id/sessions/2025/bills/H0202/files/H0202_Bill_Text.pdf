31 tions from state agencies with particular expertise. All agencies of the
32 state of Idaho shall cooperate with the board by providing requested exist-
33 ing information and studies pertaining in any manner to any matters which are
34 the subject of this act. The board shall have discretion to balance all fac-

47 the authority of any state agency with respect to activities not prohibited
48 by the comprehensive state water plan. The designation of a waterway as a

13
1 natural or recreation river shall not preclude the department of health and
2 welfare environmental quality from establishing water quality standards for

5 shall be filed in the office of the governor and director of the department of
6 water resources, and published and distributed generally.
7 (6) The comprehensive state water plan and any component thereof devel-

13 provided in section 7, article XV, of the constitution of the state of Idaho.

17 (8) The board shall review and reevaluate Part A of the comprehensive

19 prising Part B of the comprehensive state water plan, upon the adoption of a
20 concurrent resolution of the legislature directing the review or requesting
21 a specific amendment to the plan. The board also may undertake the review in
22 response to a petition for amendment filed pursuant to subsection (3) of this
23 section, or upon the board's own initiative, as determined necessary by the
24 board. Amendments to Part A or Part B of the comprehensive state water plan
25 shall be adopted in the same manner as the original plan.
26 (9) A protected river designated by the board shall not become a final
27 part of the comprehensive state water plan until approved by law. If the

31 bition or terms and conditions imposed on such protected river pursuant to
32 subsection (5) or (6) of section 42-1734A, Idaho Code, shall be terminated
33 ten (10) days following the end of the session. The failure to approve a pro-
34 tected river shall not operate to invalidate a comprehensive plan or com-
35 ponent thereof. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the legislature,
36 however, from approving such protected river and reinstituting or modifying
37 such prohibitions or terms and conditions in a subsequent session.
38 (10) After adoption of a comprehensive plan or component thereof, the
39 board shall administer the implementation of the plan.

11 under circumstances likely to result in the spread of the disease, symp-
12 toms, or contaminant to the person who had such contact and only for a
13 reasonable period of time sufficient to determine whether the exposed
14 person will become sick.
15 (c) If the director has reasonable cause to believe a chemical, nu-
16 clear, or biological agent has been released in an identifiable place,
17 including a building or structure, the director may impose an order of
18 restricted access into or out of that place for the purpose of determin-
19 ing whether that place has been contaminated with a chemical, nuclear,
20 or biological agent that may create a substantial and immediate danger
21 to the public. An order of restricted access shall be effective only
22 until such time as the contamination has been remediated and the area
23 of restricted access has been determined to no longer pose an immediate
24 health risk.
25 (d) An order of isolation, quarantine, or restricted access issued pur-
26 suant to this section shall not be subject to the Idaho administrative
27 procedure act, chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, but shall be subject to
28 judicial review as a final agency order. However, this shall not pre-
29 vent the director from reconsidering, amending, or withdrawing the or-
30 der. Judicial review of orders of isolation, quarantine, or restricted
31 access shall be de novo. The court may affirm, reverse, or modify the
32 order and shall affirm the order if the director shows by clear and con-
33 vincing evidence that the order is reasonably necessary to protect the
34 public from a substantial and immediate danger of the spread of an in-
35 fectious or communicable disease or from contamination by a chemical,
36 nuclear, or biological agent. A hearing on a request for review pur-
37 suant to this paragraph shall be held as soon as practicable but no later
38 than three (3) business days after the request is made. Notice of the
39 request for review to the court must be provided to the director. The
40 court may order the person who is the subject of or affected by the or-
41 der of isolation, quarantine, or restricted access to appear remotely
42 via technology approved by the Idaho supreme court. Upon conclusion of
43 a hearing described in this subsection, the court conducting judicial
44 review shall issue an order:
45 (i) Affirming or modifying the order of isolation, quarantine, or
46 restricted access; or
47 (ii) Reversing the order and releasing an individual who is the
48 subject of or affected by such order.
49 (e) Any person who violates an order of isolation, quarantine, or re-
50 stricted access shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

20
1 (8) The director shall develop safeguards necessary to ensure the se-
2 curity of nonpublic personal information in the department's possession and
3 to prevent undue disclosure of such information. The director shall estab-
4 lish a process to authenticate requests made by a person, entity or jurisdic-
5 tion arising under the 2007 Hague convention on the international recovery
6 of child support and other forms of family maintenance. In the event the de-
7 partment becomes aware of any improper disclosure, the director shall take
8 all actions required under section 28-51-105, Idaho Code.
9 SECTION 17. That Section 63-602P, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
10 amended to read as follows:
11 63-602P. PROPERTY EXEMPT FROM TAXATION -- FACILITIES FOR WATER OR AIR
12 POLLUTION CONTROL. (1) The following property is exempt from taxation: fa-
13 cilities, installations, machinery or equipment, attached or unattached to
14 real property, and designed, installed and utilized in the elimination, con-
15 trol or prevention of water or air pollution, or, in event such facilities,
16 installations, equipment or machinery shall also serve other beneficial
17 purposes and uses, such portion of the assessed valuation thereof as may
18 reasonably be calculated to be necessary for and devoted to elimination,
19 control or prevention of water or air pollution. The state tax commission or
20 county assessor shall determine such exempt portion, and shall not include
21 as exempt any portion of any facilities which have value as the specific
22 source of marketable byproducts by-products.
23 (2) If any water corporation, as defined by section 61-125, Idaho Code,
24 regulated by the Idaho public utilities commission is or has been ordered by
25 the state board of health department of environmental quality or the Idaho
26 public utilities commission to install equipment designed and utilized in
27 the elimination, control or prevention of water pollution, the Idaho public
28 utilities commission shall notify the Idaho state tax commission of the per-
29 centage such property bears to the total invested plant of the company and
30 said portion shall be exempt from property taxation. Said percentage re-
31 ported to the Idaho state tax commission by the Idaho public utilities com-
32 mission may be contested by any person or party at a public hearing held be-
33 fore the Idaho state tax commission.
34 SECTION 18. That Section 63-1309, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
35 amended to read as follows:
36 63-1309. SPECIAL TAXING DISTRICT OR BOND PROPOSAL DEFEATED IN ELEC-
37 TION BARS SUBSEQUENT ELECTIONS FOR SPECIFIED TIME -- EXCEPTION -- BOARD OF
38 EDUCATION MAY CONDUCT ELECTION -- MUNICIPALITIES, WATER OR SEWER DISTRICTS
39 MAY CONDUCT BOND ELECTION. If any election has been held for the formation of
40 any special taxing district, or for the approval of any bond issue or other
41 proposal which that would have resulted in a property tax levy, and the pro-
42 posal submitted at such election was defeated, no subsequent election shall
43 be held within two (2) months from and after the date of such prior election
44 for the same or a similar purpose in any district which that includes any
45 part of the area which that was affected by the prior election. In the event
46 any school building is destroyed or rendered unusable for school purposes by
47 reason of fire, flood or other catastrophe, and a school bond election for

21
1 the purpose of the replacement of such building is prohibited by the provi-
2 sions of this section or by the provisions of section 34-106, Idaho Code, the
3 state board of education shall have the power to authorize an election for
4 such purpose by order based upon a finding of such facts. The provisions of
5 this section shall not apply to school elections held solely for determining
6 property tax levies for general school purposes not involving the issuance
7 of bonds. This time requirement between elections shall not apply to munici-
8 palities or water and/or sewer districts when bond issues are being proposed
9 for the installation or improvement of water supply systems or public sewer-
10 age systems which that have been deemed necessary by the Idaho state board of
11 health and welfare department of environmental quality to bring such system
12 or systems in conformance with state statutes or rules of the state board of
13 health and welfare.
14 SECTION 19. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
15 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
16 July 1, 2025.
