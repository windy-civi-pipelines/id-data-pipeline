26 created in the office of the state treasurer a dedicated fund to be known as
27 the hospital assessment fund, hereinafter "fund," to be administered by the
28 department of health and welfare, hereinafter "department." The state trea-
29 surer shall invest idle moneys in the fund and any interest received on those
30 investments shall be returned to the fund.
31 (2) Moneys in the fund shall consist of:
32 (a) All moneys collected or received by the department from private
33 hospital assessments required by this chapter;
34 (b) All federal matching funds received by the department as a result
35 of expenditures made by the department that are attributable to moneys
36 deposited in the fund;
37 (c) Any interest or penalties levied in conjunction with the adminis-
38 tration of this chapter; and
39 (d) Any appropriations, federal funds, donations, gifts or moneys from
40 any other sources.
8
1 (3) The fund is created for the purpose of receiving moneys in accor-
2 dance with this section and section 56-1404, Idaho Code. Moneys in the fund
3 shall be distributed by the department subject to appropriation for the fol-
4 lowing purposes only:
5 (a) Payments to private hospitals as required under Idaho's medical as-
6 sistance program as set forth in sections 56-209b through 56-209d and
7 56-209c, Idaho Code;
8 (b) Reimbursement of moneys collected by the department from private
9 hospitals through error or mistake in performing the activities autho-
10 rized under Idaho's medical assistance program;
11 (c) Payments of administrative expenses incurred by the department or
12 its agent in performing the activities authorized by this chapter;
13 (d) Payments made to the federal government to repay excess payments
14 made to private hospitals from the fund if the assessment plan is deemed
15 out of compliance and after the state has appealed the findings. Hospi-
16 tals shall refund the payments in question to the assessment fund. The
17 state in turn shall return funds to both the federal government and hos-
18 pital providers in the same proportion as the original financing. Indi-
19 vidual hospitals shall be reimbursed based on the proportion of the in-
20 dividual hospital's assessment to the total assessment paid by all pri-
21 vate hospitals. If a hospital is unable to refund payments, the state
22 shall develop a payment plan and deduct moneys from future medicaid pay-
23 ments;
24 (e) Transfers to any other fund in the state treasury, provided such
25 transfers shall not exceed the amount transferred previously from that
26 other fund into the hospital assessment fund; and
27 (f) Making refunds to hospitals pursuant to section 56-1410, Idaho
28 Code; and
29 (g) (f) Offsetting general funding needed to support Idaho medicaid.
30 SECTION 65. That Section 56-1404, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
31 amended to read as follows:
32 56-1404. ASSESSMENTS. (1) All private hospitals, except those ex-
33 empted under section 56-1408, Idaho Code, shall make payments to the fund in
34 accordance with this chapter. Subject to section 56-1410, Idaho Code, an An
35 annual assessment on both inpatient and outpatient services is determined
36 for each qualifying hospital for each state fiscal year in an amount calcu-
37 lated by multiplying the rate, as set forth in subsections (2)(c) and (3)(b)
38 of this section, by the assessment base, as set forth in subsection (5) of
39 this section.
40 (2)(a) The department shall calculate the private hospital upper pay-
41 ment limit gap for both inpatient and outpatient services. The upper
42 payment limit gap is the difference between the maximum allowable pay-
43 ments eligible for federal match, less medicaid payments not financed
44 using hospital assessment funds. The upper payment limit gap shall be
45 calculated separately for hospital inpatient and outpatient services.
46 Medicaid disproportionate share payments shall be excluded from the
47 calculation.
48 (b) Idaho medicaid will start work toward approval by the centers for
49 medicare and medicaid services (CMS) of an updated upper payment limit
9
1 calculation methodology no later than July 1, 2022. This change is
2 needed due to the change reflected in section 56-265, Idaho Code, in re-
3 imbursement from retrospective cost settlements to prospective payment
4 systems.
5 (c) The department shall calculate the upper payment limit assessment
6 rate for each state fiscal year to be the percentage that, when multi-
7 plied by the assessment base as defined in subsection (5) of this sec-
8 tion, equals the upper payment limit payment.
9 (d) Beginning July 1, 2022, or upon approval by CMS, whichever is later,
10 the assessment rate referenced in paragraph (c) of this subsection will
11 increase to the amount needed to attain an increased supplemental upper
12 payment limit payment. This payment amount is subject to CMS approval
13 of the updated upper payment limit methodology described in paragraph
14 (a) of this subsection and legislative appropriation.
15 (e) Beginning July 1, 2023, an additional amount will be assessed at
16 thirty percent (30%) of the upper payment limit payment to be utilized
17 for general fund medicaid needs.
18 (f) If CMS does not approve the updated upper payment limit methodology
19 described in paragraph (b) of this subsection, then the additional as-
20 sessment described in paragraph (e) of this subsection shall not be im-
21 plemented.
22 (g) The assessment described in paragraph (e) of this subsection shall
23 be assessed only if the upper payment limit payment is greater than the
24 total assessment.
25 (3)(a) The department shall calculate the disproportionate share al-
26 lotment amount to be paid to private in-state hospitals.
27 (b) The department shall calculate the disproportionate share assess-
28 ment rate for private in-state hospitals to be the percentage that, when
29 multiplied by the assessment base as defined in subsection (5) of this
30 section, equals the amount of state funding necessary to pay the private
31 in-state hospital disproportionate share allotment determined in para-
32 graph (a) of this subsection.
33 (4) For private in-state hospitals, the assessments calculated pur-
34 suant to subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall not be greater than

13 other than to the spouse of the person receiving or applying for medical as-
14 sistance, and to interspousal transfers that occur prior to October 1, 1989.
15 (4) (5) The provisions of section 1917(c) of the social security act
16 as amended by public law 100-360 and further amended by public law 100-485
17 and as hereafter amended shall apply as of July 1, 1989, to transfers of as-
18 sets other than to the spouse, and as of October 1, 1989, to transfers be-
19 tween spouses, except that such provisions shall not apply either to trans-
20 fers that occurred before July 1, 1988, or to transfers that have been fully
21 accounted for under subsection (3) (4) of this section. Notwithstanding the
22 foregoing, any transfer of assets not otherwise specifically permitted by
23 federal law or rule of the department not for fair market value is presumed
24 to be for the purpose of sheltering assets to qualify for medical assistance.
25 Such assets transferred shall be counted as available in determining eligi-
26 bility, and will subject the applicant to penalties prescribed by the direc-
27 tor, unless the applicant for assistance can demonstrate by clear and con-
28 vincing evidence that the transfer was intended for another purpose.
29 (5) (6) Any funds, securities, accounts, contracts and all other
30 property held in or transferred to a special needs trust as provided in
31 chapter 14, title 68, Idaho Code, section 15-5-409, Idaho Code, and section
32 15-5-409a, Idaho Code, shall not be considered by the state department in
33 determining whether the applicant is eligible for public assistance under
34 the provisions of this act, so long as the action is permitted under the pro-
35 visions of section 1917(c) and (d) of the social security act, as amended.
36 (6) (7) If any provision of this section or the application thereof to
37 any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not af-
38 fect other provisions or applications of the section that can be given effect
39 without the invalid provisions or applications, and to this end the provi-
40 sions of this section are severable.

38 SECTION 108. That Section 56-1036, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
39 hereby amended to read as follows:
40 56-1036. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. (1) The legislature finds that acciden-
41 tal poisoning is a serious public health problem in the state of Idaho and
42 is a problem that disproportionately affects Idaho's children. It further
43 finds that a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality resulting
44 from such accidental poisonings has occurred as a result of the services pro-
45 vided by the poison control center.
46 (2) The purpose of sections 56-1036 through 56-1040 56-1039, Idaho
47 Code, is to declare legislative support for the important work of the poison
48 control center and to assure, by statute, the continued existence of the
49 poison control center.
30
1 (3) The legislature finds that the poison control center has saved
2 lives and reduced suffering associated with poisoning by providing emer-
3 gency telephone assistance and treatment referral to victims of such
4 incidents, by providing immediate treatment information to health care pro-
5 fessionals, and by providing public education and prevention programs.
6 (4) The legislature recognizes that enhanced cooperation between the
7 emergency medical system and poison control centers will aid in responding
8 to emergencies resulting from exposure to poisons and that, by providing
9 telephone assistance to individuals with possible exposure to poisons, the
10 need for emergency room and professional office visits will be reduced. As
11 a result, the cost of health care to those who may have been poisoned will be
12 avoided or reduced and appropriate treatment will be assured.

18 and provide support in a manner consistent with sections 56-1036 through
19 56-1040 56-1039, Idaho Code, a statewide poison control center. The poison
20 control center shall offer the following services:
21 (1) Provide twenty-four (24) hour emergency telephone management and
22 treatment referral of victims of poisoning to include determining whether
23 treatment can be accomplished at the scene of the incident or transport to
24 an emergency treatment or other facility is required, and carrying out tele-
25 phone follow-up to families and other individuals to assure that adequate
26 care is provided;

26 created in the office of the state treasurer a dedicated fund to be known as
27 the hospital assessment fund, hereinafter "fund," to be administered by the
28 department of health and welfare, hereinafter "department." The state trea-
29 surer shall invest idle moneys in the fund and any interest received on those
30 investments shall be returned to the fund.
31 (2) Moneys in the fund shall consist of:
32 (a) All moneys collected or received by the department from private
33 hospital assessments required by this chapter;
34 (b) All federal matching funds received by the department as a result
35 of expenditures made by the department that are attributable to moneys
36 deposited in the fund;
37 (c) Any interest or penalties levied in conjunction with the adminis-
38 tration of this chapter; and
39 (d) Any appropriations, federal funds, donations, gifts or moneys from
40 any other sources.

8
1 (3) The fund is created for the purpose of receiving moneys in accor-
2 dance with this section and section 56-1404, Idaho Code. Moneys in the fund
3 shall be distributed by the department subject to appropriation for the fol-
4 lowing purposes only:
5 (a) Payments to private hospitals as required under Idaho's medical as-
6 sistance program as set forth in sections 56-209b through 56-209d and
7 56-209c, Idaho Code;
8 (b) Reimbursement of moneys collected by the department from private
9 hospitals through error or mistake in performing the activities autho-
10 rized under Idaho's medical assistance program;
11 (c) Payments of administrative expenses incurred by the department or
12 its agent in performing the activities authorized by this chapter;
13 (d) Payments made to the federal government to repay excess payments
14 made to private hospitals from the fund if the assessment plan is deemed
15 out of compliance and after the state has appealed the findings. Hospi-
16 tals shall refund the payments in question to the assessment fund. The
17 state in turn shall return funds to both the federal government and hos-
18 pital providers in the same proportion as the original financing. Indi-
19 vidual hospitals shall be reimbursed based on the proportion of the in-
20 dividual hospital's assessment to the total assessment paid by all pri-
21 vate hospitals. If a hospital is unable to refund payments, the state
22 shall develop a payment plan and deduct moneys from future medicaid pay-
23 ments;
24 (e) Transfers to any other fund in the state treasury, provided such
25 transfers shall not exceed the amount transferred previously from that
26 other fund into the hospital assessment fund; and
27 (f) Making refunds to hospitals pursuant to section 56-1410, Idaho
28 Code; and
29 (g) (f) Offsetting general funding needed to support Idaho medicaid.
30 SECTION 65. That Section 56-1404, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
31 amended to read as follows:
32 56-1404. ASSESSMENTS. (1) All private hospitals, except those ex-
33 empted under section 56-1408, Idaho Code, shall make payments to the fund in
34 accordance with this chapter. Subject to section 56-1410, Idaho Code, an An
35 annual assessment on both inpatient and outpatient services is determined
36 for each qualifying hospital for each state fiscal year in an amount calcu-
37 lated by multiplying the rate, as set forth in subsections (2)(c) and (3)(b)
38 of this section, by the assessment base, as set forth in subsection (5) of
39 this section.
40 (2)(a) The department shall calculate the private hospital upper pay-
41 ment limit gap for both inpatient and outpatient services. The upper
42 payment limit gap is the difference between the maximum allowable pay-
43 ments eligible for federal match, less medicaid payments not financed
44 using hospital assessment funds. The upper payment limit gap shall be
45 calculated separately for hospital inpatient and outpatient services.
46 Medicaid disproportionate share payments shall be excluded from the
47 calculation.
48 (b) Idaho medicaid will start work toward approval by the centers for
49 medicare and medicaid services (CMS) of an updated upper payment limit

9
1 calculation methodology no later than July 1, 2022. This change is
2 needed due to the change reflected in section 56-265, Idaho Code, in re-
3 imbursement from retrospective cost settlements to prospective payment
4 systems.
5 (c) The department shall calculate the upper payment limit assessment
6 rate for each state fiscal year to be the percentage that, when multi-
7 plied by the assessment base as defined in subsection (5) of this sec-
8 tion, equals the upper payment limit payment.
9 (d) Beginning July 1, 2022, or upon approval by CMS, whichever is later,
10 the assessment rate referenced in paragraph (c) of this subsection will
11 increase to the amount needed to attain an increased supplemental upper
12 payment limit payment. This payment amount is subject to CMS approval
13 of the updated upper payment limit methodology described in paragraph
14 (a) of this subsection and legislative appropriation.
15 (e) Beginning July 1, 2023, an additional amount will be assessed at
16 thirty percent (30%) of the upper payment limit payment to be utilized
17 for general fund medicaid needs.
18 (f) If CMS does not approve the updated upper payment limit methodology
19 described in paragraph (b) of this subsection, then the additional as-
20 sessment described in paragraph (e) of this subsection shall not be im-
21 plemented.
22 (g) The assessment described in paragraph (e) of this subsection shall
23 be assessed only if the upper payment limit payment is greater than the
24 total assessment.
25 (3)(a) The department shall calculate the disproportionate share al-
26 lotment amount to be paid to private in-state hospitals.
27 (b) The department shall calculate the disproportionate share assess-
28 ment rate for private in-state hospitals to be the percentage that, when
29 multiplied by the assessment base as defined in subsection (5) of this
30 section, equals the amount of state funding necessary to pay the private
31 in-state hospital disproportionate share allotment determined in para-
32 graph (a) of this subsection.
33 (4) For private in-state hospitals, the assessments calculated pur-
34 suant to subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall not be greater than
35 the federal limit as referenced in 42 CFR 433.68 of the assessment base as
36 defined in subsection (5) of this section.
37 (5) The assessment base shall be the hospital's net patient revenue
38 for the applicable period. Net patient revenue, beginning with state fis-
39 cal year 2023, shall be determined using each hospital's fiscal year 2021
40 medicare cost report on file with the department, without regard to any sub-
41 sequent adjustments or changes to such data. If the 2021 cost report has not
42 been filed, the prior year's cost report will be used. Net patient revenue
43 for each state fiscal year thereafter shall be determined in the same manner
44 using a rolling yearly schedule for each hospital's fiscal year medicare
45 cost report.
46 SECTION 66. That Section 56-1405, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
47 repealed.
48 SECTION 67. That Section 56-1407, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby

7 56-1504. NURSING FACILITY ASSESSMENT FUND. (1) There is hereby cre-
8 ated in the office of the state treasurer a dedicated fund to be known as
9 the nursing facility assessment fund, hereinafter the "fund," to be adminis-
10 tered by the department. The state treasurer shall invest idle moneys in the
11 fund and any interest received on those investments shall be returned to the
12 fund.
13 (2) Moneys in the fund shall consist of:
14 (a) All moneys collected or received by the department from nursing fa-
15 cility assessments required pursuant to this chapter;
16 (b) All federal matching funds received by the department as a result
17 of expenditures made by the department that are attributable to moneys
18 deposited in the fund;
19 (c) Any interest or penalties levied in conjunction with the adminis-
20 tration of this chapter; and
21 (d) Any appropriations, federal funds, donations, gifts or moneys from
22 any other sources.
23 (3) The fund is created for the purpose of receiving moneys in accor-
24 dance with this section and section 56-1511, Idaho Code. Collected assess-
25 ment funds shall be used to secure federal matching funds available through
26 the state medicaid plan, which funds shall be used to make medicaid payments
27 for nursing facility services that equal or exceed the amount of nursing fa-
28 cility medicaid rates, in the aggregate, as calculated in accordance with
29 the approved state medicaid plan in effect on June 30, 2009. The fund shall
30 be used exclusively for the following purposes:
31 (a) To pay administrative expenses incurred by the department or its
32 agent in performing the activities authorized pursuant to this chapter,
33 provided that such expenses shall not exceed a total of one percent (1%)
34 of the aggregate assessment funds collected for the prior fiscal year.
35 (b) To reimburse the medicaid share of the assessment in accordance
36 with IDAPA 16.03.10.264.

38 SECTION 108. That Section 56-1036, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
39 hereby amended to read as follows:
40 56-1036. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. (1) The legislature finds that acciden-
41 tal poisoning is a serious public health problem in the state of Idaho and
42 is a problem that disproportionately affects Idaho's children. It further
43 finds that a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality resulting
44 from such accidental poisonings has occurred as a result of the services pro-
45 vided by the poison control center.
46 (2) The purpose of sections 56-1036 through 56-1040 56-1039, Idaho
47 Code, is to declare legislative support for the important work of the poison
48 control center and to assure, by statute, the continued existence of the
49 poison control center.

30
1 (3) The legislature finds that the poison control center has saved
2 lives and reduced suffering associated with poisoning by providing emer-
3 gency telephone assistance and treatment referral to victims of such
4 incidents, by providing immediate treatment information to health care pro-
5 fessionals, and by providing public education and prevention programs.
6 (4) The legislature recognizes that enhanced cooperation between the
7 emergency medical system and poison control centers will aid in responding
8 to emergencies resulting from exposure to poisons and that, by providing
9 telephone assistance to individuals with possible exposure to poisons, the
10 need for emergency room and professional office visits will be reduced. As
11 a result, the cost of health care to those who may have been poisoned will be
12 avoided or reduced and appropriate treatment will be assured.
13 SECTION 109. That Section 56-1037, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
14 hereby amended to read as follows:
15 56-1037. POISON CONTROL CENTER ESTABLISHED -- SERVICES OFFERED. The

18 and provide support in a manner consistent with sections 56-1036 through
19 56-1040 56-1039, Idaho Code, a statewide poison control center. The poison
20 control center shall offer the following services:
21 (1) Provide twenty-four (24) hour emergency telephone management and
22 treatment referral of victims of poisoning to include determining whether
23 treatment can be accomplished at the scene of the incident or transport to
24 an emergency treatment or other facility is required, and carrying out tele-
25 phone follow-up to families and other individuals to assure that adequate
26 care is provided;
27 (2) Provide information to health professionals involved in management
