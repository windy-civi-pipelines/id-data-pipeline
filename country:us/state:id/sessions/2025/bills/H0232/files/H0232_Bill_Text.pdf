23 person to whom issued to take such wildlife as may be authorized by said li-
24 cense, subject to the limitations set forth under this title and commission
25 regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. Except as otherwise provided by
26 law relating to the release of information to a governmental entity or law

38 SECTION 2. That Chapter 4, Title 36, Idaho Code, be, and the same is
39 hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and des-
40 ignated as Section 36-408A, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:

2
1 36-408A. DEER AND ELK TAGS LIMITED FOR NONRESIDENTS -- SALE OF TAGS TO
2 RESIDENTS AT NONRESIDENT PRICES. (1) It is the intent of the legislature to
3 improve deer and elk hunting opportunities for residents by limiting non-
4 resident participation with a net neutral effect to the substantial revenue
5 that has historically been collected by the department from sales of deer and
6 elk tags and licenses that are priced higher for nonresidents than for resi-
7 dents.
8 (2) For the purposes of this section:
9 (a) "Capped hunt" means a hunt framework for which the commission has
10 set a limit on the total number of tags available to residents and non-
11 residents by game management zone, unit, or other hunt area. Tags in a
12 capped hunt are available to residents over the counter, without a draw-
13 ing by lot, and are available to nonresidents either over the counter or
14 by drawing by lot.
15 (b) "Controlled hunt" means a hunt framework for which the commission
16 has set a limit on the total number of tags available to residents and
17 nonresidents in a drawing by lot by game management zone, unit, or other
18 hunt area.
19 (c) "Nonresident-limited/resident-unlimited" means a framework for
20 which the commission has set a limit on the number of tags available to
21 nonresidents but has not set a limit on the number of tags available to
22 residents. Tags in this hunt framework are available to residents over
23 the counter and are available to nonresidents either over the counter
24 or by drawing by lot. The commission may set nonresident tag limits
25 pursuant to this paragraph by game management zone, unit, or other hunt
26 area that may be divisions of the hunt area in which resident tags may be
27 used.
28 (3) Beginning with hunting licenses and deer and elk tags sold for
29 use in calendar year 2027, not more than ten percent (10%), rounded to the
30 nearest whole percent, of the total tags for each capped hunt, controlled
31 hunt, and nonresident-limited/resident-unlimited hunt, pursuant to com-
32 mission proclamation by game management zone, unit, or other hunt area, may
33 be available for sale to nonresidents. The commission shall estimate the
34 total number of tags available to nonresidents for nonresident-limited/res-
35 ident-unlimited hunts based on historic use.
36 (4) The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
37 (a) Tags for which eligibility is based on private landowner's desig-
38 nation or permission, as authorized by statute, rule, proclamation, or-
39 der, or other authorization to control depredation;
40 (b) Tags purchased by lifetime license certificate holders who are no
41 longer Idaho residents or by persons establishing Idaho residency that
42 are not yet qualified to purchase a resident license;
43 (c) Free tags to minor children with life-threatening medical condi-
44 tions, military veterans with disabilities, or governor's wildlife
45 partnership tags, each of which may be issued pursuant to section
46 36-408, Idaho Code; and
47 (d) Nonresident junior mentored tags.
48 (5) The commission may set aside annually and reserve for sale to hold-
49 ers of nonresident disabled veteran licenses nonresident disabled veteran
50 deer and elk tags at fees provided in section 36-416, Idaho Code, for use in

3
1 nonresident-limited/resident-unlimited hunts, not to exceed five hundred
2 (500) tags for deer and three hundred (300) tags for elk. Such nonresident
3 disabled veteran tags shall be excluded from the provisions of this section.
4 Holders of nonresident disabled veteran licenses shall be eligible to pur-
5 chase deer and elk tags at the regular nonresident tag fees provided in sec-
6 tion 36-416, Idaho Code, and subject to regular nonresident limits.
7 (6) For capped hunts in which tags were available for sale to nonresi-
8 dents directly and via allocation of nonresident tags to outfitted hunters
9 in excess of ten percent (10%) of total tags prior to January 1, 2027, the
10 commission may authorize a number of tags, not more than the number of tags
11 previously available in excess of ten percent (10%), for sale to residents as
12 a first tag at the nonresident tag prices provided in section 36-416, Idaho
13 Code, with total tag numbers for the hunt to remain within the limits set by
14 the commission.
15 (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if the respective
16 statewide quota set by the commission for nonresident deer or elk tags has
17 not been met by July 31, the commission may authorize the sale of tags at the
18 nonresident tag fee provided in section 36-416, Idaho Code, as follows:
19 (a) To nonresidents as first or second tags for capped hunts if the to-
20 tal tag limit set by the commission for the hunt has not been met or for
21 nonresident-limited/resident-unlimited if the nonresident limit has
22 not been met; and
23 (b) To residents as second tags for use in the same manner as a resident
24 tag in a capped hunt if the total tag limit set by the commission has not
25 been met or in a nonresident-limited/resident-unlimited hunt.
26 (8) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, in controlled
27 hunts with fewer than ten (10) total tags available, a single tag may be
28 available for drawing by nonresidents.
29 (9) The commission is authorized to promulgate rules, subject to leg-
30 islative approval, necessary to implement the provisions of this section.
31 The commission may prescribe whether sales to nonresidents for capped hunts
32 and nonresident-limited/resident-unlimited hunts are over the counter or by
33 drawing by lot, subject to controlled hunt application fees as provided in
34 section 36-416, Idaho Code.
35 (10) Upon a finding by the commission that sales of hunting licenses and
36 deer and elk tags pursuant to this section are generating less revenue than
37 was generated previously by nonresident participation at levels above ten
38 percent (10%) and that department operations are negatively impacted, the
39 commission is authorized, for tag sales for calendar year 2029 or later, to
40 issue an order to restore a level of nonresident participation to not more
41 than the statewide nonresident tag quotas set by rule. The commission shall
42 give notice of any such order to the director of the legislative services of-
43 fice for review by the germane joint subcommittee as soon as possible after
44 adoption by the commission.
45 SECTION 3. That Section 36-408, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
46 amended to read as follows:
47 36-408. COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY -- TAGS -- PERMITS -- NONRESIDENTS
48 LIMITED -- OUTFITTERS SET-ASIDE. (1) Tags and Permits -- Method of Use. The
49 commission is hereby authorized to prescribe the number and kind of wildlife

4
1 that may be taken under authority of the several types of tags and permits
2 provided for in this title and the manner in which said tags and permits shall
3 be used and validated. All Idaho wolf tags will be valid for hunting, trap-
4 ping, and snaring in any unit when seasons are open at the time of take. There
5 shall be no limit to the number of wolf tags that an individual can purchase.
6 All appropriate fish and game education requirements must be met.
7 (2) Limit -- Licenses, Tags or Permits -- Controlled Hunts. The commis-
8 sion is hereby authorized to establish a limit annually as to the number of
9 each kind and class of licenses, tags, or permits to be sold or issued and is
10 further authorized to limit the number or prohibit entirely the participa-
11 tion by nonresidents in controlled hunts.
12 (3) Outfitted Hunter Tags Set-Aside. When the commission establishes a
13 limit as to the number of nonresident deer tags and nonresident elk tags, it
14 shall set aside, when setting big game seasons, in a statewide pool, a maxi-
15 mum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the nonresident deer tag and nonresident
16 elk tag limit. These tags may be allocated to the outfitted hunters in capped
17 hunts and controlled hunts and set aside for outfitted hunter use in general
18 hunts.
19 Such outfitted allocated set-aside tags shall be separate from the tag
20 numbers set for residents and nonresidents in each capped or controlled
21 hunt, unit, or game management area. The set-aside tags shall be sold pur-
22 suant to commission rule, only to persons that have entered into a signed
23 agreement for that year to utilize the services of an outfitter licensed
24 pursuant to chapter 21, title 36, Idaho Code.
25 In order for a person to purchase any set-aside nonresident deer tag or
26 nonresident elk tag, that person's outfitter must submit an application with
27 the proper fees as required by the director. If any nonresident deer tags or
28 nonresident elk tags set aside for use in general hunts pursuant to this sub-
29 section are unsold by July 15 of the year in which they were set aside, they
30 may be sold by the department to the general public pursuant to commission
31 rule. If any nonresident deer tags or nonresident elk tags set aside as gen-
32 eral capped allocated tags pursuant to this subsection are unsold by July 31
33 of the year in which they were set aside, they may be sold by the department to
34 the general public pursuant to commission rule.
35 The commission may promulgate all necessary rules to implement the pro-
36 visions of this subsection.
37 (4) Deer and Elk Tag Allocation. When setting big game seasons, if the
38 commission limits the number of deer or elk tags available for use in any game
39 management area, unit, or zone, the commission may allocate by rule, where
40 there are outfitted operations, a number of deer and elk tags from the out-
41 fitted hunter set-aside pool of tags for use by hunters that have entered
42 into a signed agreement for that year to utilize the services of an outfit-
43 ter licensed pursuant to chapter 21, title 36, Idaho Code.
44 In addition to rules promulgated by the commission regarding allo-
45 cation, or pursuant to this section, in capped hunts the commission may
46 allocate the number of outfitted hunter elk and deer tags based on the high-
47 est number within each of the last two (2) years of all elk or deer tags using
48 the services of an outfitter in each capped hunt. Any additional tags above
49 the original outfitted hunter tag quota may come from the nonresident out-
50 fitted hunter set-aside pool or the nonresident quota in the capped hunt,

5
1 not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the nonresident quota for each capped
2 hunt. In capped hunts, when tag numbers change for all users, they will apply
3 proportionally to all user groups.
4 In controlled hunts, the commission may allocate the number of outfit-
5 ted hunter elk or deer tags based on a number compiled from each outfitter's
6 highest year within the last two (2) years of all elk or deer tags using
7 the services of an outfitter for each controlled hunt. Any additional tags
8 above the original outfitted hunter tag quota may come from the nonresident
9 outfitted hunter set-aside pool or the nonresident quota in the controlled
10 hunt, not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the nonresident quota for each
11 controlled hunt.
12 Outfitted hunter tag use history will be provided through records from
13 the sale of outfitted hunter tags compiled by the Idaho department of fish
14 and game and verified use other than allocated tags recorded with the depart-
15 ment by December 20 by outfitters. The department shall distribute the allo-
16 cated outfitted tags through its point-of-sale machines.
17 Beginning December 1, 2020, all outfitted deer and elk tag use shall be
18 verified in order to qualify for allocated outfitted hunter tag use history.
19 Verification consists of the purchase of allocated tags from the Idaho de-
20 partment of fish and game or the use of an outfitter-provided agreement, in-
21 cluding the tag number that is recorded with the department.
22 All big game tags used in allocated outfitted hunts must be recorded by
23 outfitters with the department by December 20 each year. An administrative
24 fee of five dollars ($5.00) shall be assessed for each allocated outfitted
25 big game tag sold or exchanged at a point-of-sale machine. An administrative
26 fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be assessed for each big game tag sub-
27 mitted for verification as being outfitted.
28 The allocated tags shall be designated by the Idaho outfitters and
29 guides licensing board to those authorized outfitting operations licensed
30 for elk and deer hunting for the use by the outfitted hunter, pursuant to
31 section 36-2107(h), Idaho Code.
32 Those tags not qualified for allocated tag use history include emer-
33 gency depredation, landowner appreciation program hunts, or meat packing
34 without an outfitted allocated deer or elk tag.
35 The commission may promulgate all necessary rules to implement the pro-
36 visions of this subsection.
37 (5) (3) Special Game Tags. The commission is hereby authorized to issue
38 two (2) special bighorn sheep tags per year.
39 (a) Auction bighorn sheep tag. One (1) special bighorn sheep tag shall
40 be auctioned off by an incorporated nonprofit organization dedicated
41 to wildlife conservation selected by the commission. The tag shall be
42 issued by the department of fish and game to the highest eligible bid-
43 der. No more than five percent (5%) of all proceeds for the tag may be
44 retained by the organization. The tag to be issued pursuant to this
45 subsection shall be taken from the nonresident bighorn sheep tag quota.
46 The net proceeds shall be forwarded to the director for deposit in the
47 fish and game expendable trust account and shall be used for bighorn
48 sheep research and management purposes. Moneys raised pursuant to this
49 subsection may not be used to transplant additional bighorn sheep into
50 that portion of southwest Idaho south of the Snake river and west of U.S.

6
1 highway no. 93, nor for litigation or environmental impact statements
2 involving bighorn sheep. No transplants of bighorn sheep accomplished
3 with moneys raised pursuant to this subsection shall occur in any area
4 until hearings are conducted in the area. Provided however, that none
5 of the proceeds generated from the auction of bighorn sheep tags pur-
6 suant to this paragraph be used to purchase or acquire private property
7 or federally managed grazing permits, nor shall any proceeds generated
8 be used for matching funds for the purchase of private property or the
9 retirement or the acquisition of federally managed grazing permits.
10 (b) Lottery bighorn sheep tag. The commission is also authorized to
11 issue one (1) special bighorn sheep tag, which will be disposed of by
12 lottery. The lottery permit can be marketed by the department of fish
13 and game or a nonprofit organization dedicated to wildlife conservation
14 selected by the commission. The tag will be issued by the department of
15 fish and game to an eligible person drawn from the lottery provided in
16 this subsection. No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of gross rev-
17 enue can be retained for administrative costs by the organization. All
18 net proceeds for the tag disposed of by lottery pursuant to this subsec-
19 tion shall be remitted to the department and deposited in the fish and
20 game expendable trust account. Moneys in the account from the lottery
21 bighorn sheep tag shall be utilized by the department in solving prob-
22 lems between bighorn sheep and domestic sheep, solving problems between
23 wildlife and domestic animals, or improving relationships between
24 sportsmen and private landowners.
25 (6) (4) Issuance of Free Permit or Tag to Minor Children with
26 Life-Threatening Medical Conditions. Notwithstanding any other provision
27 of law, the commission may issue free big game permits or tags to minor chil-
28 dren who have life-threatening medical conditions that have been certified
29 eligible by a qualified organization. The commission may prescribe by rule
30 the manner and conditions of issuing and using the permits or tags authorized
31 under this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, a "qualified or-
32 ganization" means a nonprofit organization that is qualified under section
33 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and that affords opportunities and
34 experiences to minor children with life-threatening medical conditions.
35 (7) (5) Issuance of Free Permit or Tag to Military Veterans with Dis-
36 abilities. The commission may prescribe by rule the manner and conditions of
37 using the permits or tags authorized under this subsection. Notwithstand-
38 ing any other provision of law, the commission shall issue five (5) free big
39 game permits or tags to disabled military veterans whose disability has been
40 certified eligible by the Idaho division of veterans services. All veterans
41 applying must be sponsored by a "qualified organization," which for purposes
42 of this subsection means a governmental agency that assists veterans or a
43 nonprofit organization that is qualified under section 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4)
44 or 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code and that affords opportunities,
45 experiences and assistance to disabled veterans. The Idaho division of vet-
46 erans services shall screen all applicants to ensure only the most deserving
47 disabled veterans shall be issued these permits or tags. A list of screened
48 applicants shall be provided to the commission in priority order for is-
49 suance. The commission shall issue one (1) permit or tag each to the top two
50 (2) candidates for a sponsored hunt as designated by the Idaho division of

7
1 veterans services and the three (3) remaining permits or tags to candidates
2 sponsored by a qualified organization as described in this subsection.
3 (8) (6) Special Wolf Tags. The commission is hereby authorized to issue
4 up to ten (10) special auction or lottery tags for hunting wolves. Special
5 wolf tags will be auctioned off or made available through lottery by incor-
6 porated nonprofit organizations dedicated to wildlife conservation and se-
7 lected by the director. No more than five percent (5%) of all proceeds for
8 each tag may be retained by the nonprofit organization for administrative
9 costs involved. Each wolf tag shall be issued by the department of fish and
10 game and awarded to the highest eligible bidder or winner of a lottery. Each
11 tag will be good for the harvest of one (1) wolf pursuant to commission rule.
12 The proceeds from each tag will be sent to the director to be placed in the de-
13 partment general license fund.
14 (9) (7) Special Big Game Auction Tags -- Governor's Wildlife Part-
15 nership Tags. The commission is hereby authorized to issue special big
16 game auction tags hereafter named and referred to as "Governor's wildlife
17 partnership tags" for hunting designated species on dates and in areas
18 designated by the commission. To enhance and sustain the value of Idaho's
19 wildlife, up to three (3) tags per species per year may be issued for deer,
20 elk and pronghorn antelope, one (1) tag per year may be issued for moose,
21 and one (1) tag per species per year may be issued for mountain goat and
22 bighorn sheep. Each tag will be signed by the governor of Idaho prior to
23 auction to the public and be available to either residents or nonresidents of
24 Idaho. Governor's wildlife partnership tags issued for deer, elk, pronghorn
25 antelope and moose pursuant to this subsection shall be taken from the non-
26 resident controlled hunt programs for these species adopted by the fish and
27 game commission. Governor's wildlife partnership tags issued for mountain
28 goat and bighorn sheep shall be taken from the nonresident mountain goat and
29 bighorn sheep quota. Governor's wildlife partnership tags shall be auc-
30 tioned off by incorporated nonprofit organizations dedicated to wildlife
31 conservation and selected by the director. No more than five percent (5%) of
32 all proceeds from each tag sale may be retained by the nonprofit organization
33 for administrative costs involved, including in the event a tag is redonated
34 and reauctioned. Each tag shall be issued by the department of fish and game
35 and awarded to the highest eligible bidder. Each tag shall be good for the
36 harvest of one (1) big game animal pursuant to commission rule consistent
37 with the provisions of this subsection. The proceeds from each tag shall be
38 sent to the director to be allocated up to thirty percent (30%) for sportsmen
39 access programs, such as access yes, and the balance for wildlife habitat
40 projects, wildlife management projects to increase the quantity and quality
41 of big game herds, and other research and management activities approved by
42 the commission. Provided however, that none of the proceeds generated from
43 the auctions pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall be used to
44 purchase or acquire private property or federally managed grazing permits,
45 nor shall any proceeds generated be used for matching funds for the purchase
46 of private property or the retirement or the acquisition of federally man-
47 aged grazing permits. Moneys raised pursuant to this subsection may not be
48 used to transplant additional bighorn sheep into that portion of southwest
49 Idaho south of the Snake river and west of U.S. highway no. 93, nor for liti-
50 gation or environmental impact statements involving bighorn sheep.
