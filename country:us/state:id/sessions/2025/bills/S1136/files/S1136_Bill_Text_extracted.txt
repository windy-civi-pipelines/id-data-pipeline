24 agency.

27 privilege in that remote state until the compact privilege is no longer lim-
28 ited or restricted by that state.
29 E. If a home state license is encumbered, the licensee shall lose the

33 longer encumbered due to the adverse action.
34 F. Once a licensee with a restricted or limited license meets the re-
35 quirements of subsection E. of this section, the licensee must also meet the
36 requirements of subsection A. of this section to obtain a compact privilege
37 in a remote state.
38 SECTION 5

45 quired to pay to the commission for a compact privilege any fee that may oth-
46 erwise be charged by the commission. If a remote state chooses to charge a

6 tigative information of a remote state or the home state, as long as the mem-
7 ber state follows its own procedures for imposing adverse action.
8 C. Nothing in this compact shall override a member state's decision
9 that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse
10 action and that such participation shall remain non-public if required by
11 the member state's laws.
12 D. A remote state shall have the authority to:
13 1. Take adverse actions as set forth herein against a licensee's com-
14 pact privilege in that state;
15 2. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require
16 the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evi-
17 dence.

19 thority in a member state for the attendance and testimony of wit-
20 nesses and the production of evidence.
21 b. Subpoenas issued by a respiratory therapy licensing author-
22 ity in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses
23 shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent ju-
24 risdiction in the latter state, according to the practice and pro-
25 cedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings
26 pending before it.
27 c. Subpoenas issued by a respiratory therapy licensing authority
28 in a member state for production of evidence from another member
29 state shall be enforced in the latter state, according to the prac-
30 tice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in
31 the proceedings pending before it.

33 penses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes

37 adverse action taken against that licensee;

39 not issue a subpoena to gather evidence of conduct in another member
40 state that is lawful in such other member state for the purpose of taking
41 adverse action against a licensee's compact privilege or application
42 for compact privilege in that member state; and
43 5. Nothing in this compact authorizes a member state to impose dis-
44 cipline against a respiratory therapist's compact privilege in that
45 member state for the individual's otherwise lawful practice in another
46 state.
47 E. Joint investigations:
48 1. In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its respec-
49 tive respiratory therapy practice act or other applicable state law, a
7
1 member state may participate with other member states in joint inves-
2 tigations of licensees; provided, however, that a member state receiv-
3 ing such a request has no obligation to respond to any subpoena issued
4 regarding an investigation of conduct or practice that was lawful in a
5 member state at the time it was undertaken.
6 2. Member states shall share any significant investigative informa-
7 tion, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint
8 or individual investigation initiated under the compact. In sharing
9 such information between member state respiratory therapy licensing
10 authorities, all information obtained shall be kept confidential, ex-
11 cept as otherwise mutually agreed on by the sharing and receiving member
12 states.
13 F. Nothing in this compact may permit a member state to take any adverse
14 action against a licensee or holder of a compact privilege for conduct or
15 practice that was legal in the member state at the time it was undertaken.
16 G. Nothing in this compact may permit a member state to take disci-
17 plinary action against a licensee or holder of a compact privilege for

9 able expenses of its establishment, organization, and ongoing activi-
10 ties.
11 2. The commission may accept any and all appropriate revenue sources as
12 provided in this compact.
13 3. The commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each
14 member state and impose fees on licensees of member states to whom it
15 grants a compact privilege to cover the cost of the operations and ac-
16 tivities of the commission and its staff. The aggregate annual assess-
17 ment amount for member states, if any, shall be allocated based on a for-
18 mula that the commission shall promulgate by rule.
19 4. The commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to se-
20 curing the funds or a loan adequate to meet the same; nor shall the com-
21 mission pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by and with
22 the authority of the member state.
23 5. The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and dis-
24 bursements. The receipts and disbursements of the commission shall be
25 subject to the financial review and accounting procedures established
26 under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds han-
27 dled by the commission shall be subject to an annual financial review by
28 a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the finan-
29 cial review shall be included in and become part of the annual report of
30 the commission.
31 H. Qualified immunity, defense, and indemnification:
32 1. Nothing in this compact shall be construed as a limitation on the
33 liability of any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct,
34 which shall be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.
35 2. The member states, commissioners, officers, executive directors,
36 employees, and agents of the commission shall be immune from suit and
37 liability, both personally and in their official capacity, for any
38 claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil
39 liability caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error,
40 or omission that occurred, or that the person against whom the claim is
41 made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope
42 of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that
43 nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person
44 from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused
45 by the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person. The
46 procurement of insurance of any type by the commission shall not in any
47 way compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
48 3. The commission shall defend any commissioner, officer, executive
49 director, employee, or agent of the commission in any civil action seek-
50 ing to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, er-
12
1 ror, or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employ-
2 ment, duties, or responsibilities, or as determined by the commission
3 that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis
4 for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, du-
5 ties, or responsibilities; provided that nothing herein shall be con-
6 strued to prohibit that person from retaining counsel at such person's
7 own expense; and provided further, that the actual or alleged act, er-
8 ror, or omission did not result from that person's intentional or will-
9 ful or wanton misconduct.
10 4. The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any commissioner,
11 member, officer, executive director, employee, or agent of the commis-
12 sion for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that
13 person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that
14 occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or respon-
15 sibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing oc-
16 curred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsi-
17 bilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission
18 did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of
19 that person.
20 5. Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise
21 abrogate a member state's state action immunity or state action affir-
22 mative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman act,
23 Clayton act, or any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive
24 law or regulation.
25 6. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of
26 sovereign immunity by the member states or by the commission.
27 SECTION 8
28 DATA SYSTEM
29 A. The commission shall provide for the development, maintenance, op-
30 eration, and utilization of a coordinated database and reporting system con-
31 taining licensure, adverse action, and the presence of significant inves-
32 tigative information.
33 B. Notwithstanding any other provision of state law to the contrary, a

35 the rules of the commission, including but not limited to:
36 1. Identifying information;
37 2. Licensure data;
38 3. Adverse actions against a licensee, license applicant, or compact
39 privilege holder and information related thereto;

5 nal history record information, as defined by applicable federal law, to the
6 data system established under this section.
7 D. The records and information provided to a member state pursuant to
8 this compact or through the data system, when certified by the commission or

11 relevant judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative proceedings in a mem-
12 ber state.
13 E. Significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in
14 any member state will only be available to other member states.
15 F. It is the responsibility of the member states to report any adverse
16 action against a licensee and to monitor the database to determine whether
17 adverse action has been taken against a licensee. Adverse action informa-
18 tion pertaining to a licensee in any member state will be available to any
19 other member state.
20 G. Member states contributing information to the data system may desig-
21 nate information that may not be shared with the public without the express
22 permission of the contributing state.

26 SECTION 9
27 RULEMAKING
28 A. The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effec-
29 tively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions
30 of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if
31 a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the
32 commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the
33 scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based
34 on another applicable standard of review.
35 B. For purposes of this compact, the rules of the commission shall have
36 the force of law in each member state.
37 C. The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the
38 criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules
39 shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule.
40 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule
41 or portion of a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same man-
42 ner used to adopt the compact within four (4) years of the date of adoption of
43 the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member
44 state.
45 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commis-
46 sion.
14
1 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a
2 public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data,
3 facts, opinions, and arguments.
4 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission and at least
5 thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the commission will hold a
6 public hearing on the proposed rule, the commission shall provide a notice of
7 proposed rulemaking:
8 1. On the website of the commission or other publicly accessible plat-
9 form;
10 2. To persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices of
11 proposed rulemaking; and
12 3. In such other ways as the commission may by rule specify.
13 H. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
14 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the com-
15 mission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if differ-
16 ent, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the commission
17 will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
18 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or
19 other means of communication, the mechanism for access to the hearing;
20 3. The text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
21 4. A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested per-
22 son; and
23 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
24 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all writ-
25 ten comments and documents received by the commission in response to the pro-
26 posed rule shall be available to the public.
27 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
28 hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commis-
29 sion at hearings required by this section.
30 K. The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take
31 final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full
32 text of the rule.
33 1. The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule, provided the
34 changes are consistent with the original purpose of the proposed rule.
35 2. The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for sub-
36 stantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for sub-
37 stantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
38 3. The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the
39 rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L. of this sec-
40 tion, the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than thirty (30)
41 days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
42 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may con-
43 sider and adopt an emergency rule with twenty-four (24) hours' notice, and
44 with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures
45 provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied
46 to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than ninety
47 (90) days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this sub-
48 section, an emergency rule is a rule that must be adopted immediately in or-
49 der to:
50 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
15
1 2. Prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;
2 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by
3 federal law or rule; or
4 4. Protect public health and safety.
5 M. The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may di-
6 rect revisions to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting ty-
7 pographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammati-
8 cal errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of
9 the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for
10 a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged
11 only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A
12 challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the commission prior to
13 the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take
14 effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision
15 may not take effect without the approval of the commission.
16 N. No member state's rulemaking process or procedural requirements
17 shall apply to the commission.
18 1. The commission shall have no authority over any member state's rule-
19 making process or procedural requirements that do not pertain to the
20 compact.
21 O. Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation of the commis-
22 sion, shall be construed to limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability
23 of a member state to enact and enforce laws, regulations, or other rules re-
24 lated to the practice of respiratory therapy in that state, where those laws,
25 regulations, or other rules are not inconsistent with the provisions of this
26 compact.
27 SECTION 10
28 OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
29 A. Oversight:
30 1. The executive and judicial branches of state government in each mem-
31 ber state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and
32 appropriate to implement this compact.
33 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commis-
34 sion shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent
35 jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located.
36 The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the ex-
37 tent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute reso-
38 lution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection
39 or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
40 malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
41 3. The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any
42 proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact
43 and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all pur-
44 poses. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall ren-
45 der a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or pro-
46 mulgated rules.
47 B. Default, technical assistance, and termination:
16
1 1. If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in
2 the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this com-
3 pact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written no-
4 tice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the
5 default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action
6 that the commission may take and shall offer training and specific tech-
7 nical assistance regarding the default.
8 2. The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the
9 other member states.
10 C. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
11 may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of
12 the commissioners of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and ben-
13 efits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the ef-
14 fective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the of-
15 fending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
16 default.
17 D. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after
18 all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of in-
19 tent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the default-
20 ing state's governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting
21 state's legislature, the defaulting state's respiratory therapy licensing
22 authority, and each of the member states' respiratory therapy licensing au-
23 thorities.
24 E. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
25 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termi-
26 nation, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of ter-
27 mination, if necessary.
28 F. Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that
29 state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees and compact privi-
30 lege holders of which the commission has a record within that state of such
31 termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses
32 granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180)
33 days after the date of said notice of termination.
34 G. The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is
35 found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless
36 agreed on in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.
37 H. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by peti-
38 tioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the
39 federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The pre-
40 vailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including rea-
41 sonable attorney's fees.
42 I. Dispute resolution:
43 1. Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to re-
44 solve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and
45 between member and non-member states.
46 2. The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation
47 and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.
48 J. Enforcement:
49 1. By a majority vote, as may be further provided by rule, the commis-
50 sion may initiate legal action against a member state in default in the
17
1 United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal
2 district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce com-
3 pliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. A
4 member state by enactment of this compact consents to venue and juris-
5 diction in such court for the purposes set forth in this section. The
6 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the
7 event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
8 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's
9 fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
10 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available un-
11 der federal law or the defaulting member state's law.
12 2. A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in
13 the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the
14 federal district where the commission has its principal offices to en-
15 force compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated
16 rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and dam-
17 ages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing
18 party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reason-
19 able attorney's fees.
20 3. No person other than a member state shall enforce this compact
21 against the commission.
22 SECTION 11
23 EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
24 A. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact
25 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.
26 1. On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall
27 convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven (7) member
28 states (charter member states) to determine if the statute enacted by
29 each such charter member state is materially different than the model
30 compact.
31 a. A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materi-
32 ally different from the model compact shall be entitled to the de-
33 fault process set forth in section 10 of this compact.
34 b. If any member state is later found to be in default, is ter-
35 minated, or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall re-
36 main in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if
37 the number of member states should be less than seven (7).
38 2. Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven (7) ini-
39 tial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in
40 this compact and commission rule to determine if their enactments are
41 materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify
42 for participation in the compact.
43 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance
44 of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the ef-
45 fective date of the compact or prior to the commission coming into exis-
46 tence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specif-
47 ically repudiated by the commission. The commission shall own and have
48 all rights to any intellectual property developed on behalf or in fur-
18
1 therance of the commission by individuals or entities involved in or-
2 ganizing or establishing the commission, as may be further set forth in
3 rules of the commission.
4 4. Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission's
5 initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules
6 and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in
7 that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission
8 shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact be-
9 comes law in that state.
10 B. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute
11 repealing the same.
12 1. A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred
13 eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing statute.
14 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the with-
15 drawing state's respiratory therapy licensing authority to comply with
16 the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this
17 compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
18 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a
19 state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all li-
20 censees and compact privilege holders of which the commission has a
21 record within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
22 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to
23 recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum
24 of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such notice of with-
25 drawal.
26 C. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
27 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between
28 a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provi-
29 sions of this compact.
30 D. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to
31 this compact shall become effective and binding on any member state until it
32 is enacted into the laws of all member states.
33 SECTION 12
34 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
35 A. This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall be lib-
36 erally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and
37 administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly autho-
38 rizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit
39 the commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
40 B. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase,
41 clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of compe-
42 tent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state,
43 of any state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States,
44 or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circum-
45 stance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
46 the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof
47 to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be af-
48 fected thereby.
19
1 C. Notwithstanding subsection B. of this section, the commission may
2 deny a state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the re-
3 quirements of section 10 of this compact, terminate a member state's partic-
4 ipation in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of
5 a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this
6 compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state,
7 the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member
8 states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all
9 severable matters.
10 SECTION 13
11 CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
12 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other
13 law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact.
14 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a
15 member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the
16 conflict, including any subsequently enacted state laws.
17 C. All permissible agreements between the commission and the member
18 states are binding in accordance with their terms.
19 D. Other than as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this compact
20 will impact initial licensure.
21 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
22 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
23 July 1, 2025.

31 1. Hold and maintain an active home state license as a respiratory ther-
32 apist;
33 2. Hold and maintain an active credential from the national board for

13 this section to maintain the compact privilege in a remote state. If those
14 requirements are met, no adverse actions are taken, and the licensee has paid
15 any applicable compact privilege renewal fees, then the licensee will main-
16 tain the licensee's compact privilege.
17 C. A licensee providing respiratory therapy in a remote state under the
18 compact privilege shall function within the scope of practice authorized by
19 the remote state for the type of respiratory therapist license the licensee
20 holds. Such procedures, actions, processes, and the circumstances under
21 which they may be undertaken may be established through means including but
22 not limited to statute, regulations, case law, and other processes available
23 to the state respiratory therapy licensing authority or other government
24 agency.
25 D. If a licensee's compact privilege in a remote state is removed by
26 the remote state, the individual shall lose or be ineligible for the compact
27 privilege in that remote state until the compact privilege is no longer lim-
28 ited or restricted by that state.
29 E. If a home state license is encumbered, the licensee shall lose the
30 compact privilege in all remote states until the following occur:
31 1. The home state license is no longer encumbered; and
32 2. Two (2) years have elapsed from the date on which the license is no
33 longer encumbered due to the adverse action.
34 F. Once a licensee with a restricted or limited license meets the re-
35 quirements of subsection E. of this section, the licensee must also meet the
36 requirements of subsection A. of this section to obtain a compact privilege
37 in a remote state.
38 SECTION 5

44 B. An active military member and the member's spouse shall not be re-
45 quired to pay to the commission for a compact privilege any fee that may oth-
46 erwise be charged by the commission. If a remote state chooses to charge a

6 tigative information of a remote state or the home state, as long as the mem-
7 ber state follows its own procedures for imposing adverse action.
8 C. Nothing in this compact shall override a member state's decision
9 that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse
10 action and that such participation shall remain non-public if required by
11 the member state's laws.
12 D. A remote state shall have the authority to:
13 1. Take adverse actions as set forth herein against a licensee's com-
14 pact privilege in that state;
15 2. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require
16 the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evi-
17 dence.
18 a. Subpoenas may be issued by a respiratory therapy licensing au-
19 thority in a member state for the attendance and testimony of wit-
20 nesses and the production of evidence.
21 b. Subpoenas issued by a respiratory therapy licensing author-
22 ity in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses
23 shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent ju-
24 risdiction in the latter state, according to the practice and pro-
25 cedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings
26 pending before it.
27 c. Subpoenas issued by a respiratory therapy licensing authority
28 in a member state for production of evidence from another member
29 state shall be enforced in the latter state, according to the prac-
30 tice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in
31 the proceedings pending before it.
32 d. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel ex-
33 penses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes
34 of the state where the witnesses or evidence are located;

36 the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any
37 adverse action taken against that licensee;

39 not issue a subpoena to gather evidence of conduct in another member
40 state that is lawful in such other member state for the purpose of taking
41 adverse action against a licensee's compact privilege or application
42 for compact privilege in that member state; and
43 5. Nothing in this compact authorizes a member state to impose dis-
44 cipline against a respiratory therapist's compact privilege in that
45 member state for the individual's otherwise lawful practice in another
46 state.
47 E. Joint investigations:
48 1. In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its respec-
49 tive respiratory therapy practice act or other applicable state law, a

7
1 member state may participate with other member states in joint inves-
2 tigations of licensees; provided, however, that a member state receiv-
3 ing such a request has no obligation to respond to any subpoena issued
4 regarding an investigation of conduct or practice that was lawful in a
5 member state at the time it was undertaken.
6 2. Member states shall share any significant investigative informa-
7 tion, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint
8 or individual investigation initiated under the compact. In sharing
9 such information between member state respiratory therapy licensing
10 authorities, all information obtained shall be kept confidential, ex-
11 cept as otherwise mutually agreed on by the sharing and receiving member
12 states.
13 F. Nothing in this compact may permit a member state to take any adverse
14 action against a licensee or holder of a compact privilege for conduct or
15 practice that was legal in the member state at the time it was undertaken.
16 G. Nothing in this compact may permit a member state to take disci-
17 plinary action against a licensee or holder of a compact privilege for
18 conduct or practice that was legal in the member state at the time it was
19 undertaken.

8 this compact or through the data system, when certified by the commission or
9 an agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated business records of the

11 relevant judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative proceedings in a mem-
12 ber state.
13 E. Significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in
14 any member state will only be available to other member states.
15 F. It is the responsibility of the member states to report any adverse
16 action against a licensee and to monitor the database to determine whether
17 adverse action has been taken against a licensee. Adverse action informa-
18 tion pertaining to a licensee in any member state will be available to any
19 other member state.
20 G. Member states contributing information to the data system may desig-
21 nate information that may not be shared with the public without the express

26 SECTION 9
27 RULEMAKING
28 A. The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effec-
29 tively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions
30 of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if
31 a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the
32 commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the
33 scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based
34 on another applicable standard of review.
35 B. For purposes of this compact, the rules of the commission shall have
36 the force of law in each member state.
37 C. The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the
38 criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules
39 shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule.
40 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule
41 or portion of a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same man-
42 ner used to adopt the compact within four (4) years of the date of adoption of
43 the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member
44 state.
45 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commis-
46 sion.

14
1 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a
2 public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data,
3 facts, opinions, and arguments.
4 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission and at least
5 thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the commission will hold a
6 public hearing on the proposed rule, the commission shall provide a notice of
7 proposed rulemaking:
8 1. On the website of the commission or other publicly accessible plat-
9 form;
10 2. To persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices of
11 proposed rulemaking; and
12 3. In such other ways as the commission may by rule specify.
13 H. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
14 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the com-
15 mission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if differ-
16 ent, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the commission
17 will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
18 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or
19 other means of communication, the mechanism for access to the hearing;
20 3. The text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
21 4. A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested per-
22 son; and
23 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
24 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all writ-
25 ten comments and documents received by the commission in response to the pro-
26 posed rule shall be available to the public.
27 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
28 hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commis-
29 sion at hearings required by this section.
30 K. The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take
31 final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full
32 text of the rule.
33 1. The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule, provided the
34 changes are consistent with the original purpose of the proposed rule.
35 2. The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for sub-
36 stantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for sub-
37 stantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
38 3. The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the
39 rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L. of this sec-
40 tion, the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than thirty (30)
41 days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
42 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may con-
43 sider and adopt an emergency rule with twenty-four (24) hours' notice, and
44 with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures
45 provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied
46 to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than ninety
47 (90) days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this sub-
48 section, an emergency rule is a rule that must be adopted immediately in or-
49 der to:
50 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;

15
1 2. Prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;
2 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by
3 federal law or rule; or
4 4. Protect public health and safety.
5 M. The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may di-
6 rect revisions to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting ty-
7 pographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammati-
8 cal errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of
9 the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for
10 a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged
11 only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A
12 challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the commission prior to
13 the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take
14 effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision
15 may not take effect without the approval of the commission.
16 N. No member state's rulemaking process or procedural requirements
17 shall apply to the commission.
18 1. The commission shall have no authority over any member state's rule-
19 making process or procedural requirements that do not pertain to the
20 compact.
21 O. Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation of the commis-
22 sion, shall be construed to limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability
23 of a member state to enact and enforce laws, regulations, or other rules re-
24 lated to the practice of respiratory therapy in that state, where those laws,
25 regulations, or other rules are not inconsistent with the provisions of this
26 compact.
27 SECTION 10
28 OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
29 A. Oversight:
30 1. The executive and judicial branches of state government in each mem-
31 ber state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and
32 appropriate to implement this compact.
33 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commis-
34 sion shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent
35 jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located.
36 The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the ex-
37 tent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute reso-
38 lution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection
39 or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
40 malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
41 3. The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any
42 proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact
43 and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all pur-
44 poses. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall ren-
45 der a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or pro-
46 mulgated rules.
47 B. Default, technical assistance, and termination:

16
1 1. If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in
2 the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this com-
3 pact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written no-
4 tice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the
5 default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action
6 that the commission may take and shall offer training and specific tech-
7 nical assistance regarding the default.
8 2. The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the
9 other member states.
10 C. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
11 may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of
12 the commissioners of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and ben-
13 efits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the ef-
14 fective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the of-
15 fending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
16 default.
17 D. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after
18 all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of in-
19 tent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the default-
20 ing state's governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting
21 state's legislature, the defaulting state's respiratory therapy licensing
22 authority, and each of the member states' respiratory therapy licensing au-
23 thorities.
24 E. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
25 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termi-
26 nation, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of ter-
27 mination, if necessary.
28 F. Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that
29 state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees and compact privi-
30 lege holders of which the commission has a record within that state of such
31 termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses
32 granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180)
33 days after the date of said notice of termination.
34 G. The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is
35 found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless
36 agreed on in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.
37 H. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by peti-
38 tioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the
39 federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The pre-
40 vailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including rea-
41 sonable attorney's fees.
42 I. Dispute resolution:
43 1. Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to re-
44 solve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and
45 between member and non-member states.
46 2. The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation
47 and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.
48 J. Enforcement:
49 1. By a majority vote, as may be further provided by rule, the commis-
50 sion may initiate legal action against a member state in default in the

17
1 United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal
2 district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce com-
3 pliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. A
4 member state by enactment of this compact consents to venue and juris-
5 diction in such court for the purposes set forth in this section. The
6 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the
7 event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
8 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's
9 fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
10 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available un-
11 der federal law or the defaulting member state's law.
12 2. A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in
13 the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the
14 federal district where the commission has its principal offices to en-
15 force compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated
16 rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and dam-
17 ages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing
18 party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reason-
19 able attorney's fees.
20 3. No person other than a member state shall enforce this compact
21 against the commission.
22 SECTION 11
23 EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
24 A. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact
25 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.
26 1. On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall
27 convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven (7) member
28 states (charter member states) to determine if the statute enacted by
29 each such charter member state is materially different than the model
30 compact.
31 a. A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materi-
32 ally different from the model compact shall be entitled to the de-
33 fault process set forth in section 10 of this compact.
34 b. If any member state is later found to be in default, is ter-
35 minated, or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall re-
36 main in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if
37 the number of member states should be less than seven (7).
38 2. Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven (7) ini-
39 tial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in
40 this compact and commission rule to determine if their enactments are
41 materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify
42 for participation in the compact.
43 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance
44 of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the ef-
45 fective date of the compact or prior to the commission coming into exis-
46 tence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specif-
47 ically repudiated by the commission. The commission shall own and have
48 all rights to any intellectual property developed on behalf or in fur-

18
1 therance of the commission by individuals or entities involved in or-
2 ganizing or establishing the commission, as may be further set forth in
3 rules of the commission.
4 4. Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission's
5 initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules
6 and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in
7 that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission
8 shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact be-
9 comes law in that state.
10 B. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute
11 repealing the same.
12 1. A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred
13 eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing statute.
14 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the with-
15 drawing state's respiratory therapy licensing authority to comply with
16 the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this
17 compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
18 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a
19 state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all li-
20 censees and compact privilege holders of which the commission has a
21 record within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
22 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to
23 recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum
24 of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such notice of with-
25 drawal.
26 C. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
27 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between
28 a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provi-
29 sions of this compact.
30 D. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to
31 this compact shall become effective and binding on any member state until it
32 is enacted into the laws of all member states.
33 SECTION 12
34 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
35 A. This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall be lib-
36 erally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and
37 administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly autho-
38 rizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit
39 the commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
40 B. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase,
41 clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of compe-
42 tent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state,
43 of any state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States,
44 or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circum-
45 stance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
46 the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof
47 to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be af-
48 fected thereby.

19
1 C. Notwithstanding subsection B. of this section, the commission may
2 deny a state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the re-
3 quirements of section 10 of this compact, terminate a member state's partic-
4 ipation in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of
5 a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this
6 compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state,
7 the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member
8 states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all
9 severable matters.
10 SECTION 13
11 CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
12 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other
13 law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact.
14 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a
15 member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the
16 conflict, including any subsequently enacted state laws.
17 C. All permissible agreements between the commission and the member
18 states are binding in accordance with their terms.
19 D. Other than as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this compact
20 will impact initial licensure.
21 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
22 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
23 July 1, 2025.
