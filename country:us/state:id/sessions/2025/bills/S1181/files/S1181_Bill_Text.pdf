30 a phased-in schedule for transitioning from county-provided facilities to
31 state-owned or state-leased facilities during the period of July 1, 2027,
32 through July 1, 2029. Such plan shall prioritize first transitioning to
33 state-owned or state-leased facilities in those counties determined by the

8
1 charge of having committed, or is being detained under a conviction of, a se-
2 rious crime is entitled:

6 sentation, including investigation and other preparation. The attor-
7 ney, services and facilities, and the court costs shall be provided at

22 would be willing to bring at his own expense and is therefore a frivolous
23 proceeding.

25 subsection (1) of this section shall include the following cases, excluding
26 those cases where the state appellate public defender has jurisdiction pur-

48 SECTION 8. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
49 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
