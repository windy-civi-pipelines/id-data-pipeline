27 of guilt against the defendant is reversed upon appeal, the time that elapsed
28 between the date of the commission of the offense and the date the defendant
29 pleads guilty or is found guilty following the appeal shall also be excluded.
30 (9) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (4) and (6) of this
31 section, any person who has pled guilty to or has been found guilty of a
32 felony violation of the provisions of section 18-8004, Idaho Code, a felony

34 of the provisions of section 18-8006, Idaho Code, a violation of the provi-
35 sions of section 18-4006 3.(b), Idaho Code, notwithstanding the form of the
36 judgment(s) or withheld judgment(s) or any substantially conforming foreign
37 criminal felony violation, notwithstanding the form of the judgment(s) or
38 withheld judgment(s), and within fifteen (15) years pleads guilty to or is
39 found guilty of a further violation of the provisions of section 18-8004,
40 Idaho Code, shall be guilty of a felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to
41 subsection (6) of this section.
42 (10) For the purpose of subsections (4), (6) and (9) of this section and
43 the provisions of section 18-8004C, Idaho Code, a substantially conforming
44 foreign criminal violation exists when a person has pled guilty to or has
45 been found guilty of a violation of any federal law or law of another state,
46 or any valid county, city, or town ordinance of another state substantially
47 conforming to the provisions of section 18-8004, Idaho Code. The determina-
48 tion of whether a foreign criminal violation is substantially conforming is
49 a question of law to be determined by the court.

6
1 (11) Any person who pleads guilty to or is found guilty of a violation of
2 the provisions of section 18-8004, 18-8004C or 18-8006, Idaho Code, shall
3 undergo, at his own expense (or at county expense through the procedures set
4 forth in chapters 34 and 35, title 31, Idaho Code) and prior to the sentencing
5 date, an alcohol evaluation by a substance use disorders service provider
6 approved by the Idaho department of health and welfare; provided however, if
7 the defendant has no prior or pending charges with respect to the provisions
8 of section 18-8004, 18-8004C or 18-8006, Idaho Code, and the court has the
9 records and information required under subsection (12)(a), (b) and (c) of
10 this section or possesses information from other reliable sources relating
11 to the defendant's use or nonuse of alcohol or drugs that does not give the
12 court any reason to believe that the defendant regularly abuses alcohol or
13 drugs and is in need of treatment, the court may, in its discretion, waive the
14 evaluation with respect to sentencing for a violation of section 18-8004 or
15 18-8004C(1), Idaho Code, and proceed to sentence the defendant. The court
16 may also, in its discretion, waive the requirement of an alcohol evaluation
17 with respect to a defendant's first violation of the provisions of section
18 18-8004, 18-8004C or 18-8006, Idaho Code, and proceed to sentence the de-
19 fendant if the court has a presentence investigation report, substance use
20 disorder assessment, criminogenic risk assessment, or other assessment
21 that evaluates the defendant's degree of alcohol abuse and need for alcohol
22 treatment conducted within twelve (12) months preceding the date of the
23 defendant's sentencing. In the event an alcohol evaluation indicates the
24 need for alcohol treatment, the evaluation shall contain a recommendation
25 by the evaluator as to the most appropriate treatment program, together with
26 the estimated cost thereof, and recommendations for other suitable alter-
27 native treatment programs, together with the estimated costs thereof. The
28 person shall request that a copy of the completed evaluation be forwarded
29 to the court. The court shall take the evaluation into consideration in
30 determining an appropriate sentence. If a copy of the completed evaluation
31 has not been provided to the court, the court may proceed to sentence the
32 defendant; however, in such event, it shall be presumed that alcohol treat-
33 ment is required unless the defendant makes a showing by a preponderance of
34 evidence that treatment is not required. If the defendant has not made a good
35 faith effort to provide the completed copy of the evaluation to the court,
36 the court may consider the failure of the defendant to provide the report
37 as an aggravating circumstance in determining an appropriate sentence. If
38 treatment is ordered, in no event shall the person or facility doing the
39 evaluation be the person or facility that provides the treatment unless this
40 requirement is waived by the sentencing court, with the exception of fed-
41 erally recognized Indian tribes or federal military installations, where
42 diagnosis and treatment are appropriate and available. Nothing herein con-
43 tained shall preclude the use of funds authorized pursuant to the provisions
44 of chapter 3, title 39, Idaho Code, for court-ordered alcohol treatment for
45 indigent defendants.
46 (12) At the time of sentencing, the court shall be provided with the fol-
47 lowing information:
48 (a) The results, if administered, of any evidentiary test for alcohol
49 and/or drugs;

7
1 (b) A computer or teletype or other acceptable copy of the person's
2 driving record;
3 (c) Information as to whether the defendant has pled guilty to or
4 been found guilty of a violation of the provisions of section 18-8004,
5 18-8004C or 18-8006, Idaho Code, or a similar offense within the past
6 five (5) years, notwithstanding the form of the judgment(s) or withheld
7 judgment(s); and
8 (d) The alcohol evaluation required in subsection (11) of this section,
9 if any.
10 (13) At the time of sentencing, the court shall inform the defendant
11 that a second or subsequent offense of driving while under the influence of
12 alcohol, drugs, or any other intoxicating substances that results in death
13 may be considered vehicular manslaughter and may result in stricter pun-
14 ishment, including a mandatory fixed term of imprisonment of at least five
15 (5) years for a second offense and a mandatory fixed term of imprisonment
16 of at least ten (10) years for a third or subsequent offense, as provided in
17 section 18-4007(3)(b)(ii) and (iii), Idaho Code. Failure by the court to
18 inform the defendant of such information shall not prohibit the imposition
19 of a mandatory fixed term of imprisonment, and proof of knowledge of the
20 mandatory fixed term of imprisonment shall not be required for such term to
21 be imposed.
22 (13) (14) A minor may be prosecuted for a violation of the provisions of
23 section 18-8004 or 18-8004C, Idaho Code, under chapter 5, title 20, Idaho
24 Code. In addition to any other penalty, if a minor pleads guilty to or is
25 found guilty of a violation of the provisions of section 18-8004(1)(a),
26 (b) or (c) or 18-8004C, Idaho Code, he shall have his driving privileges
27 suspended or denied for an additional one (1) year following the end of any
28 period of suspension or revocation existing at the time of the violation,
29 or until he reaches the age of twenty-one (21) years, whichever period is
30 greater. During the period of additional suspension or denial, absolutely
31 no driving privileges shall be allowed.
32 (14) (15) In the event that the alcohol evaluation required in subsec-
33 tion (11) of this section recommends alcohol treatment, the court shall
34 order the person to complete a treatment program in addition to any other
35 sentence that may be imposed, unless the court determines that alcohol
36 treatment would be inappropriate or undesirable, in which event the court
37 shall enter findings articulating the reasons for such determination on
38 the record. The court shall order the defendant to complete the preferred
39 treatment program set forth in the evaluation, or a comparable alternative,
40 unless it appears that the defendant cannot reasonably obtain adequate fi-
41 nancial resources for such treatment. In that event, the court may order
42 the defendant to complete a less costly alternative set forth in the evalua-
43 tion, or a comparable program. Such treatment shall, to the greatest extent
44 possible, be at the expense of the defendant. In the event that funding is
45 provided for or on behalf of the defendant by an entity of state government,
46 restitution shall be ordered to such governmental entity in accordance with
47 the restitution procedure for crime victims, as specified under chapter
48 53, title 19, Idaho Code. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as
49 requiring a court to order that a governmental entity shall provide alcohol
50 treatment at government expense unless otherwise required by law.

8
1 (15) (16) Any person who is disqualified, or whose driving privileges
2 have been suspended, revoked or canceled under the provisions of this chap-
3 ter, shall not be granted restricted driving privileges to operate a commer-
4 cial motor vehicle.
5 (16) (17) As used in this section, "at his expense" includes the cost of
6 obtaining, installing, using and maintaining an ignition interlock system.

19 be sentenced to the county jail for a mandatory minimum period of not
20 less than thirty (30) days, the first forty-eight (48) hours of which

37 including a mandatory fixed term of imprisonment of at least five (5) years
38 for a second offense and a mandatory fixed term of imprisonment of at least
39 ten (10) years for a third or subsequent offense, as provided in section
40 18-4007(3)(b)(ii) and (iii), Idaho Code. Failure by the court to inform the
41 defendant of such information shall not prohibit the imposition of a manda-
42 tory fixed term of imprisonment, and proof of knowledge of the mandatory
43 fixed term of imprisonment shall not be required for such term to be imposed.
44 (2) (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any evidence of
