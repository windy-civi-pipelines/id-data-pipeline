12 -- PUBLIC HEARINGS. (1) A local government that requires building permits
13 shall publish a document that describes in detail the requirements of its
14 building permit process. The local government shall make the document
15 available to the public on its website and in physical form upon request.
16 (2) An applicant for a building permit shall make a good faith effort
17 to ensure that an application for a building permit is complete and contains
18 all of the necessary documentation required by a local government pursuant
19 to the document required in subsection (1) of this section. In the event that
20 an applicant submits an incomplete application, the local government shall,
21 within ten (10) business days, inform the applicant of any missing informa-
22 tion needed to complete the application.
23 (3) Upon receipt of a complete application for a building permit, a lo-
24 cal government shall have ten (10) business days to review the application to
25 verify that the requirements of subsection (2) of this section have been met,
26 as well as to verify that all necessary legal descriptions are correct. No
27 later than the conclusion of the ten (10) business day review period, the lo-
28 cal government shall publish a notice of determination on the completeness
29 of the application.
30 (4) An applicant and a local government may agree in writing to a later
31 review deadline than required pursuant to this section. Prior to any such
32 agreement, a local government shall provide written notice to an applicant
33 explaining why it is unable to meet the ten (10) business day review deadline
34 pursuant to subsection (3) of this section.
35 (5) Once the local government has determined the application to be
36 complete, and the requirements of subsections (2) and (3) of this section
37 have been met, the local government's relevant final reviewing department or
38 agency that will give final approval or denial of the application, such as
39 the local government's building permit board, shall schedule a public hear-
40 ing within forty-five (45) business days from when the application is deemed
41 complete, when necessary.
