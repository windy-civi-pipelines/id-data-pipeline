8 cluding school buildings, administration buildings, playgrounds, athletic
9 fields, etc., used by schoolchildren or school personnel in the normal
10 course of providing a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free
11 common schools, but does not include areas, buildings or parts of buildings
12 closed from or not used in the normal course of providing a general, uniform
13 and thorough system of public, free common schools. The aspects of a safe en-
14 vironment conducive to learning as provided by section 33-1612, Idaho Code,
15 that pertain to the physical plant used to provide a general, uniform and
16 thorough system of public, free common schools are hereby defined as those
17 necessary to comply with the safety and health requirements set forth in this
18 section.
19 (2) Inspection. It is the duty of the board of trustees of every school
20 district and the governing body for other schools described in subsection
21 (1) of this section at least once in every school year to require an indepen-
22 dent inspection of the school district's or other entity's school facilities
23 to determine whether those school facilities comply with codes addressing
24 safety and health standards for facilities, including electrical, plumbing,
25 mechanical, elevator, fire safety, boiler safety, life safety, structural,
26 snow loading, and sanitary codes, adopted by or pursuant to the Idaho uni-
27 form school building safety act, chapter 80, title 39, Idaho Code, adopted
28 by the state fire marshal, adopted by generally applicable local ordinances,
29 or adopted by rule of the state board of education and applicable to school
30 facilities. The inspection shall be done pursuant to chapter 80, title 39,
31 Idaho Code, or by an independent inspector professionally qualified to con-
32 duct inspections under the applicable code. The results of the inspection
33 shall be presented to the administrator of the division of occupational and
34 professional licenses and the board of trustees or other governing body for
35 its review and consideration.
36 (3) Abatement required -- Reporting. The board of trustees or other
37 governing body shall require that the unsafe or unhealthy conditions be
38 abated and shall instruct the school district's or other entity's person-
39 nel to take necessary steps to abate unsafe or unhealthy conditions. The
40 board of trustees or other governing body must issue a report in the same
41 school year in which the inspections are made declaring whether any unsafe
42 or unhealthy conditions identified have not been abated. The state board
43 of education shall, by rule, provide for uniform reporting of unsafe and
44 unhealthy conditions and for uniform reporting of abatement or absence of
45 abatement of unsafe and unhealthy conditions. Copies of such reports shall
46 be provided to the administrator of the division of occupational and profes-
47 sional licenses and the board of trustees of the school district.
48 (4) Costs of and plan of abatement. If the school district or other en-
49 tity described in subsection (1) of this section can abate all unsafe or un-

5
1 healthy conditions identified with the funds available to the school dis-
2 trict or other entity, it shall do so, and it need not separately account for
3 the costs of abatement nor segregate funds expended for abatement. If the
4 school district or other entity cannot abate all unsafe or unhealthy con-
5 ditions identified with the funds available to it, the board of trustees or
6 other governing body shall direct that a plan of abatement be prepared. The
7 plan of abatement shall provide a timetable that shall begin no later than
8 the following school year and that shall provide for abatement with all de-
9 liberate speed of unsafe and unhealthy conditions identified. The abatement
10 plan shall be submitted to the administrator of the division of occupational
11 and professional licenses. The school district or other entity shall imme-
12 diately begin to implement its plan of abatement and must separately account
13 for its costs of abatement of unsafe and unhealthy conditions and separately
14 segregate funds for the abatement of unsafe and unhealthy conditions as re-
15 quired by subsection (5) of this section.
16 (5) Special provisions for implementation of plan of abatement.
17 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law concerning expenditure
18 of lottery moneys distributed to the school district or other entity,
19 all lottery moneys provided to the school district or other entity for
20 a school year in which the school district cannot abate unsafe or un-
21 healthy conditions identified and not legally encumbered to other uses
22 at the time and all lottery moneys for following school years shall be
23 segregated and expended exclusively for abatement of unsafe and un-
24 healthy conditions identified until all of the unhealthy and unsafe
25 conditions identified are abated, provided, if the school district
26 has obtained a loan from the school safety and health revolving loan
27 and grant fund, the provisions of section 33-1017, Idaho Code, and the
28 conditions of the loan shall determine the use of the school district's
29 lottery moneys during the term of the loan.
30 (b) If the lottery moneys referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsec-
31 tion will, in the board of trustees' or other governing bodies' esti-
32 mation, be insufficient to abate the unsafe and unhealthy conditions
33 identified, the plan of abatement shall identify additional sources of
34 funds to complete the abatement of the unsafe and unhealthy conditions.
35 The board of trustees may choose from among the following sources, or
36 from other sources of its own identification, but the plan of abatement
37 must identify sufficient sources of funds for abatement.
38 (i) If the school district is not levying under chapter 8, ti-
39 tle 33, Idaho Code, at the maximum levies allowed by law for levies
40 that may be imposed by a board of trustees without an election, the
41 board of trustees may increase any of those levies as allowed by
42 law for the school year following the school year in which it was
43 unable to abate unsafe or unhealthy conditions identified.
44 (ii) If the school district is levying under chapter 8, title 33,
45 Idaho Code, at the maximum levies allowed by law for levies that
46 may be imposed by the board of trustees without an election; or,
47 if, after increasing those levies to the maximum levies allowed by
48 law for levies that may be imposed by the board of trustees with-
49 out an election, there will still be insufficient funds to abate
50 unsafe or unhealthy conditions identified, the school district,

6
1 after giving notice and conducting a hearing, may declare a finan-
2 cial emergency and/or may apply for a loan or, if eligible, an in-
3 terest grant from the school safety and health revolving loan and
4 grant fund as provided in section 33-1017, Idaho Code, to obtain
5 funds to abate the unsafe or unhealthy conditions identified.
6 (iii) Upon the declaration of a financial emergency, the board of
7 trustees shall have the power to impose a reduction in force, to
8 freeze some or all salaries in the school district, and/or to sus-
9 pend some or all contracts that may be legally suspended upon the
10 declaration of a financial emergency; provided, that when a board
11 of trustees declares a financial emergency, or when a declaration
12 of a financial emergency is imposed by the state treasurer pur-
13 suant to section 33-1017, Idaho Code, and there is a reduction in
14 force, some or all salaries are frozen, or some contracts are sus-
15 pended, the payments to the school district under the foundation
16 program of chapter 10, title 33, Idaho Code, and in particular the
17 staff allowances under that chapter, shall not be reduced during
18 the duration of the financial emergency as a result of a reduction
19 in force, frozen salaries, or suspended salaries from what the
20 staff allowance would be without the reduction in force, frozen
21 salaries or suspended contracts.
22 (c) All costs of abatement for a program implementing plans of abate-
23 ment under subsection (5) of this section this subsection must be
24 separately accounted for and documented with regard to abatement of
25 each unsafe or unhealthy condition identified. Funds obtained under
26 section 33-1017, Idaho Code, must be used exclusively to abate unsafe
27 or unhealthy conditions identified. Funds obtained pursuant to section
28 33-1017, Idaho Code, in excess of funds necessary to abate unsafe or
29 unhealthy conditions identified must be returned as provided in section
30 33-1017, Idaho Code. Return of these funds shall be judicially enforce-
31 able as provided in section 33-1017, Idaho Code.

33 amended to read as follows:

36 Code, may issue an order for state supervision of a local school district.
37 When an order for state supervision of a local school district is entered by
38 the district court, the superintendent of public instruction shall within
39 thirty-five (35) calendar days appoint, at local school district expense, an
40 officer to be known as a district supervisor. When an order for state super-
41 vision of a local school district is entered by the state board of education,
42 the district supervisor shall be appointed pursuant to section 33-909, Idaho
43 Code, at local school district expense. The district supervisor shall have
44 authority to approve or disapprove any actions of the board of the local
45 school district, to supervise or dismiss superintendents, assistant super-
46 intendents, and any other district administrative personnel, and to take
47 any actions necessary to further the local school district's obligations
48 to provide constitutionally required educational services. In the case
49 of appointment by the superintendent of public instruction, the district

7
1 supervisor shall serve at the pleasure of the superintendent of public in-
2 struction until removed by the superintendent of public instruction or the
3 superintendent of public instruction reports to the district court that the
4 local school district is in substantial compliance with its obligations to
5 provide constitutionally required educational services, or until the dis-
6 trict court, upon its own motion or upon motion of any of the parties, orders
7 state supervision to end. In the case of appointment by the state board of
8 education, the district supervisor shall serve pursuant to section 33-909,
9 Idaho Code.
10 SECTION 9. That Section 39-8011, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby

14 violates the provisions of this chapter, the state superintendent of pub-
15 lic instruction shall withhold such ensuing apportionments as are necessary
16 to make repairs to abate the identified imminent safety hazard or serious
17 safety hazard. Withheld funds, not to exceed one and one-half percent (1
18 1/2%) of the district's appropriation, shall be disbursed only to pay for
19 such repairs.
20 (2) If the funds that would be raised over two (2) fiscal years from ap-
21 plying the provisions of subsection (1) of this section are insufficient, in
22 combination with all moneys that will be available in the district's school
23 building maintenance allocation for the same period, to provide sufficient
24 moneys to abate the identified imminent or serious safety hazard, then the
25 administrator shall submit an application to abate said hazard to the Idaho
26 public school facilities cooperative funding program panel pursuant to sec-
27 tion 33-909, Idaho Code.
28 (3) (2) It is a misdemeanor to remove, without permission of the admin-
