36 (5) No officer or employee shall fail to use an open contract except as

48 vices influenced the procurement process to prepare the specifications
49 for the property.

11

4 sulting or other services to a state agency, or participating in leg-
5 islative committee meetings related to the property that is the subject
6 of planned solicitation as long as:

10 lated party, or affiliate or subsidiary of the vendor, can meet the
11 bid specifications;
12 (ii) Such technical assistance, consulting or other services,
13 or participation in legislative committee meetings does not oth-
14 erwise provide the vendor or related party, or affiliate or sub-
15 sidiary of the vendor, with a quantifiable and objective advantage
16 in the bid process; and
17 (iii) Any work product or written documentation produced as a re-
18 sult of the technical assistance, consulting or other services, or
19 participation in legislative committee meeting is accessible to
20 any requestor pursuant to a public records request.
21 (9) No person who has served in a public office within three hundred
22 sixty-five (365) days of a bid submission deadline may participate in the
23 solicitation, bid, or contract process pursuant to the provisions of this
24 chapter on behalf of a vendor.

41 section 67-9203, Idaho Code; and
42 (c) Vendors or any person acting on behalf of a vendor.
43 (2) In any matter relating to state procurement, it is an unethical
44 breach of the public trust to:
45 (a) Knowingly attempt to realize personal gain through state office or
46 employment by any conduct inconsistent with this chapter or any other
47 applicable law or rule;
48 (b) Attempt to influence a state officer or employee to violate the pol-
49 icy or provisions of this chapter or any other applicable law or rule; or

12
1 (c) Knowingly violate an applicable law or rule.
2 (3) Subject to due process requirements, and in addition to any other
3 administrative, civil or criminal sanctions provided by law or rule, a state
4 employee's supervisor may impose the following sanctions on the employee for
5 an unethical breach of the public trust:
6 (a) A reprimand or warning, either oral or written;
7 (b) Suspension with or without pay for a specified period of time; or
8 (c) Termination of employment.
9 (4) In addition to any other administrative, civil or criminal sanction
10 provided by law or rule, a vendor who commits an unethical breach of the pub-
11 lic trust, or whose advocate or representative commits an unethical breach

13 Code.
14 (5) Vendors, employees of vendors, or any person acting on behalf of
