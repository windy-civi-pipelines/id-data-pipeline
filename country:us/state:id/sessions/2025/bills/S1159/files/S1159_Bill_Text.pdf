19 cost of vehicles and equipment, training, licensing expenses, communica-
20 tion technology, dispatch services, and costs associated with assuring the
21 performance of planned coverage and emergency response, including highway
22 safety and emergency response to motor vehicle accidents.
23 (a) The division shall approve grants from the fund based on the follow-
24 ing criteria:

26 holds a current license as an ambulance or nontransport service
27 issued by the division;
28 (ii) The applicant has demonstrated need based on criteria estab-
29 lished by the division;

33 (iv) The applicant has certified that the title to any vehicle
34 purchased with funds from the fund shall be in the name of the fire
35 district, city, or county that endorsed the application and shall
36 submit proof of titling to the division as soon as practicable; and
37 (v) The state of Idaho shall retain a security interest in the ve-
38 hicle to secure the performance of the grant recipient to utilize
39 the vehicle consistent with the intent described in the applica-
40 tion.
41 (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(iii) and (iv) of
42 this subsection, the division is authorized to approve and issue a grant

2
1 to an applicant in the absence of an endorsement if the endorsement is
2 withheld without adequate justification.
3 (2) The division shall be responsible for distributing moneys, subject
4 to legislative appropriation, from the emergency medical services fund cre-
5 ated in section 57-829, Idaho Code. Moneys in the fund shall be used exclu-
6 sively for costs associated with emergency medical services. However, if
7 the legislature appropriates moneys to the fund for sustainability grants
8 to cover personnel and operating costs associated with assuring the sustain-
9 ability and availability of emergency medical services, applicants may only
10 be approved by the division subject to the following criteria:
11 (a) The applicant is a nonprofit or governmental entity that holds a
12 current emergency medical services agency license issued by the divi-
13 sion that authorizes the agency as a 911 response agency;
14 (b) The application clearly defines the applicant's service area spe-
15 cific to 911 response;
16 (c) The applicant must certify, if it is eligible to bill for services,
17 that it has billed health insurance carriers for at least eighty percent
18 (80%) of eligible billable services it provided in the previous year.
19 If the applicant is newly licensed and does not have twelve (12) months
20 of historical billing information, the applicant must certify that it
21 is currently billing and will continue to bill health insurance carri-
22 ers for at least eighty percent (80%) of eligible services; and
23 (d) If the applicant fulfills the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b),
24 and (c) of this subsection, the county in which the applicant provides
25 911 response services may, in its discretion, endorse the grant appli-
26 cation of the requesting entity. A county endorsing an application must
27 have submitted a plan that has been approved by the division that spec-
28 ifies how emergency medical services 911 responses shall be covered and
29 coordinated throughout the entire county.
30 (3) The provision of emergency medical services is a government func-
31 tion. If the division approves applications for sustainability grants
32 pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, counties are authorized and re-
33 quired to ensure that emergency medical services are reasonably available
34 throughout the county.
35 (4) It is the intent of the legislature that counties that accept sus-
36 tainability grants pursuant to subsection (2) of this section use a portion
37 of the sustainability grant to implement or maintain community health EMS in
38 the service area.
39 SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby
40 declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after
