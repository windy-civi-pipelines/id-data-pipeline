30 amended to read as follows:
31 67-7008. CERTIFICATE OF NUMBER -- EXPIRATION -- FEES. (1) Within fif-
32 teen (15) days after purchase, or as otherwise provided in this section, the
33 owner of each vessel requiring numbering by the state of Idaho shall file an
34 application for a certificate of number with an assessor or authorized ven-
35 dor on forms provided by the department. The application shall be signed
36 by the owner and shall be accompanied by the fee designated in this section.
37 Upon receipt of an application in approved form and the appropriate fee, the
38 assessor or authorized vendor shall enter the same on the records of its of-
39 fice and issue to the applicant two (2) validation stickers and a certifi-
40 cate of number, the receipt of any fee paid, and the name and address of the
41 owner. The owner shall also receive a vessel number that shall be perma-
42 nently assigned to the boat. The owner shall paint on or permanently attach

2
1 to each side of the bow of the vessel the vessel number and validation sticker
2 in a manner as may be prescribed by rules of the department in order that
3 they may be completely visible, and the number shall be maintained in legi-
4 ble condition. The certificate of number shall be pocket-size and shall be
5 on board and available at all times for inspection on the vessel for which is-
6 sued whenever that vessel is in operation, except that livery operators may
7 have the rental agreement on board rented vessels in lieu of the certificate
8 of number.
9 (2) The owner of any vessel for which a current certificate of number
10 has been issued pursuant to any federal law or a federally approved numbering
11 system of another state shall, if the vessel is operated on the waters of this
12 state in excess of sixty (60) days, make application for an Idaho certificate
13 of number in the manner prescribed in this section. Each assessor and autho-
14 rized vendor shall record, on a form provided by the department, the names of
15 all owners of vessels who make application for certificates of number, to-
16 gether with the amount of the fees paid by the owners.

18 shall be kept current and shall be public records.
19 (4) Every certificate of number issued shall continue in full force and
20 effect through December 31 of the year displayed on the validation sticker
21 unless sooner terminated or discontinued in accordance with law. Certifi-
22 cates of number may be renewed by the owner in the same manner provided for in
23 the initial securing of them.
24 (5) The owner of any vessel shall notify the department within fif-
25 teen (15) days if his vessel is destroyed or abandoned, or if it is sold
26 or transferred either wholly or in part to another person or persons, or
27 if the owner's address no longer conforms to the address appearing on the
28 certificate of number. In all such cases, the notice shall be accompanied
29 by a surrender of the certificate of number. When the surrender of the cer-
30 tificate is by reason of the vessel being destroyed, abandoned or sold, the
31 department shall cancel the certificate and enter that fact in its records.
32 If the surrender is by reason of a change of address on the part of the owner,
33 the new address shall be endorsed on the certificate and the certificate
34 returned to the owner.

36 within fifteen (15) days after acquisition, make application to the depart-
37 ment for transfer to him of the certificate of number issued for the vessel,
38 giving his name, address, and the vessel number and shall, at the same time,
39 pay to the department a transfer fee of three dollars ($3.00). Upon receipt
40 of the application and fee, the department shall transfer the certificate of
41 number issued for the vessel to the new owner or owners. Unless the applica-
42 tion is made and the fee paid within fifteen (15) days, the vessel shall be
43 considered to be without a certificate of number.
44 (7) No numbers other than the validation stickers and vessel number is-
45 sued to a vessel or granted by reciprocity pursuant to law shall be painted,
46 attached, or otherwise displayed on either side of the bow of the vessel.

48 the owner of the vessel for which the same was issued shall obtain a dupli-
49 cate of the certificate from the department upon application and the payment
50 of a fee of three dollars ($3.00). If one or both validation stickers are

3

9 ($13.00) for each certificate. Certificates of number so issued may be used
