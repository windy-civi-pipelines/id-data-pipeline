6 FECTIVE DATE.
7 Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:
8 SECTION 1. That Section 63-208, Idaho Code, as amended in Section 1 of
9 House Bill No. 354, as enacted by the First Regular Session of the Sixty-
10 eighth Idaho Legislature, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as fol-
11 lows:
12 63-208. RULES PERTAINING TO MARKET VALUE -- DUTY OF ASSESSORS. (1) It
13 shall be the duty of the state tax commission to prepare and distribute to
14 each county assessor and the county commissioners within the state of Idaho
15 rules prescribing and directing the manner in which market value for assess-
16 ment purposes is to be determined for the purpose of taxation. The rules
17 promulgated by the state tax commission shall require each assessor to find
18 market value for assessment purposes of all property, except that expressly
19 exempt under chapter 6, title 63, Idaho Code, within his county according to
20 recognized appraisal methods and techniques as set forth by the state tax
21 commission; provided, that the actual and functional use shall be a major
22 consideration when determining market value for assessment purposes. The
23 recognized appraisal methods shall, at a minimum, require the assessment
24 of such property to reflect, within reasonable statistical certainty, the
25 median ratio of assessed value to market value for the categories of prop-
26 erty being tested within a range of ninety percent (90%) to one hundred ten
27 percent (110%) of such median ratio market value, using statistical methods
28 such as confidence intervals to determine compliance and requiring cor-
29 rective actions if the ratio falls outside of this range. Each category of
30 property tested shall also have a level of assessment that is provable with
31 reasonable statistical certainty to be not more than five (5) percentage
32 points different than that of each other category of property tested.
33 (2) To maximize uniformity and equity in assessment of different cat-
34 egories of property, such rules shall, to the extent practical, require the
35 use of reproduction or replacement cost less depreciation as opposed to his-
36 toric cost less depreciation whenever cost is considered as a single or one
37 (1) of several factors in establishing the market value of depreciable prop-
38 erty. The state tax commission shall also prepare and distribute amendments
39 and changes to the rules as shall be necessary in order to carry out the in-
40 tent and purposes of this title. The rules shall be in the form as the commis-
41 sion shall direct, and shall be made available upon request to other public
42 officers and the general public in reasonable quantities without charge. In
2
1 ascertaining the market value for assessment purposes of any item of prop-
2 erty, the assessor of each county shall, and is required to, abide by, adhere
3 to and conform with rules promulgated by the state tax commission.
4 (3) When establishing the real property market value for assessment
5 purposes of income-producing property, the assessor may use one (1) or more
6 market valuation methods, provided that the market value shall not include
7 contract rent related to the real estate only and shall exclude any value
8 of exempt intangible personal property as provided in section 63-602L,
9 Idaho Code. Upon request by the property owner, the assessor shall provide
10 the property owner with the assessor's calculations used to derive the in-
11 come-producing property owner's market value, including any value exempted
12 by statute.
13 SECTION 2. This act shall be in full force and effect on and after Jan-
14 uary 1, 2026.
