19 ter the effective date of this subsection, a foreign government or a foreign
20 state-controlled enterprise shall not purchase, acquire, or hold any con-

22 claims, or mineral rights in the state of Idaho. This subsection does not
23 apply to any interest in agricultural land, forest land, water rights, min-

4 land, mining claims, or mineral rights within one hundred eighty (180) days

7 agricultural land or any interest in such land in this state must register
8 with the Idaho state department of agriculture within sixty (60) days of the
9 effective date of this act or the date of acquisition, whichever is latest.
10 The department must establish a form for such registration, which, at a mini-

33 lection of debts, provided that the foreign principal sells, transfers, or
34 otherwise divests itself of the agricultural land, mining claims, or mineral
35 rights within one hundred eighty (180) days of acquiring the agricultural
36 land, mining claims, or mineral rights.
37 (8) Any current deeds, contracts, rental agreements, or other legal
38 agreements in conflict with this law shall be deemed invalid from the date of
39 adoption unless otherwise provided.
40 (9) The Idaho state department of agriculture and department of lands
41 shall adopt rules, subject to legislative approval, to implement the provi-
42 sions of this section.
43 (10) The responsibility for determining whether an entity is subject to
44 this section rests solely with the foreign entity, the attorney general, or
45 any qualifying whistleblower, and no other individual or entity. An indi-

17 (30%) of the proceeds of the land, mining claims, mineral rights, or asset
