11 liquor license. Upon a finding of proof by the mayor and city council and
12 subject to approval of the mayor and city council and notwithstanding the
13 population limitations set forth in section 23-903(1), Idaho Code, nothing
14 in this chapter shall prohibit the issuance of a city restaurant liquor li-
15 cense to the owner, operator, or lessee for use at a qualifying restaurant
16 within the incorporated limits of any city in this state, subject to the
17 provisions of this section. "Restaurant" shall have the same meaning as

19 (2) Qualifying restaurant. To be eligible for issuance of a city
20 restaurant liquor license, a restaurant shall demonstrate that the primary
21 source of revenue from the operation of the restaurant to be licensed will
22 be derived from food services and not from the sale of liquor. Subsequent
23 license renewals shall be conditioned upon a showing that no less than sixty
24 percent (60%) of gross sales from the preceding twelve (12) month operation
25 of a licensed restaurant be derived from food services. A city restaurant
26 liquor license may be issued to a food hall that houses multiple restaurants
27 under its roof, provided that no less than sixty percent (60%) of combined
28 gross sales from the preceding twelve (12) month operation from all restau-
29 rants in the food hall was derived from food services.
30 (3)(a) Restaurant operations. A restaurant selling liquor pursuant to
31 a city restaurant liquor license shall abide by the following:
32 (i) Liquor shall be dispensed and prepared for consumption by
33 a restaurant licensed pursuant to this section only in areas ap-
34 proved by the local licensing authority; and
35 (ii) All liquor sales shall cease at the time food sales and ser-
36 vices cease. The local licensing authority may impose additional
37 date and time restrictions on liquor sales.
38 (b) No city restaurant licensed pursuant to this section shall promote
39 or operate the restaurant as a bar and lounge.
40 (4)(a) Licenses per city. The number of city restaurant liquor li-
41 censes issued for use within the incorporated limits of a single city
42 shall be no fewer than three (3) but no more than the number of licenses

2
1 issued within a city pursuant to section 23-903(1), Idaho Code. In the
2 event the mayor and city council do not approve the proposed license, a
3 license shall not be issued. Priority shall be given on a first-come,
4 first-served basis according to date of application.
5 (b) City liquor licenses shall not count toward the limitation on the
6 number of licenses issued according to population, as provided in sec-
7 tion 23-903(1), Idaho Code.
8 (5) Sale, lease, and transfer prohibited. A city restaurant liquor li-
9 cense may not be sold or leased and shall not be transferable to any other lo-
10 cation, facility, or premises.

12 same as those set forth in section 23-904(1), (2), and (3), Idaho Code.
