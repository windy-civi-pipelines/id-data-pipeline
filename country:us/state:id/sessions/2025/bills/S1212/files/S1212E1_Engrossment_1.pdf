46 (i) Appears to a reasonable individual to be of a real event, ac-
47 tion, or speech that did not actually occur in reality; and
48 (ii) Provides a fundamentally different understanding or impres-
49 sion of the event, action, or speech than a reasonable person would

8 through the use of synthetic media in an electioneering communication, ex-
9 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure may bring an action for
10 general damages, special damages, or both against the information content
11 provider. The court may also award a prevailing party reasonable attorney's
12 fees and costs. The provisions of this subsection do not limit or preclude a
13 plaintiff from securing or recovering any other available remedy.
14 (5) It shall be an affirmative defense for any action brought pursuant
15 to this section that the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
16 candidate, or independent expenditure containing synthetic media includes
17 a disclosure stating, "This (video/audio) has been manipulated" in the fol-
18 lowing manner:

23 a clearly spoken manner and in a pitch that can be easily heard by the
24 average listener at the beginning of the audio, at the end of the au-
25 dio, and, if the audio is greater than two (2) minutes in length, in-
26 terspersed within the audio at intervals of no more than two (2) minutes

29 bears the burden of establishing the use of synthetic media by clear and
30 convincing evidence.

32 expediently.
33 (8) For an action brought pursuant to this section, the information
34 content provider of the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
35 candidate, or independent expenditure may be held liable and not the medium
36 disseminating the electioneering communication, expenditure by a candi-
37 date, or independent expenditure except as provided in subsection (9) of
38 this section.

40 censed broadcasting station transmits an electioneering communication, ex-
41 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure that is subject to 47
42 U.S.C. 315, a medium may be held liable in a cause of action brought pursuant
43 to this section if:
44 (a) The medium removes any disclosure described in subsection (5) of
45 this section from the electioneering communication, expenditure by a
46 candidate, or independent expenditure it disseminates; or
47 (b) Subject to affirmative defenses described in this section, the
48 medium changes the content of an electioneering communication, ex-
49 penditure by a candidate, or independent expenditure such that it
50 qualifies as synthetic media.

15
1 (10) No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be
2 treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another
3 information content provider. However, an interactive computer service may
4 be held liable in accordance with subsection (9) of this section.

2 and immunities vested by the urban renewal law of 1965, and as amended,
3 in an appointed board of commissioners, shall be vested in the local
4 governing body, which shall, in all respects when acting as an urban re-
5 newal agency, be acting as an arm of state government, entirely separate
6 and distinct from the municipality, to achieve, perform, and accomplish
7 the public purposes prescribed and provided by said urban renewal law of
8 1965, and as amended.
9 (d) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may termi-
10 nate the appointed board of commissioners and thereby appoint and des-
11 ignate itself as the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency
12 for not more than one (1) calendar year.
13 (e) By enactment of an ordinance, the local governing body may provide
14 that the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency shall be
15 elected at an election held for such purpose on one (1) of the November
16 dates provided in section 34-106, Idaho Code, and the ordinance may pro-
17 vide term limits for the commissioners. In this case, all the rights,
18 powers, duties, privileges, and immunities vested by the urban renewal
19 law of 1965, and as amended, in an appointed board of commissioners,
20 shall be vested in the elected board of commissioners of the urban
21 renewal agency, which shall, in all respects when acting as an urban re-
22 newal agency, be acting as an arm of state government, entirely separate
23 and distinct from the municipality, to achieve, perform, and accomplish
24 the public purposes prescribed and provided by said urban renewal law
25 of 1965, and as amended. The provisions of chapter 66, title 67 3, title
26 74, Idaho Code, shall apply to elected commissioners, and the county
27 election law shall apply to the person running for commissioner as if
28 the person were running for county commissioner. In the event of a
29 vacancy in an elected commissioner position, the replacement shall be
30 appointed by the mayor or chair of the board of county commissioners, if
31 that is the local governing body, by and with the advice and consent of
32 the local governing body, and shall be filled for the unexpired term.
33 (3) In all instances, a member of the board of commissioners of the ur-
34 ban renewal agency must be a resident of the county where the urban renewal
35 agency is located or is doing business.

37 shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including travel expenses, in-
38 curred in the discharge of his duties. Each commissioner shall hold office
39 until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of
40 the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the
41 clerk of the municipality and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence
42 of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner.
43 (5)(a) The powers of an urban renewal agency shall be exercised by the
44 commissioners thereof. A majority of the commissioners shall consti-
45 tute a quorum for the purpose of conducting business and exercising the
46 powers of the agency and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by
47 the agency upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, un-
48 less in any case the bylaws shall require a larger number.
49 (b) The commissioners shall elect the chairman, cochairman, or vice
50 chairman for a term of one (1) year from among their members. An agency

38
1 may employ an executive director, technical experts, and such other
2 agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and
3 determine their qualifications, duties, and compensation. For such
4 legal service as it may require, an agency may employ or retain its own
5 counsel and legal staff.
6 (c) An agency authorized to transact business and exercise powers un-
7 der this chapter shall file, with the local governing body, on or be-
8 fore March 31 of each year a report of its activities for the preced-
9 ing calendar year, which report shall include the financial data and au-
10 dit reports required under sections 67-1075 and 67-1076, Idaho Code.
11 The agency shall be required to hold a public meeting to report these
12 findings and take comments from the public. At the time of filing the
13 report, the agency shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation
14 in the community a notice to the effect that such report has been filed
15 with the municipality and the state controller and that the report is
16 available for inspection during business hours in the office of the city
17 clerk or county recorder, in the office of the agency, and at all times
18 on the website of the state controller.
19 (d) An urban renewal agency shall have the same fiscal year as a mu-
20 nicipality and shall be subject to the same audit requirements as a mu-
21 nicipality. An urban renewal agency shall be required to prepare and
22 file with its local governing body an annual financial report and shall
23 prepare, approve, and adopt an annual budget for filing with the local
24 governing body, for informational purposes. A budget means an annual
25 estimate of revenues and expenses for the following fiscal year of the
26 agency.
27 (6) An urban renewal agency shall comply with the public records law
28 pursuant to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, open meetings law pursuant to
29 chapter 2, title 74, Idaho Code, the ethics in government law pursuant to
30 chapter 4, title 74, Idaho Code, and the competitive bidding provisions of
31 chapter 28, title 67, Idaho Code.

33 of the urban renewal agency shall revert to the municipality.
