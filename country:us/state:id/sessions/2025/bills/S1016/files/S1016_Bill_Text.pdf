7 collected by the brand inspector, are due and payable at the time of inspec-
8 tion, but the brand board may, by rule, allow all of such fees to be paid on
9 a schedule that requires payment at least monthly, after receiving a request
10 for such delayed payment schedule and after such request is approved by the
11 state brand inspector. The brand board may require a security deposit to en-
12 sure the prompt payment of all fees owed to the state. Failure to pay as re-
13 quired shall be cause for the brand inspector to file an action in the dis-
14 trict court of the county wherein the inspection was made for the amount of
15 all fees owed, plus all costs and reasonable attorney's fees associated with
16 the action plus interest at the rate specified in section 28-22-104, Idaho
